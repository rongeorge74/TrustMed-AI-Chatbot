1,Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA),https://familydoctor.org/condition/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/,"The main blood vessel in your body is the aorta. It is a long blood vessel called an artery that reaches from your chest into your abdomen. It carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. The part of the aorta in your abdomen is called the abdominal aorta. It supplies blood to your stomach, pelvis, and legs.

Sometimes an area of a blood vessel wall will get weak. It can start to swell like a balloon and become abnormally large. This is called an aneurysm. If an aneurysm forms in your abdominal aorta and grows too large, your aorta could tear or burst.","As the aneurysm develops, there are usually no symptoms. This can go on slowly for years. Often, AAAs don’t cause symptoms unless they leak, tear, or rupture. If this happens, you may experience:

• Sudden pain in your abdomen, groin, back, legs, or buttocks
• Nausea and vomiting
• Abnormal stiffness in your abdominal muscles
• Rapid heart rate
• Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
• Problems with urination or bowel movements
• Clammy, sweaty skin

If you have these symptoms, go to the emergency room. Internal bleeding from a ruptured AAA can cause you to go into shock. Shock can be fatal if not treated right away","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes an AAA. Weaker aorta walls increase your chance of developing an aneurysm. There are many conditions that can weaken the walls of the aorta. These include aging, smoking, and high blood pressure. If any of the following factors apply to you, you are at higher risk of having an AAA.

• Being male. Men are more likely than women to develop an AAA.
• Age. AAAs are more common in people age 65 or older.
• Personal history. If you have had aneurysms of any kind, you are at greater risk of an AAA.
• Habits. Smoking damages and weakens the aorta walls.
• High blood pressure. Having high blood pressure weakens the walls of your aorta.
• Family history. If any family members have had AAAs, you are at higher risk. You also could get an AAA before you are 65.

Talk to your doctor if you have a higher risk for an AAA, or if you have any of the symptoms.","Doctors commonly find AAAs by chance during a routine exam. They also find them when testing for other issues, including pain in your abdomen. Doctors recommend an AAA screening for men ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked.

If your doctor finds or thinks you have an AAA, they may order tests. Common tests include:

• Ultrasound or echocardiogram – These use sound waves to create pictures of the inside of your body.
• Computed tomography (CT) scan – The doctor uses X-rays to take pictures of your organs. Dye may be injected into your veins so your doctor can see them clearly.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – This test uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of your organs.
• Angiography – This test uses dye and X-rays to look at the inside of your arteries. This can help your doctor see how much damage or blockage there is in your blood vessels.

If your doctor finds or thinks you might have an AAA, he or she might refer to you a specialist for treatment.","You can’t always prevent an AAA from forming. But there are steps you can take to lower your risk. These include:

• Don’t smoke. If you are a smoker, try to quit.
• Eat a healthy diet.
• Be physically active.
• Manage conditions such as high blood pressure that can be controlled with medicine.","Treatment for an AAA depends on its size. If your aneurysm is small, it might not need to be treated. Your doctor may just monitor it using routine testing. If your doctor is concerned about it, he or she may prescribe medicine. These can be used to lower blood pressure or relax blood vessels. This can help prevent the AAA from rupturing.

If your aneurysm is large or is growing quickly, you will most likely need surgery. There are 2 main kinds of surgery to remove or repair AAAs:

• Open abdominal surgery – This is the most common form of surgery for an AAA. The surgeon will make an incision (cut) in your abdomen. He or she will remove the aneurysm. The removed section of the aorta is replaced with a graft made of man-made material.
• Endovascular repair – In this procedure, the doctor inserts a graft into the aorta to strengthen it. He or she will insert a catheter (tube) into your artery through your leg. The graft will be threaded through the aneurysm and expanded. This will reinforce the weak section of the aorta and allow blood to flow normally. This helps keep the AAA from rupturing.

The type of surgery you have depends on many factors. Talk to your doctor about which kind is best for you.","If you have an AAA, it is important to get regular medical care. Listen to your doctor and follow your treatment plan. He or she may advise you to avoid lifting heavy objects. Try to avoid highly emotional situations or crises that could raise your blood pressure. Take care of yourself to prevent the aneurysm from bursting or tearing.","• If I’ve had one AAA, am I likely to experience another?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to avoid getting another AAA?
• Is watchful waiting safe? Is there a chance the AAA could burst?
• Are there any side effects from an AAA that I should be watching for?
• What should I do if my pain gets worse?
• Should I visit a specialist?","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Aortic Aneurysm

2,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,https://familydoctor.org/condition/abnormal-uterine-bleeding/,"Abnormal uterine bleeding is any heavy or unusual bleeding from the uterus (through your vagina). It can occur at any time during your monthly cycle, including during your normal menstrual period. Bleeding after sex or post-menopause would also be considered abnormal.","Symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding

Vaginal bleeding between periods is one symptom of abnormal uterine bleeding. Having extremely heavy bleeding during your period can also be considered abnormal uterine bleeding. Very heavy bleeding during a period and/or bleeding that lasts more than 7 days is called menorrhagia. For example, women may bleed enough to soak through 1 or more tampons or sanitary pads every hour.","A variety of things can cause abnormal uterine bleeding. In most women, abnormal uterine bleeding is caused by a hormonal imbalance. When hormones are the problem, doctors refer to this as dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Abnormal bleeding caused by hormonal imbalance is more common in teenagers or in women who are approaching menopause.

Other common causes of abnormal uterine bleeding are pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or growths in the uterus. These are called polyps or fibroids and can range from small to large growths. Less common causes include an infection, liver, kidney, or thyroid disease, a bleeding disorder, or cancer of the uterus or cervix.

Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but the cause usually depends on your age.

A common cause of abnormal bleeding in teenagers and young adults is pregnancy. Abnormal bleeding can occur in the first few months of a normal pregnancy. Some birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs) can also cause abnormal bleeding.

Abnormal uterine bleeding during a menstrual cycle can occur when your body does not release an egg from your ovaries (called ovulation) as it should. This is common for teenagers who have just started getting their periods. This creates a hormonal imbalance in which the estrogen in your body makes the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium) grow until it gets too thick. When your body gets rid of this lining during your period, the bleeding will be very heavy. A hormonal imbalance may also cause your body not to know when to shed the lining. This can cause irregular bleeding (“spotting”) between your periods.

In the years before menopause and when menopause begins, it is common to have months when you don’t ovulate. This can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, including heavy periods and lighter, irregular bleeding. Thickening of the uterine lining is another cause of bleeding in your 40s and 50s. This thickening can be a warning of uterine cancer. You need to talk to your doctor if you have abnormal uterine bleeding and are in this age group. It may be a normal part of getting older, but it’s important to make sure uterine cancer isn’t the cause.

Hormone replacement therapy is a common cause of uterine bleeding after menopause. Other causes include endometrial and uterine cancer. These cancers are more common in older people than in younger people. But cancer is not always the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. Many other problems can cause bleeding after menopause. For this reason, it’s important to talk to your doctor if you have any bleeding after menopause.","The tests your doctor orders may depend on your age. If you could be pregnant, your doctor will order a pregnancy test. If your bleeding is heavy, your doctor may want to order a blood test. This will make sure you don’t have a low blood count from the blood loss, which could lead to iron deficiency and anemia. An ultrasound exam of your pelvic area shows both the uterus and the ovaries. It may also show the cause of your bleeding. Your doctor may want to do an endometrial biopsy. This is a test of the uterine lining. It’s done by putting a thin plastic tube (called a catheter) into your uterus. Your doctor will use the catheter to remove a tiny piece of the uterine lining. They will send that lining sample to the lab for testing. The test will show if you have cancer or a change in the cells. A biopsy can be done in the doctor’s office and causes only mild pain. Another test is a hysteroscopy. A thin tube with a tiny camera in it is put into your uterus. The camera lets your doctor see the inside of your uterus. If anything abnormal shows up, your doctor can collect tissue for a biopsy","Can abnormal uterine bleeding be prevented or avoided. Most causes of abnormal uterine bleeding are not preventable. However, if a hormonal imbalance is caused by being overweight, losing weight could help. Your weight affects your hormone production. Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent abnormal uterine bleeding in some cases.","There are several treatment options for abnormal bleeding. Your treatment will depend on the cause of your bleeding, your age, and whether you want to get pregnant in the future. Your doctor will help you decide which treatment is right for you. If your doctor decides that a hormone imbalance is causing your abnormal bleeding, you and your doctor may decide to wait and see if the bleeding improves on its own.

Some treatment options include the following:

Birth control pills. Birth control pills contain hormones that can stop the lining of your uterus from getting too thick. They also can help keep your menstrual cycle regular and reduce cramping. Some types of birth control pills, especially the progestin-only pill (also called the “mini-pill”), can cause abnormal bleeding. Let your doctor know if the pill you’re taking doesn’t control your abnormal bleeding.

Intrauterine device (IUD). Your doctor may suggest an IUD. An IUD is a small, plastic device that your doctor inserts into your uterus through your vagina to prevent pregnancy. One type of IUD releases hormones. This type can significantly reduce abnormal bleeding. Like birth control pills, sometimes IUDs can be the cause of abnormal bleeding. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.

Dilation and curettage (D&C). A D&C is a procedure in which the opening of your cervix is stretched so that a surgical tool can be put into your uterus. Your doctor uses this tool to scrape away the lining of your uterus. The removed lining is checked in a lab for abnormal tissue. A D&C is done under general anesthesia (while you’re in a sleep-like state).

If you’re having heavy bleeding, your doctor may perform a D&C both to find out the cause and treat the bleeding. The D&C itself often makes heavy bleeding stop. Your doctor will decide if this procedure is necessary.

Hysterectomy. This type of surgery removes the uterus. If you have a hysterectomy, you won’t have any more periods and you won’t be able to get pregnant. A hysterectomy is major surgery that requires general anesthesia and a hospital stay. It may require a long recovery period. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of a hysterectomy.

Endometrial ablation. This is a surgical procedure that destroys the lining of the uterus. Unlike a hysterectomy, it does not remove the uterus. Endometrial ablation may stop all menstrual bleeding. However, some people will have light menstrual bleeding or spotting after endometrial ablation. In rare cases, you may still have regular menstrual periods after the procedure. After endometrial ablation, you should still use some form of birth control even though, in most cases, pregnancy is not likely after the procedure.

Your doctor can do endometrial ablation in several different ways. Newer endometrial ablation techniques do not require general anesthesia or a hospital stay. The recovery time after this procedure is shorter than the recovery time after a hysterectomy.","Abnormal uterine bleeding can impact your life in a negative way. Not being able to predict when bleeding will begin can cause you to be anxious all the time. Also, heavy menstrual bleeding may limit your daily activities during your period. For some people, it even prevents them from leaving the house.

If you have heavy menstrual bleeding, try taking ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin) during your period (or a few days before you expect your period). Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs can help reduce pain and cramping.

You also should be sure to get enough iron in your diet. Your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement to ensure that you don’t become anemic.","• What is the likely cause of my abnormal uterine bleeding?

• Based on the cause, what treatment options do you recommend?
• What are the risks and benefits of this treatment?
• Will the treatment affect my chances of getting pregnant in the future?

3,Acid Reflux | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/refluxacid-reflux/,"The medical name for this condition is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It’s sometimes called acid reflux or heartburn. Reflux occurs when the acid from the food and liquid in your stomach backs up into your throat (esophagus). It can occur at any age, even in babies. Many times, you or your doctor can determine the triggers for your reflux.","There are several symptoms of reflux, including:

• A burning feeling in the back of the throat, in the middle of the chest, or behind the sternum (breastbone)
• An acid taste in your mouth.
• A dry cough, asthma, and difficulty swallowing (these may occur without the burning sensation)
• Excessive saliva and a sore throat that doesn’t go away

Living with reflux can be miserable if left untreated. Planning and being aware of the triggers for your reflux can help. Make changes in your diet and lifestyle that can improve your quality of life. For example, if you know eating before bedtime causes your reflux, avoid eating late. If you can’t avoid a trigger, plan to take over-the-counter medicine to treat the symptoms of reflux. If you’ve tried all of these things and nothing has helped, see your doctor.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Reflux is caused by a weakened muscle at the end of your throat where it connects to your stomach. The muscle doesn’t close properly, which allows acid to back up into your throat. You can be prone to reflux if you’re pregnant, overweight, taking certain medicines, or smoke.","Your doctor will begin by discussing your symptoms. Not everyone who has an episode of reflux has GERD. Your doctor may have you undergo testing to see if you have GERD. Such tests could include:

• Ambulatory acid (pH) probe test: This test measures the acid in your stomach for 24 hours. Your doctor will insert a small, thin tube into your nose and down into your throat. The tube is connected to a small computer you strap around your waist. Another version of this involves a small probe placed in your throat. The probe transmits a signal for a period of time. After 2 days, the probe falls off and is passed in your stool.
• X-ray: The X-ray will look at the inside your upper digestive system (throat, stomach, and upper intestine). For this test, you will you be given a chalky liquid to swallow. This liquid coats your digestive tract to provide better views of the inside.
• Endoscopy: This is similar to the small, thin tube used for the (pH) test. However, the tube is connected to a small camera at the end. This allows your doctor to look inside your upper digestive tract. He or she may also take a sample of the tissue inside your tract for further testing.
• Esophageal motility test (manometry): This test measures the movement and pressure of your esophagus. It involves inserting small, thin tube through your nose and down your throat.","There are many lifestyle changes you can make to reduce or eliminate reflux, including:

• Not drinking alcohol
• Not eating too close to bedtime
• Losing weight
• Not wearing tight clothing
• Cutting back on foods known to trigger GERD, such as chocolate, caffeine, peppermints, and greasy, spicy, and acidic foods
• Eating smaller meals or avoiding overeating","If your symptoms are mild, treatment may not be necessary. Ask your doctor if he or she recommends taking medicine to relieve symptoms. Over-the-counter medicine is effective for treating mild cases of reflux. These medicines include:

• Antacids: This is a quick-acting medicine that reduces stomach acid. Unfortunately, antacids alone won’t heal the damage stomach acid causes in your esophagus. Sometimes, overusing antacids can cause diarrhea or constipation.
• H-2 receptor blockers: These medicines reduce acid production. They don’t work as quickly as antacids. However, they provide longer relief (up to 12 hours). Stronger versions of these medications are available by prescription from your doctor.
• Proton pump inhibitors: These medicines block acid production and heal the damage in your throat. They are stronger than H-2-receptor blockers.

If these medicines are not providing relief after a few weeks, contact your doctor. Your doctor may give you a prescription version of H-2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors.

Additionally, your doctor may prescribe medicine to strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter. The medicine may decrease the number of times your muscle relaxes. It is often used for severe reflux. Side effects include fatigue or confusion. Another medicine your doctor may prescribe helps your stomach empty faster. This will cause the food to move along the digestive tract and not back up into your throat. Your doctor may combine more than one medicine, depending upon the severity of your reflux.

In some cases, surgery may be required to treat reflux. This is when medicine doesn’t help, or if you want a long-term solution. Types of surgery may include:

• Nissen fundoplication: This surgery reinforces the lower muscle in the esophagus. A surgeon will wrap the very top of the stomach around the outside of the lower esophagus. This reduces reflux by putting pressure on your esophagus. This is a laparoscopic surgery. This means the surgeon makes three or four small cuts in the abdomen (stomach region). He or she will insert instruments, including a flexible tube with a tiny camera, through the cuts.
• Linx surgery: This surgery strengthens the muscle in the esophagus. The Linx device is a ring of tiny beads made of titanium. The surgery wraps the ring around the area between the stomach and esophagus. The magnetic attraction of the beads keeps the opening between the two closed. This helps keep acid from backing up into your throat. However, it’s weak enough to allow food to pass. The surgery is minimally invasive.

4,ACL Injury,https://familydoctor.org/condition/acl-injuries/,"ACL refers to the anterior cruciate ligament. It is 1 of 4 ligaments in your knee. The other knee ligaments are PCL (posterior cruciate ligament), MCL (medial collateral ligament), and LCL (lateral collateral ligament). The ACL is located behind the kneecap (patella). It stabilizes the knee when it rotates. The ACL and PCL connect your thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia).

An ACL injury is the overstretching or tearing of the ACL ligament. A torn ACL is a common knee injury. On average, women are 2 to 8 times more at risk of ACL injuries than men. Teenagers also are getting ACL injuries at an increased rate, probably because more kids are involved in organized sports. The increase in ACL injuries is also due to more awareness and advanced testing.","The primary sign of an ACL injury is a popping noise. This is often combined with pain and swelling. You could experience grinding feelings of your bones or kneecap. Another sign is not being able to put weight on your leg. People with a mild ACL injury might feel like their knee is unstable, or like it might “give out” when they are using it.","ACL injuries often occur in sports or active environments. They usually occur without contact rather than with direct contact. Several things can cause the injury, such as:

• If you are moving and quickly stop or change directions
• If you are still and make a sudden movement (like a jump or turn)
• If you overstretch your knee joint
• If someone hits you in the knee, causing it to move away from the rest of your leg

These things can happen while doing things like skiing, playing soccer or football, or jumping on a trampoline.

When you injure your ACL, it can be a partial or full tear. In a partial tear, only part of the ligament is torn. A full or complete tear happens when the ligament is torn into two pieces. ACL tears usually happen in the middle of the ligament. Sometimes the ligament is pulled completely off the thigh bone. Other injuries can occur at the same time. These include other torn knee ligaments (primarily the MCL, the ligament that gives your knee stability), a torn meniscus (knee cushion), or bone bruises.","If you think you’ve injured your ACL, seek medical attention. Your doctor will perform a knee exam to check your range of motion and the extent of the injury. They may order an X-ray to look for damage to the bones of your knee. If no bone damage is found, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of your knee could confirm an injury to your ACL.","The leading way to prevent injuries such as an ACL tear is to follow a training routine. A physical therapist, athletic trainer, or other sports medicine specialist can help you develop an exercise program that will help reduce your risk of injury. Such a program will usually include:

• Exercises that strengthen leg muscles
• Exercises that strengthen your core (hips, pelvis, and abdomen)
• Techniques and proper knee position when jumping and landing
• Techniques for movements that can lead to injury, such as pivoting or cutting (suddenly slowing down and changing direction)

There is no clear evidence that use of a knee brace prevents ACL injuries. There also is no proof that a knee brace helps more during treatment or physical therapy.","When the injury first happens, you can apply first aid to your knee:

• While lying down, prop up your leg so that it is above the level of your heart.
• Put ice on it.
• Use pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (1 brand name: Advil), to reduce pain and swelling.

After this, you should see your family doctor. Your doctor will weigh several factors to decide on a treatment plan. These include the severity of the injury, your age, your physical condition, your medical history, and other injuries or illnesses you may have.

People who are young, active, and healthy typically have surgery. Your family doctor will refer you to an orthopedic surgeon. In surgery, the ACL will be repaired or reconstructed with tissue. This can come from your hamstring or a minor knee tendon. It can also come from a donor. After surgery, you will need intense physical therapy to rebuild strength in your knee and leg. It can take 8 to 12 months of rehabilitation before an athlete who has ACL surgery can return to their sport.

Another treatment option for people who are aren’t as active or healthy is therapy. This is less intense and invasive. Therapy programs can range anywhere from 10-32 weeks. The goal is to increase movement and strength, and allow the ligament to heal naturally.","Recovering from an ACL injury can be difficult. This is especially true if the injury happened during a daily or regular activity. Keep in mind, your doctor’s goal is to restore your ACL, so treatment is important. Stick to your rehabilitation plan so you heal properly and have the best chance for a full recovery.

There is some evidence that people who have ACL injuries will develop osteoarthritis or degenerative arthritis over time. This outcome is similar regardless of how the injury is treated.","• Why are women and girls more at risk of ACL injuries?
• How long will I have to do physical therapy?
• How long after surgery or therapy until I can play sports or be active again?
• Can I re-injure my ACL? If so, how can I prevent re-injury?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury—aftercare

101,Cystic Fibrosis| Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cystic-fibrosis-cf/,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder (it runs in families) that causes your mucus and sweat glands to behave abnormally. CF causes your mucus to be very thick. This thick, sticky mucus can gather in the lungs and intestines. Over time, it causes permanent damage to these organs.

CF affects all races and ethnic groups but is more common in the white population, especially those with northern European ancestors. As of 2022, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimates that nearly 40,000 children and adults are living with cystic fibrosis in the U.S.

CF is a progressive disease. This means it takes a toll on your body over time. Treatments for CF have improved over the years. This has resulted in a longer life expectancy for those who have CF. Currently, the average life expectancy for a CF patient is mid 40s. However, some patients are living into their 50s.","The symptoms of CF vary from child to child. In most cases, a child will have symptoms before they are a year old. Other times, CF won’t be identified until later — sometimes even not until adulthood.

CF symptoms also vary in severity. One person may have only a few symptoms, while someone else will experience more severe symptoms. Respiratory symptoms are the most common. There are also digestive symptoms and reproductive symptoms. All these symptoms are a result of the thick mucus associated with CF. It blocks air passageways in the lungs. It clogs the digestive system, making it harder for digestive enzymes to pass. In women, a thick cervical mucus may hinder fertility (ability to get pregnant).

Symptoms of CF, as reported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), can include:

• Very salty-tasting skin
• Recurring sinus infections
• Persistent coughing (with or without phlegm)
• Frequent wheezing or shortness of breath
• Frequent lung infections (pneumonia or bronchitis)
• Persistent diarrhea or constipation
• Bulky, foul-smelling greasy stools (poop)
• Poor growth in children even though appetite is good
• Infertility in woman because of thick mucus covering the cervix
• Infertility in men because they are born without a vas deferens (the tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis)

The lifespan of CF patients has increased significantly over the past 3 decades. Thirty years ago, the life expectancy for someone who had CF was less than 20 years. Today, it’s more than twice that (46 years). And some people who have CF live into their 50s.

Living with CF does come with many challenges. Even though treatment options have improved, they are still expensive and can be time consuming. And because care is ongoing (daily), it can become frustrating.

Despite this, most people who have CF are still able to work, go to school, and participate in most typical activities.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","CF is a genetic disorder. This means it is caused by a defect in a gene. Specifically, this defect occurs on the CFTR gene. The CFTR gene is responsible for producing a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body’s cells.

When the CFTR gene is affected, it produces a protein that does not work the way it should. Instead of normal mucus and sweat, the protein causes thick mucus and very salty sweat.","The sweat test is considered the most reliable test for diagnosing CF. If you show symptoms of CF, your doctor will order a sweat test. Or, if a blood test or genetic test suggests that you or your child may have CF, a sweat test is typically used to confirm that diagnosis.

A sweat test is simple and painless. During the test, your doctor will apply a chemical to your arm or leg and use electrical stimulation to encourage your sweat glands to begin sweating. They will collect the sweat and send it to the lab. The lab will measure the amount of chloride in the sweat.

If chloride levels are high, that means the salt levels in the sweat are high. High salt levels confirm a CF diagnosis.

Once you have been diagnosed with CF, there are other tests your doctor may order. These tests can reveal more information about the severity of your CF and how to treat it.

• Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will show if you have scarring in your lungs or swelling of your bronchial tubes. Swelling is a common sign of blockages that can be caused by thick mucus.
• CT scan. A CT scan is primarily used to determine what kind of organ damage CF may have caused.
• Genetic tests. Genetic tests are important because they reveal what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF.
• Sputum test. During this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (mucus that you cough up). This sample can determine whether you have a lung infection. It also will reveal what types of bacteria are causing the infection. This helps your doctor choose an effective antibiotic.","CF is a genetic disorder that cannot be prevented. It is passed along when a child inherits the defective gene from both parents.

A child who inherits the defective gene from only one parent is a carrier. When two carriers have a child, there is a 25% chance their child will have CF; there is a 25% chance their child will not have CF and will not be a carrier; there is a 50% chance their child will be a carrier but not have CF.","There is no cure for CF. The only way to cure or prevent it would involve gene therapy. Researchers continue to explore ways to make this a reality.

Until then, doctors will continue to treat the symptoms of CF to prolong the life expectancy and quality of life for people who have CF. Their treatment plans have improved dramatically over the years.

There are many ways to treat CF because it varies in severity and symptoms. Mostly, treatment plans for CF aim to prevent and control lung infections. With this being the primary goal, much effort is focused on loosening and removing the thick mucus from the lungs.

Respiratory therapy, physical therapy and exercise, combined with medication, helps reduce the mucus in the lungs. If you have CF, there are several medications your doctor may prescribe. These include:

• Doctors prescribe antibiotics to treat lung infections. Antibiotics can wipe out an active infection and prevent future infections.
• Mucus thinners. Doctors prescribe mucus thinners to make it easier for you to cough up mucus and get it out of your lungs. These are inhalable medicines, meaning you breathe them in.
• Doctors prescribe bronchodilators to help open your airways. These medicines are inhaled to relax the muscles around your airways. They make it easier to breathe by increasing airflow.
• Anti-inflammatories. Doctors prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation (swelling) in your airways. This swelling is often caused by ongoing infections. These may be oral medicines (in the form of a pill) or inhalables.

If you have advanced lung disease because of CF, you may also need oxygen therapy as part of your treatment plan.

If your lung disease is severe, a lung transplant may be an option. A lung transplant is a surgical procedure to remove your diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a donor.

CF can cause many digestive problems. These problems are not as serious or life threatening as the lung disease associated with CF.

Doctors can usually manage CF-related digestive problems by prescribing nutritional therapy. This typically will include:

• High-calorie diet that is low-fat and high-protein
• High-calorie shakes that offer extra nutrients
• Pancreatic enzymes, an oral supplement that aids digestion
• Dietary supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K

5,Acne,https://familydoctor.org/condition/acne/,"Acne is a common skin condition. It causes bumps on the skin known as pimples. Pimples form when the tiny hair follicles in your skin are blocked by dead skin and oil. This causes bacteria to grow and irritate the skin. Pimples commonly appear on the face. However, they can appear on the back, chest, arms, and neck. Acne usually starts in your early teen years. It can last into or begin in adulthood. Both boys and girls get it.","• Small, raised, red spots.
• White, fluid-filled tips on the spots.
• Blackheads (looks like pepper in your pores).
• Solid, tender lumps under the skin.","Acne is caused by debris that block the hair follicles in your skin. The debris is made up of dead skin and oil. This blockage allows bacteria to grow in the hair follicles. There are several types of acne:

• Whitehead: The tiny hair follicles in your skin becomes blocked with oil and dead skin. A “whitehead” forms at the tip of each pimple.
• Blackhead: The hair follicle is blocked near the surface of the skin. It turns black when it is exposed to air.
• Cystic acne: This occurs when cysts form deep in the skin around the hair follicle.

Family history contributes to acne. If your parents had bad acne, you may have it too. Your immune system plays a role too. Some people are extra sensitive to the bacteria that get trapped in their hair follicles.","Most of the time, your doctor can diagnose acne by examining the irritation on your skin. He or she will also consider your age, lifestyle, or circumstances. For example, some women get acne when they are pregnant. Some teens and adults get acne from certain foods.","Acne cannot be prevented or avoided. However, some people can reduce the severity by knowing what triggers the irritation. Because boys have more skin oils, they tend to have more severe acne. They have more skin oils. For many people, acne disappears by the age of 25. However, it can continue well into adulthood.

Certain things can trigger or make acne worse:

• Hormonal changes. This happens during puberty, before a woman’s period (menstrual cycle), during pregnancy, or during menopause.
• Certain medicines. This includes supplements or steroids that increase testosterone.
• Makeup (cosmetics), especially oil-based products, suntan lotion, and hair products.
• Stress.
• Picking or squeezing existing pimples.
• Scrubbing your skin too harshly.
• Certain foods, including sugary drinks, white breads and rice, have been shown to increase acne.","Acne can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicines. Your doctor will determine which is best for you.

• Benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. This is the most common treatment. It comes in the form of a lotion, gel, soap, or cleansing pad. It kills the bacteria and dries up the oil. It may take up to 8 weeks to see any improvement. Side effects include additional skin irritation, burning, and redness.

Prescription medicines include:

• Retinoid creams or gels. These are applied to the pimples. Pregnant women should not use certain retinoid products. They can cause birth defects. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. Sun exposure can irritate acne treated with retinoid cream.
• Antibiotics. Certain types of antibiotics can be used with other acne treatments.
• Isotretinoin. This is a strong medicine available under certain brand names. It can cause serious side effects. Talk to your doctor about the side effects.
• Birth control pills. These are sometimes effective for women diagnosed with acne.

Additional treatments are available in your doctor’s office. These include skin peels, skin ablation, and laser or light treatments. These treatments may reduce scarring caused by acne. Small injections of steroid medicines can help treat large acne cysts. Finally, certain lifestyle changes may help. This includes a healthy diet and regular exercise.",Having acne can cause embarrassment and anxiety. Some people may feel overwhelmed by the extra time and effort it adds to your daily hygiene routine. And it may require changes to your diet and lifestyle.,"• Should I clean my face more often?

6,Acute Bronchitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/acute-bronchitis/,"Acute bronchitis is a contagious viral infection that causes inflammation of the bronchial tubes. These are the airways that carry air into your lungs. When these tubes get infected, they swell. Mucus (thick fluid) forms inside them. This narrows the airways, making it harder for you to breathe.

There are 2 types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. Chronic bronchitis is long-lasting and can reoccur. It usually is caused by constant irritation, such as from smoking. Acute bronchitis lasts only a short time. Most cases get better in several days, though the cough can last for several weeks.

When I see patients with chest colds, they usually don’t need antibiotics. Instead, I tell them about some simple treatments they can do at home. Read More","The symptoms of acute bronchitis can include:

• Chest congestion or tightness
• Cough that brings up clear, yellow, or green mucus
• Shortness of breath
• Wheezing
• Sore throat
• Fever
• Chills
• Body aches

Your cough can last for several weeks or more. This happens because the bronchial tubes take a while to heal. A lasting cough may signal another problem, such as asthma or pneumonia.","Acute bronchitis is most often caused by a contagious virus. The same viruses that cause colds can cause this condition. First, the virus affects your nose, sinuses, and throat. Then the infection travels to the lining of the bronchial tubes. As your body fights the virus, swelling occurs and mucus is produced.

You can catch a virus from breathing it in or by skin contact. You are at higher risk of catching the virus if you have close contact with someone who is ill.

Lesser-known causes of acute bronchitis are:

• Bacteria or fungal infections.
• Exposure to irritants, such as smoke, dust, or fumes. You are at greater risk if your bronchial tubes already have damage.
• GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), which causes heartburn. You can get acute bronchitis when stomach acid gets into the bronchial tubes.",Your doctor can confirm acute bronchitis. He or she will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. He or she will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. Your doctor might order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. This will help rule out pneumonia.,"You can help prevent acute bronchitis by staying healthy and avoiding germs. Wash your hands with soap often to kill any contagious viruses.

If you smoke, the best defense against acute bronchitis is to quit. Smoking damages your bronchial tubes and puts you at risk for infection. Smoking also slows down the healing process.

Other steps you can take to avoid acute bronchitis include:

• Wear a mask over your nose and mouth when using lung irritants. These could include paint, paint remover, or varnish.
• Get a flu shot every year.
• Ask your doctor if you should get a pneumonia shot, especially if you are over age 60.","Most cases of acute bronchitis are caused by a virus. This means that antibiotics won’t help. The infection needs to run its course. It almost always goes away on its own. Home treatment focuses on easing the symptoms:

• Drink fluids but avoid caffeine and alcohol.
• Get plenty of rest.
• Take over-the-counter pain relievers to reduce inflammation, ease pain, and lower your fever. These could include acetaminophen (1 brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (1 brand name: Advil). Never give aspirin to a child. It has been linked to Reye syndrome, which can affect the liver and brain.
• Increase the humidity in your home or use a humidifier.

There are some over-the-counter cough medicines that help break up or loosen mucus. Look for the word “guaifenesin” on the label or ask your pharmacist for a suggestion.

Do not hold in a cough that brings up mucus. This type of cough helps clear mucus from your bronchial tubes. If you smoke, you should quit. It will help your bronchial tubes heal faster.

Some people who have acute bronchitis need inhaled medicine. You might need this if you are wheezing. It can help open your bronchial tubes and clear out mucus. You usually take it with an inhaler. An inhaler sprays medicine right into your bronchial tubes. Your doctor will decide if this treatment is right for you.

If your doctor thinks bacteria have caused your acute bronchitis, he or she may give you antibiotics.","Most cases of acute bronchitis go away on their own in 7 to 10 days. You should call your doctor if:

• You continue to wheeze and cough for more than 2 weeks, especially at night when you lie down or when you are active.
• You continue to cough for more than 2 weeks and have a bad-tasting fluid come up into your mouth. This may mean you have GERD. This is a condition in which stomach acid gets into your esophagus.
• Your cough produces blood, you feel weak, you have an ongoing high fever, and you are short of breath. These symptoms may mean you have pneumonia.

The risk of developing complications from acute bronchitis, such as pneumonia, is greater in some people. These include:

• Young children
• The elderly
• People who have asthma
• People who have other health issues (such as cancer or diabetes)
• People who haven’t gotten vaccines for flu, pneumonia, or whooping cough","• What is causing my acute bronchitis?

7,Addison’s Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/addisons-disease/,"Addison’s disease is a condition that affects your body’s adrenal glands. These glands are located on top of your kidneys. They make hormones that affect your mood, growth, metabolism, tissue function, and how your body responds to stress.

Addison’s disease damages those glands. It causes your body to shut down production of the hormones. The disease commonly affects people 30 to 50 years of age. However, it can occur at any age and affects both men and women.","Symptoms appear over a period of several months. They are difficult to diagnose because they are vague. Symptoms include:

• Fatigue
• Muscle weakness
• Joint or muscle pain
• Fever
• Weight loss
• Nausea, vomiting, and or diarrhea (leading to dehydration)
• Headache
• Sweating
• Changes in mood or personality, such as irritability, anxiety, or depression
• Loss of appetite
• Darkening of the skin (called hyperpigmentation)
• Lightheadedness or fainting when standing up, due to low blood pressure
• Cravings for salty food
• Sudden, severe pain in the abdomen (lower stomach), lower back, or legs
• Confusion or slurred speech
• Sluggish movements
• Seizures
• High fever

When symptoms are sudden or quickly get worse, it is called acute adrenal failure. Sometimes it’s called Addisonian crisis. This can lead to death if not treated. If you have any of the following symptoms, get medical help immediately:

• Sudden, intense pain in your lower back, abdomen, or legs
• Severe vomiting and diarrhea (which can lead to dehydration)
• Lower than normal blood pressure
• High levels of potassium and low levels of sodium

What causes Addison’s disease?

Addison’s disease is caused by injury to your adrenal glands. It can also occur when your glands are affected by another medical condition. This is called adrenal insufficiency. There are 2 types of adrenal insufficiency:

Primary adrenal insufficiency: This occurs through damage to your adrenal glands by an autoimmune disease (when your immune system attacks various parts of your body). Other causes of primary adrenal insufficiency include:

• Tuberculosis (or other infections) of the adrenal glands
• Cancer of the adrenal glands
• Bleeding of the adrenal glands

Secondary adrenal insufficiency: This occurs when another condition causes the adrenal glands to stop producing hormones. For example, if there is a problem with your pituitary gland, or you suddenly stop taking a corticosteroid medicine after using it for a long period of time. Corticosteroids are used to treat conditions such as asthma, allergies, arthritis, cancer, and immune system problems.","Addison’s disease is caused by injury to your adrenal glands or when your glands are affected by another medical condition.

Primary adrenal insufficiency: This occurs through damage to your adrenal glands by an autoimmune disease (when your body attacks its own immune system). Other causes of primary adrenal insufficiency include:

• Tuberculosis (or other infections) of the adrenal glands
• Cancer of the adrenal glands
• Bleeding of the adrenal glands

Secondary adrenal insufficiency: This occurs when another condition causes the adrenal glands to stop producing hormones. For example, a problem with your pituitary gland can cause secondary Addison’s disease. Or, you may develop Addison’s disease if you suddenly stop taking a corticosteroid medicine (such as prednisone). Corticosteroids are sometimes prescribed to treat conditions such as asthma, allergies, arthritis, cancer, and immune system problems.","Your doctor will ask you about your medical history and your symptoms. He or she may also perform laboratory tests to determine whether you have Addison’s disease. Those lab tests include:

• Blood tests to measure your body’s hormone and mineral levels. Your doctor may check your blood before and after an injection to see if your body is responding normally to increased levels of certain hormones.
• Computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the size of your adrenal glands or pituitary gland. These scans are similar to an X-ray.",Addison’s disease cannot be prevented or avoided.,"Treating Addison’s disease usually involves taking prescription hormones. This can include hydrocortisone, prednisone, or cortisone acetate. If your body is not making enough of the hormone aldosterone, your doctor may prescribe fludrocortisone. These medicines are taken every day by mouth.

Your doctor may also recommend that you take a medicine called dehydroepiandrosterone. This is a synthetic version of a hormone produced by your body. Some women who have Addison’s disease find that taking this medicine improves their mood and sex drive.

If you are experiencing an Addisonian crisis, you need immediate medical care. The treatment typically consists of injections of hydrocortisone, saline (salt water), and dextrose (sugar). These help restore blood pressure, blood sugar, and potassium levels.","Living with Addison’s disease involves learning to live with the unpleasant symptoms. In addition, you need to prepare for the possibility of Addisonian crisis. This is a medical emergency that requires you to:

• Always carry a medical alert card and bracelet. This gives emergency medical workers information about your condition.
• Keep extra medicine with you in case you forget to take your medicine. Ask your doctor for an injectable form of corticosteroids for use in an emergency.
• Tell your doctor if your symptoms change or if your medicines stop working the way they used to.","• Is Addison’s disease hereditary?
• Can the severity of my symptoms get worse over time?
• Is Addison’s disease rare?
• Can Addison’s disease cause long-term kidney failure?","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Adrenal Insufficiency & Addison’s Disease

8,"ADHD in Children: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Support",https://familydoctor.org/condition/adhd-in-children-symptoms-diagnosis-and-support/,"ADHD is one of the most common developmental disorders of childhood, associated with an ongoing pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity. Symptoms of ADHD can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and school performance. ADHD begins in childhood and can continue into the teen years and adulthood.","Struggling with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity most of the time are the primary symptoms of ADHD in children. Specific symptoms for each include:

• Inability to pay attention to details or making careless mistakes in schoolwork
• Difficulty focusing on tasks or playtime
• Appearing not to listen, even when spoken to
• Difficulty completing instructions, tasks, schoolwork, or chores
• Inability to organize tasks and activities
• Avoiding or disliking anything that requires mental effort, such as homework
• Losing things easily and frequently, such as toys, school assignments, and supplies
• Being easily distracted
• Forgetting to complete daily activities, such as chores, hygiene, and assignments

Hyperactivity and impulsivity.

• Fidgeting or tapping their hands or feet
• Squirming in their chairs or having trouble staying seated for long periods of time
• Constantly on the go or needing constant motion
• Running and climbing in situations where it’s not appropriate
• Difficulty playing or completing a quiet activity
• Talking too much, not knowing when to stop
• Blurting out answers, interrupting
• Difficulty with turn-taking
• Intruding or interrupting in others’ conversations, games, or activities","Despite decades of research, an exact cause of ADHD in children is unknown. However, the strongest research suggests ADHD may be genetic. Research also hints at environmental factors. However, exact factors haven’t been defined.

Certain risk factors do put children at a higher risk for ADHD. They include:

• Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, who has ADHD or another mental health disorder
• Exposure to environmental toxins—such as lead, found mainly in paint and pipes in older buildings
• Maternal drug use, alcohol use, or smoking during pregnancy
• Premature birth

Although many people believe sugar causes hyperactivity, there’s no proof of this. Many issues in childhood can lead to difficulty sustaining attention, but that’s not the same as ADHD.","Thanks to increased physician training and growing parental awareness, children who have ADHD are being diagnosed earlier. When making an ADHD diagnosis, doctors consider whether symptoms have been present before the age of 12. Children up to age 16 are diagnosed with ADHD if they have had at least 6 persistent symptoms of inattention and/or 6 persistent symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity present for at least 6 months. Symptoms must be present in two or more settings. For example, the symptom occurs at home or school or with friends or relatives and interferes with the quality of social or school functioning.

Talk to your doctor if you think your child has symptoms of ADHD. Although your primary care doctor can likely diagnose and treat ADHD, they may also refer you to a developmental pediatrician or a mental health professional. These may include a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, who can do a thorough evaluation and make an ADHD diagnosis.

During an evaluation, your doctor or mental health professional may:

• Review your child’s mental health and medical history
• Ask to speak with family members, teachers, and other adults who know the child well and see them in different settings
• Look at checklists and administer tests designed to diagnose ADHD

There are standardized behavior rating scales or ADHD symptom checklists to determine whether a child or teen meets the criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. Although there is no single ADHD test, multiple psychological tests can look at working memory, executive functioning (abilities such as planning and decision-making), visual and spatial skills, or reasoning skills. These tests can detect psychological or cognitive (brain) strengths and challenges as well as identify or rule out possible learning disabilities.",null,"There is no cure for ADHD. However, most children who have been diagnosed with ADHD are treated with a combination of prescription medicine, psychological and psychosocial behavioral therapy. They also may participate school-based programs that embrace ADHD-friendly classroom strategies, parent, and school support. Each is dependent on a child’s needs and symptoms.

The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD are “stimulants.” Historically, these medications have been effective. However, as with any medication, there can be side effects. If your child is taking ADHD prescription medicine, they must be monitored by their doctor at regular intervals to check for the appropriate dosage and any side effects. Nonstimulant medications are also available. Sometimes doctors will prescribe antidepressants to treat children with ADHD. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved these medications for treating ADHD. In many cases, a person diagnosed with ADHD must try several different medications or dosages before finding what works for them.

Unlike specific psychotherapy and medication treatments that are scientifically proven to improve ADHD symptoms, complementary health approaches for ADHD, such as natural products, do not qualify as evidence-supported interventions. For more information, visit the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website.

Thanks to growing awareness and treatment approaches, there are many tools available for parenting a child with ADHD today. Primary care doctors, as well as mental health professionals, have become experienced in combining prescription medicine and behavioral therapy to help a child be successful in school, at home, and with peers. Similarly, most schools are equipped with ADHD-friendly classrooms and strategies to assist. Often, these strategies are good for all students, including taking breaks to get up out of their chairs and stretch or move.

It’s important for parents to share with the school administration, teaching staff, and school nurse if their child has ADHD. This enables a discussion of medicine and strategies. It’s also important to look for local parent support groups to share your journey. You may find a tip of nugget of information that will help in your journey.

Also, talk to your mental health professional about coping strategies for your child. ADHD isn’t just a challenge for parents, it is frustrating to the child as well. Learning to recognize their own stresses and how to cope with them can help.",null,"• How do I know if my child has ADHD?

Trends that appear on TikTok and other platforms can potentially do more harm than good. Aways rely on medical professionals. Also, learn to separate fact from fiction. Some of the ADHD myths that often circulate include:

• Only boys can have ADHD
• Too much sugar causes ADHD
• ADHD is caused by poor parenting
• ADHD only affects children and will go away when they grow up

Remember, too, that ADHD can coexist and/or be confused with other conditions such as anxiety and depression.

13,Allergic Conjunctivitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/allergic-conjunctivitis/,"Allergic conjunctivitis is a common cause of “pink eye.” It occurs when the clear, thin, membrane (conjunctiva) that covers your eyeball becomes swollen and irritated.","The most common symptom is a red, swollen eye. Additional symptoms may include pain, and itchy, watery eyes. Allergic conjunctivitis can affect both eyes.","Pink eye is caused by bacteria, viruses, or allergens. When allergies are the cause, it is known as allergic conjunctivitis. Some common allergens include:

• Pollen from trees, grass, and ragweed
• Animal saliva or dander (tiny particles of skin shed by animals)
• Perfumes
• Cosmetics (makeup)
• Skin medicines
• Air pollution
• Smoke","To diagnose allergic conjunctivitis, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and health history. He or she will examine your eye. If your doctor sees the irritation is severe, they may swab the corners of your eye to send a sample of the liquid to a lab. If your doctor determines allergies are to blame, they may suggest you undergo allergy testing.","You can reduce your risk of allergic conjunctivitis by avoiding things that irritate your eyes. For example, if you’re allergic to pollen that comes from grass and trees, limit your exposure outdoors. Check weather reports for pollen and mold levels. Keep your doors and windows closed. Use an air conditioner during the summer months. Also consider using an air purifier in your house.

If you’re allergic to animals, consider not having a pet. If you’re around a pet, avoid touching the animal and then touching your eyes. Always wash your hands and body after exposure to allergens.","There are many ways to treat the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Some treatments include:

• Tilting your head back, close your eyes, and apply a cold, damp washcloth over your eyes.
• Taking an antihistamine. This is medicine many people take for allergies.
• Putting lubricating eye drops (sometimes called artificial tears) in your eyes.

You can buy many antihistamine pills and lubricating eye drops without a prescription.

Along with lubricating eye drops, other types of eye drops can help allergic conjunctivitis. Some contain medicine. These medicines may include an antihistamine, a decongestant, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or a mast cell stabilizer. Some drops contain a combination of these medicines. Some of these eye drops require a prescription.

As with all medicines, eye drops may cause side effects. You may experience burning and stinging when you first put the drops in. This usually goes away in a few minutes.

Talk with your doctor about which treatment is right for you.","Living with this condition can make you feel miserable for days at a time. It can affect your attention and productivity at school and work. Unfortunately, it can also interfere with fun and recreation. It can be a repeat problem if not treated or avoided. Therefore, it’s important to find out which allergens cause your conjunctivitis. Once you know what causes it, it’s important to avoid those things that may trigger the irritation.

Also, if you wear contact lenses, avoid wearing them while your eye is irritated. The contacts may cause the conjunctivitis to get worse. Wear your glasses until your eyes feel better.","• How do I know whether a virus, bacteria, or allergen is causing my symptoms?

9,Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder),https://familydoctor.org/condition/adhesive-capsulitis/,"Adhesive capsulitis is commonly called frozen shoulder. This occurs when the joints in your shoulder are inflamed. The inflammation leads to scar tissue. This prevents you from being able to move your shoulder in all directions without pain. Your shoulder can become stiff, and it may be difficult for you to move it at all.","The primary symptom is difficulty moving your shoulder without pain and stiffness. You may feel this when you:

• Reach up toward the sky with both arms.
• Reach your arms out straight in front of you.
• Raise your arms out to the sides of your body.
• Try to unzip the back of your dress or pull your wallet from the back pocket of your pants.

At first, your shoulder may ache and feel stiff. Then it may get very painful. This is called the painful stage. It may last about 3 to 8 months. The second stage is called the adhesive stage. You may not have as much pain. However, your shoulder keeps getting stiffer. This stage usually lasts about 4 to 12 months. By the time you reach the final stage, it becomes very hard to move your shoulder, even a little bit. This stage usually lasts about 1 to 3 months. However, it isn’t very painful. Eventually, the stiffness slowly goes away. You can move your shoulder again. You may not get the full movement of your shoulder back. As your shoulder movement increases, you may still have pain at times. However, you should be able to do more activities.","This condition develops when the tissue in your shoulder joint tightens and restricts movement. This occurs when you are not active because of another injury, such as a rotator cuff injury, broken arm, or recovering from a surgery. Also, it happens when you use your shoulder the wrong way. Certain risks factors can increase frozen shoulder. Risks are higher for:

• People 40 years of age and older.
• Women.
• People with diabetes.
• People with thyroid problems.
• People experiencing hormonal changes (more likely during menopause).
• People who have had open-heart surgery.
• People with cervical disk disease of the neck.","Your doctor may be able diagnose frozen shoulder just by talking to you about your symptoms and watching you move your shoulder. During an exam, your doctor may press on parts of your shoulder to see what might be causing the pain. Your doctor may also want to take an X-ray or do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your shoulder to look for other problems.","Frozen shoulder can’t be prevented or avoided. However, you can reduce your risks. A person with diabetes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related illness by following his or her doctor’s lifestyle and prescription medicine advice. If you are having surgery, see a physical therapist and follow his or her post-surgery shoulder exercises. If you have any shoulder discomfort, see your doctor earlier rather than later. This may prevent serious pain and damage.","Your doctor can teach you physical therapy exercises to help break up the scar tissue in your shoulder. They may refer you to a physical therapist to show you how to do the exercises. Many of the exercises can be done at home.

Sometimes the exercises hurt. Your doctor may give you something for the pain or to relax your muscles. This might include over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medications, and/or steroid injections in your shoulder. Putting a heating pad or an ice pack on your shoulder for a few minutes before you do the exercise may help. Remember to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before starting your exercises. Warm up by doing very gentle exercises and small movements with your shoulder. Warm up and stretch other parts of your body (neck, back, hands, and elbows), too.

Treating the underlying reason for frozen shoulder might be necessary. Surgery may be required if other treatments are not effective. The surgical procedure is called shoulder arthroscopy. It removes scar tissue. The surgery is done under anesthesia. That means medicine is injected into your vein prior to surgery to make you sleep and numb to pain. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments from the scar tissue.","Living with frozen shoulder requires planning and maybe pain medicine. For example, you may have to avoid certain tasks or movement that you know will cause you shoulder pain. You may have to do daily physical therapy exercises. And you may have to follow your doctor’s advice for over-the-counter and prescription medicines.","• How do I know if my shoulder pain is temporary or frozen shoulder?

10,Adult ADHD,https://familydoctor.org/condition/adult-adhd/,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder represented by a group of behaviors. It used to be called attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADHD is not just present in children. Adults can be diagnosed with ADHD, too. As such, it is a disorder that is considered to affect a person across the lifespan. It is more common in adult men. People who have ADHD have trouble paying attention (executive function) at school, work, or home. Even when they try to concentrate, they find it hard to pay attention. It can interfere with relationships to a degree.","Adults who have ADHD are more likely to be distracted, careless, or impulsive. Someone who finds it difficult to pay attention may have adult ADHD if they have 6 or more of the following symptoms:

• Has difficulty following instructions
• Has difficulty focusing on activities at school, work, and/or home
• Moves from one thing to another, sometimes without completing the first
• Loses things often
• Appears not to listen
• Doesn’t pay close attention to details
• Seems disorganized
• Has trouble with tasks that require planning ahead
• Forgets things
• Is easily distracted

Someone who is impulsive may have adult ADHD if they have the following symptoms.

• Makes decisions quickly, often without thinking them through
• Interrupts people
• Talks too much
• Fidgets or can’t be still
• Is always on the go
• Is impatient or has trouble waiting their turn","People who have ADHD do not make enough chemicals in certain parts of the brain that help organize thoughts. This is thought to be the cause of ADHD. The shortage of chemicals may be due to a person’s genes. Research shows that ADHD is more common in people who have a close family member with the disorder.

Recent research suggests there are certain risk factors for ADHD, including:

• Smoking during pregnancy
• Substance abuse during pregnancy
• Exposure to environmental toxins (lead)
• Brain injury
• Low birth weight
• Genetics","A person diagnosed with ADHD will have had symptoms for at least 6 months. You may have been diagnosed with ADHD as a child, or it may have gone undiagnosed. Some adults who have ADHD may be diagnosed when they find out their children have ADHD.

Talk to your doctor if you notice ongoing signs of adult ADHD. They will discuss your symptoms, lifestyle, and overall health. In order to be diagnosed with adult ADHD, you must have had symptoms prior to age 12.","You cannot prevent or avoid adult ADHD.

It is important to make some personal changes to help improve your condition. These may include:

• Setting a schedule and sticking to it. Having a set schedule can keep you organized, focused, and on track.
• Thinking before you act. If you know you tend to be impulsive, try to put more thought into decisions. Think about pros and cons as well as possible risks or consequences. Think about how it could affect others, not just yourself.
• Maintaining a healthy, well-rounded routine. Try to be consistent with your diet, exercise, and sleep. Avoid substances or situations that trigger negative actions.","Adults who have ADHD can help manage symptoms. Start by identifying the areas of your life that are most impaired by ADHD and then seek treatment to address them. Treatment options include medicine, therapy, and/or lifestyle changes.

If your doctor thinks you have adult ADHD, they may suggest therapy. This could include individual counseling and/or support groups. Your doctor also may recommend testing and counseling with someone who specializes in treating ADHD. You can learn ways to change your work environment and keep distractions to a minimum. Organizational tools can help you learn how to focus on activities at work and at home. Many people who have ADHD find counseling helpful.","People who have ADHD should visit their doctor for regular checkups. A lifetime of ADHD behaviors can cause social problems, such as low self-esteem, trouble learning or working, and problems with relationships. ADHD can put you at risk of addiction. Some people who have ADHD may have problems sleeping or eating. They may have related health conditions as well (which can be mistaken for adult ADHD). These could include:

• Anxiety
• Depression
• Bipolar disorder
• Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)
• Tourette syndrome
• Learning disabilities
• Substance abuse","• If I am diagnosed with ADHD as a child, will I have it as an adult?
• What medicine is best for me? What are its side effects?
• Will I always have to take medicine?
• Do I have to take the medicine consistently for it to work?
• Are there diet or lifestyle changes I can make to help with ADHD?
• Can counseling help with relationship issues?","Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD): For Adults National Institute of Mental Health: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","One type of medicine used to treat ADHD is called psychostimulants. This includes methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and a drug that combines dextroamphetamine and amphetamine. These medicines have a stimulating effect in most people. However, they have a calming effect in people who have ADHD. These medicines improve attention and concentration and decrease impulsive and overactive behaviors. Your doctor may consider other non-stimulant medicines, such as atomoxetine, clonidine, desipramine, imipramine, or bupropion.

All medicines have side effects. Psychostimulants may decrease your appetite and cause a stomachache or a headache. The loss of appetite can cause unplanned weight loss in some people. This side effect seems to be more common in children. Some people have insomnia (trouble sleeping). Other possible side effects include fast heartbeat, chest pain, or vomiting. To avoid or reduce the side effects of psychostimulants, follow these tips:

• Use the lowest possible dose that still controls the hyperactivity or inattention. Your doctor will tell you the right dose.
• Take the medicine with food if it bothers your stomach.
• Maintain a healthy diet.
• Ask your doctor if you can skip taking medicine on the weekends.
• If you take a long-acting medicine, do not crush, break, or chew it before swallowing it.

It’s important to take the medicine the way your doctor prescribes it. Follow their advice, even if you think the medicine isn’t working. Medicines used to treat ADHD have been shown to improve a person’s ability to do specific tasks. This includes paying attention or having more self-control. The length of time a person will need to take medicine depends on each person. Some people only need to take medicine for 1 to 2 years. Others need treatment for longer."
11,AIDS | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/aids/,"Understanding AIDS symptoms and treatment is important for managing this advanced stage of HIV. AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, happens when HIV weakens the immune system over time, making it harder for the body to fight infections. With early diagnosis and proper treatment, many people living with HIV can avoid developing AIDS—or manage it more effectively if it occurs.

AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the last stage of the life-threatening human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that makes your body’s cells unable to fight off infections. Having it makes you more susceptible to the serious consequences of infections and other diseases. Essentially, AIDS attacks your body’s immune system, killing CD4 cells (also called T cells). If HIV is left untreated, it will continue to kill off CD4 cells your body needs to fight off infections. When this happens, it is considered stage 3 HIV, or AIDS.

It is important to note that treatment options have come a long way for HIV/AIDS, making it more of a chronic disease than a fatal one. However, once you have been diagnosed with HIV, you cannot cure it. It requires a lifetime of management.","AIDS symptoms are triggered by the body’s weakened immune system. This means that if you have AIDS, your body can’t fight off infections and other conditions. People who have AIDS are at high risk of getting opportunistic infections. These infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc. They can affect any part of the body. AIDS also puts you at higher risk for certain cancers, especially lymphomas, skin cancer, and cervical cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health.

AIDS symptoms will vary, but may include:

• Lung infections (cough, fever, and shortness of breath)
• Intestinal infections (diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting)
• Extreme tiredness
• Swollen lymph glands
• Mouth sores
• Fever
• Sweats
• Rashes or skin lesions
• Weight loss","AIDS is caused by HIV, a virus. HIV is spread from person to person several ways. You can get HIV by having sexual contact with a person who has HIV. You can also get it if you share a needle with someone who has HIV. Pregnant mothers who have HIV may pass it to their babies during pregnancy, childbirth, or while breastfeeding.","When you have HIV, your doctor will monitor your CD4 count by ordering a blood test. A healthy CD4 count ranges from 500 to 1,600 CD4 cells. The lower your CD4 count, the less your body can fight infection. If your CD4 count drops below 200, your doctor may diagnose you with AIDS. Many times, you will also already have an infection or pneumonia due to the low number of CD4 cells.","You can prevent AIDS by preventing HIV. The best way to prevent HIV is to not have sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with a person who has HIV, or share a needle with a person who has HIV.

Other ways to prevent HIV include:

• Use a condom when you have sex. The best condom is a male latex condom. A female condom isn’t as effective but does offer some protection.
• Don’t share needles and syringes.
• Never let someone else’s blood, semen, urine, vaginal fluid, or feces get into your anus, vagina, or mouth.","Even though there is no cure for HIV, there are many medicines available to help combat it. These medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) will often prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. Even when HIV does progress to AIDS, ART is often still effective. However, it’s most effective the earlier you begin treatment.

One HIV preventive medicine is known as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). This is a medicine for people who are at high risk of contracting HIV from sex or drug use. When taken as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective for preventing HIV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Another HIV medicine, known as PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is effective when taken 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV. It is designed to prevent the virus from taking hold. However, when taking both these medicines, the virus can still be transmitted through sex and drug use.","Without treatment, the survival rate for someone with AIDS is about 3 years. That number decreases if they get an infection or cancer as a result of their weakened immune system.

With treatment, though, the survival rate for HIV and even AIDS is much better. In the United States, most people with HIV don’t develop AIDS because effective ART stops disease progression.","• When should I begin taking antiretroviral medicine?

12,Alcohol Misuse,https://familydoctor.org/condition/alcohol-abuse/,"Alcohol misuse is a serious problem. It is a pattern of drinking too much alcohol too often. It interferes with your daily life. You may be suffering from alcohol misuse if you drink too much alcohol at one time or too often throughout the week. It is also a problem if drinking harms your relationships. It can cause you to be unable to function at work and in other areas of your life.

Alcohol misuse can lead to alcoholism­­­—a physical dependency on alcohol. Too much alcohol at one time also can lead to alcohol poisoning. One alcoholic drink is defined as a 12-ounce bottle of beer; a 5-ounce glass of wine; or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits (such as whiskey, rum, or tequila).

You are misusing alcohol when:

• You drink 8 drinks per week or more than 4 drinks per occasion (for women).
• You drink more than 15 drinks per week or more than 5 drinks per occasion (for men).
• You have more than 7 drinks per week or more than 3 drinks per occasion (for men and women older than 65).
• Consuming these amounts of alcohol harms your health, relationships, work, and/or causes legal problems.","You may be misusing alcohol if:

• You have tried stopping using alcohol for a week or more but can’t make it past a few days.
• You can’t stop drinking once you start.
• You recognize you need to stop or cut back.
• You are unable to perform at work or home when you are drinking.
• You feel guilty after drinking.
• Others are telling you that you have a problem.
• You feel annoyed by criticism of your drinking.
• You have a drink in the morning to get yourself going after drinking too much the night before.
• You have physically hurt someone else or yourself after drinking too much. This could be due to accidents or violence.
• You hide your drinking or your alcohol.
• You have blackouts and memory lapses after drinking too much.
• You are depressed.
• You are getting traffic or driving tickets while under the influence of alcohol.
• Your drinking is interfering with your relationships.
• Your hands are shaking.

Alcohol affects your health in other ways, too. It can cause cirrhosis, a disease of the liver. It’s a significant cause of deaths and injuries because of accidents. It can damage your baby’s health if you drink alcohol during pregnancy. It can cause a bleeding ulcer and irritate the lining of your stomach. Alcohol also can cause you to gain weight, feel sick or dizzy, cause you to have bad breath, and make your skin break out.","People misuse alcohol for many reasons. It may be due to social pressure, a desire to relax, a coping mechanism for anxiety, depression, tension, loneliness, self-doubt or unhappiness, or a family history of misusing alcohol.","Many people who are misusing alcohol will hear from family and friends that they have a problem. Generally, doctors believe a person is misusing alcohol when:

• Drinking interferes with your responsibilities at work, home, or school.
• Drinking puts you or someone else in physical danger (driving, operating machinery, mixing alcohol and medicine, drinking alcohol while pregnant).
• It leads to legal problems.
• It harms your relationships.","If you have a family history of alcoholism or alcohol misuse, you may have to work harder at resisting or limiting alcohol. Other ways to reduce your alcohol consumption:

• Limit yourself to one drink when by yourself or with friends.
• Seek treatment for underlying mental health conditions.
• Avoid spending time with others who abuse alcohol.
• Talk to your doctor.
• Consider joining a support group made up of others facing the same challenge.

Your doctor may screen for alcohol misuse. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends screening adults aged 18 years or older for alcohol misuse. Also, AAFP recommends teaching teens between 12 and 17 years old to avoid alcohol.","If you are the one suffering from alcohol misuse, the first step is recognizing you need help. Many studies show that people struggling with alcohol misuse can benefit from some form of treatment. However, everyone is different. Not all treatments work the same for every person. The sooner a person seeks treatment, the better the outcome.

Behavioral therapy can be used to treat alcohol misuse. It can take the form of support groups, counseling, or a combination of the two. Some prescription medicines can treat alcohol misuse by helping people stop or reduce their drinking. As with all medicines, some might cause side effects.

Once you have found a treatment that is effective for you, it’s important to stick to that treatment. Also, it’s helpful to avoid situations that involve a lot of alcohol.","Living with alcohol misuse means recognizing the triggers that make you want to drink. For example, hanging around with others who drink will make it difficult for you. You may be experiencing stress or unhappiness in your life and don’t have a counselor or friend to talk with. This could cause you to turn to alcohol to help you cope.

Living with alcohol misuse will continue to be a struggle if you do not recognize that you need help. You will continue to jeopardize your safety, your job or school, and your relationships.","• Can alcohol misuse begin when you are elderly?
• Will prescription medicines used for alcohol misuse interact with other medicines I take for my health?
• Can I take antidepressant medicine while being treated for alcohol misuse?
• Can I drink occasionally if I am suffering from alcohol misuse and can stop after one drink?
• What are the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Alcohol & Substance Misuse

398,Sleepwalking,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sleepwalking/,"Sleepwalking is just as it sounds. It involves walking around, sitting up, or doing other activities while asleep. The person’s eyes are open. They look like they are awake. Sleepwalking occurs during deep sleep. It happens early in the night during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Usually, a person has no memory of it. Sleepwalking is more common in children and young adults. This is because older people don’t experience deep sleep as often. Some of the things people do while sleepwalking, include:

• Talking or mumbling, incoherently.
• Getting dressed.
• Preparing food.
• Moving furniture.
• Going to the bathroom.
• Driving a car (this is rare).

Sleepwalking can last a few seconds to 30 minutes. It could last longer. The average sleepwalking episode lasts 10 minutes. While sleepwalking, a person may look confused or dazed. If you talk to the person during the episode, he or she will not respond.

Sleepwalking isn’t as worrisome as you may think. A person’s safety is the biggest concern. And sleepwalking rarely involves unsafe behavior.

Talk to a doctor if sleepwalking is chronic. Tell your doctor if it causes fatigue during the day or attention problems. Typically, there are no exams or tests for sleepwalking. If your doctor is concerned, he or she may look into other medical causes. This might include seizures. He or she also may look at a person’s emotional history.

If the problem is chronic, your doctor may discuss medicines to treat it. He or she also may recommend keeping a sleep diary. This would be helpful in tracking episodes.

It is a myth that you should not wake a sleepwalker. It is okay to do so. The person will seem confused and will not recall what just happened.

Frequent sleepwalking can be reduced by:

• Avoiding alcohol or anti-depressant medicine. Talk to your doctor about alternatives.
• Keeping your sleep routine. Go to bed at the same time every night. Don’t skimp on sleep. Get at least 7 hours of sleep each night. If you suffer from insomnia (difficulty sleeping), this effects your sleep quality. Talk to your doctor about insomnia.
• Reducing stress, anxiety, and conflict. These things can worsen the condition.

Safety is the biggest concern for sleepwalkers. Doing these things may help keep a sleepwalker safe.

• Keep a sleepwalker’s environment free from clutter. Move furniture and electrical cords out of the way. This will reduce trips and falls.
• Keep doors and windows locked.
• Consider moving a sleepwalker to a safer bedroom if necessary.

14,Allergic Rhinitis (Allergies),https://familydoctor.org/condition/allergic-rhinitis/,"Allergic rhinitis is the medical term for hay fever or nasal allergies. By definition, allergic rhinitis is swelling of the nasal passages caused by allergens. It’s important to note that while many people refer to it as hay fever, it is not caused by hay. Nor does is cause a fever. Allergic rhinitis is triggered by having allergies. You have an allergy when your body overreacts to things that don’t cause problems for most people. These things are called allergens.

There are 2 forms of allergic rhinitis:

• Seasonal (hay fever):Caused by an allergy to pollen and/or mold spores in the air. Pollen is the fine powder that comes from flowering plants. It can be carried through the air and is easily inhaled. Symptoms are seasonal and usually occur in spring, late summer, and fall. This is the most common form of allergy.
• Perennial:Caused by other allergens such as dust mites, pet hair or dander, or mold. Symptoms occur year-round.","Your symptoms can vary, depending on the severity of your allergies. Symptoms can include:

• Sneezing
• Coughing
• Itching (mostly eyes, nose, mouth, throat and skin)
• Runny nose
• Stuffy nose
• Headache
• Pressure in the nose and cheeks
• Ear fullness and popping
• Sore throat
• Watery, red, or swollen eyes
• Dark circles under your eyes
• Trouble smelling

Allergic rhinitis can last several weeks, longer than a cold or the flu. It does not cause fever. The nasal discharge is thin, watery, and clear. Nasal discharge from a cold or the flu tends to be thicker. Itching (mostly in the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, and skin) is common with hay fever but not with a cold or the flu. Sneezing occurs more with hay fever. You may even have severe sneeze attacks.","If you have allergies, your body releases chemicals when you are exposed to an allergen. One such chemical is called histamine. Histamine is your body’s defense against the allergen. The release of histamine causes your symptoms.

Hay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen. Pollen comes from flowering trees, grass, and weeds. If you are allergic to pollen, you will notice your symptoms are worse on hot, dry days when wind carries the pollen. On rainy days, pollen often is washed to the ground, which means you are less likely to breathe it. Your allergies can vary depending on the time of year:

• Allergies that occur in the spring (late April and May) are often due to tree pollen.
• Allergies that occur in the summer (late May to mid-July) are often due to grass and weed pollen.
• Allergies that occur in the fall (late August to the first frost) are often due to ragweed.

Allergens that can cause perennial allergic rhinitis include:

• Mold is common where water tends to collect, such as shower curtains and damp basements. It can also be found in rotting logs, hay, and mulch. This allergy is usually worse during humid and rainy weather.
• Animal dander.The skin, saliva, and urine of furry pets such as cats and dogs are allergens. You can be exposed to dander when handling an animal or from house dust that contains dander.
• Many allergens, including dust mites, are in dust. Dust mites are tiny living creatures found in bedding, mattresses, carpeting, and upholstered furniture. They live on dead skin cells and other things found in house dust.","If your symptoms interfere with your daily life, see your family doctor. Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history and perform a physical exam. Keeping a record of your symptoms over a period of time can help your doctor determine what triggers your allergies.

Your doctor may want to do an allergy skin test to determine what you are allergic to. Tiny amounts of allergens are applied to your skin. You will feel tiny pricks that are usually not painful. Your doctor will observe and record the way your skin reacts to each allergen.

Your doctor may also decide to do a blood test, such as the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). This test identifies antibodies in your blood that determine what you’re allergic to. Once your allergens are identified, you and your doctor can decide the best treatment.","Allergic rhinitis cannot be prevented. You can help your symptoms by avoiding the things that cause your symptoms.

• Keep windows closed. This is especially important during high-pollen seasons.
• Wash your hands after petting animals.
• Use dust- and mite-proof bedding and mattress covers.
• Wear glasses outside to protect your eyes.
• Shower before bed to wash off allergens from hair and skin.

You can also avoid things that can make your symptoms worse, such as:

• Aerosol sprays
• Air pollution
• Cold temperatures
• Humidity
• Irritating fumes
• Tobacco smoke
• Wood smoke","Several medicines can be used to treat allergies. Nasal steroids are often the most effective treatment. Your doctor will help you determine what medicine is best for you depending on your symptoms, age, and overall health. If you are pregnant, your doctor will advise what medications are safe for you to take. Some allergy symptoms during pregnancy are a naturally occurring part of being pregnant and not allergic rhinitis.

These medicines help prevent symptoms if you use them regularly, before you’re exposed to allergens:

• Nasal steroid spraysreduce the reaction of the nasal tissues to inhaled allergens. This helps relieve the swelling in your nose so that you feel less stopped-up. They are the most effective at treating patients who have chronic symptoms. Many nasal steroids are now available without a prescription. You won’t notice their benefits for up to 2 weeks after starting them.
• Antihistamineshelp reduce the sneezing, runny nose, and itchiness of allergies. These come in pill form and as nasal sprays. Many are available over the counter. Some require a prescription.
• Decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, temporarily relieve the stuffy nose of allergies. Decongestants are found in many medicines and come as pills, nose sprays, and nose drops. They are best used only for a short time. Nose sprays and drops shouldn’t be used for more than 3 days because you can become dependent on them. This causes you to feel even more stopped-up when you try to quit using them. You can buy decongestants without a doctor’s prescription. However, they can raise your blood pressure. Talk your family doctor before using them if you have high blood pressure.
• Leukotriene inhibitors are prescription pills that help block leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are another class of chemicals that the body releases when exposed to allergens.
• Cromolyn sodiumis a nasal spray that helps prevent the body’s reaction to allergens. This medicine may take 2 to 4 weeks to start working. It is available without a prescription.
• Eye drops. If your other medicines are not helping enough with your itchy, watery eyes, your doctor may prescribe eye drops for you. Some are available over the counter.
• Allergy shots or sublingual tablets(also called immunotherapy) are an option for people who try other treatments but still have allergy symptoms. These shots or dissolvable tablets contain a very small amount of the allergen you are allergic to. They’re given on a regular schedule so that your body gets used to the allergens. This helps decrease your body’s sensitivity to the allergens. Over time, your allergy symptoms will become less severe.","Living with the symptoms of allergic rhinitis can affect your daily life. Nasal symptoms can be worse when lying down. This can disturb your ability to sleep well. Fatigue and headaches can affect your ability to function at school and work.

There is also a link between asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis. Therefore, getting good control of allergic rhinitis is crucial for maintaining good control of asthma.

There are many medicines and treatments that can help you manage your symptoms. Talk to your doctor as soon as you feel that your symptoms are getting worse or are not easy to control. Your doctor can help you come up with the right plan to control allergies so they don’t affect your ability to live your normal life.","• Could anything else, such as a cold or the flu, be causing my symptoms?
• How do I figure out what I’m allergic to?
• Is my allergy seasonal?
• I am allergic to _____. Am I at risk for any other allergies?
• What changes can I make at home to relieve my symptoms?
• Will any over-the counter medicines relieve my symptoms?
• What should I do if my symptoms get worse or don’t respond to the treatment you’ve prescribed?

15,Alopecia Areata (AA),https://familydoctor.org/condition/alopecia-areata/,"Alopecia areata is a form of alopecia (hair loss). It’s a non-life-threatening disease of your immune system that affects the hair on your scalp. With this condition, your body mistakenly views your hair follicles as an enemy. Your body attacks the hair follicles. This causes some or all of your hair to fall out. It usually begins with the hair on your head. There are three severe forms of alopecia, including:

• Areata (patchy hair loss on your head)
• Totalis (complete hair loss on your head)
• Universalis (the loss of all body hair)

Alopecia is not contagious. It occurs in people of all ages. However, it is more common in children and adults in their early 20s.

Alopecia is different than telogen effluvian, which is hair loss that can be caused by physical stress such as rapid weight loss or pregnancy. Telogen effluvian is more common and usually, your hair does grow back after this type of hair loss.","The main symptom of alopecia areata is hair loss that occurs in small, round patches on your head. This leaves smooth, peach-colored areas of scalp exposed. A mild case of alopecia areata starts with one to two coin-size hairless patches. In many instances, it stops after that. Sometimes, the hair will grow back. However, there’s no guarantee. The condition is unpredictable, and the cycle of hair loss and regrowth can repeat itself.

Alopecia areata can grow into another form of alopecia. In its worst form, alopecia universalis causes you to lose all body hair. This includes eyebrows, eyelashes, arms, legs, underarms, pubic, and chest and back hair for men. Rarely, people who have alopecia may feel burning or itching in the areas where they once had hair.

Some people with alopecia areata see changes in their fingernails and toenails. Nails can have tiny dents (pitting), have white spots or lines, and be rough.","There is no known cause for alopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease. This means your immune system attacks part of your body by mistake. Scientists think the cause of the disease may be related to a person’s genes. In that case, they believe a virus or something in your environment may trigger the disease.","See your doctor if you are experiencing significant hair loss. There are many reasons for hair loss. Your doctor will look at your hair loss pattern. He or she will review your medical history. They will check to see if the hairless areas of your scalp are smooth and peach-colored. Sometimes, the remaining hair in alopecia areata has a specific shape. Your doctor may pull a couple of hairs from your head to examine under a microscope. If your doctor can’t confirm a diagnosis, he may send you to a lab for a test. They will scrape a small sample of skin from your scalp and look at it under a microscope. This can help them rule out other conditions that cause hair loss. You may also have a blood test to look for other autoimmune diseases.","The condition cannot be prevented or avoided. The cause is unknown and varies by person. Alopecia areata is not tied to stress, as some people believe. Some people have a family history of alopecia areata. Having a family member with alopecia areata and another immune system disease can raise your risk of having it. Other immune system diseases include type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, lupus, Addison’s disease, and atopic dermatitis. It is rare for a parent to pass the condition onto a child.","There is no cure for alopecia areata. If you have a few, small patches of hair loss on your head, it’s likely your hair will grow back within a few months. Your doctor may not prescribe treatment in those cases.

For larger areas of hair loss, your doctor may prescribe steroid injections under your scalp. This could help regrow your hair. Other treatments include hair growth medicines that contain steroids that you apply to your skin.

Contact immunotherapy is another treatment. It purposely causes an allergic reaction on your scalp that could trigger hair growth. With this treatment, the medicine that is applied to your scalp irritates your skin, making it red and scaly. It could take as long as three months to see hair growth if this treatment works. Contact immunotherapy does have side effects, including a severe rash and swollen lymph nodes in your neck.

No matter what therapy you try, hair loss usually returns when you stop treatment.","The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recognizes that living with alopecia areata can be emotionally difficult. It affects social interaction and self-confidence, as people are embarrassed to let others see their hair loss. It can also be frustrating to not know if your hair is going to grow back or fall out again.

Consider joining a patient support group for people who have alopecia areata. Support groups give you a chance to talk about your condition. They help you realize you are not alone in your frustration with alopecia areata. A support group can be a good resource for practical tips to deal with the condition.

Hairstyling techniques or hair care products can help to cover bare patches on your head. But some products can be harsh on your hair. This could cause additional damage and loss. You might want to talk with your doctor about what products to avoid. People who have alopecia areata are encouraged to be creative with hats, scarves, and wigs.

Losing your eyelashes, eyebrows, and the hair in your nose and ears also can be a problem. Hair protects your eyes, nose, and ears from the irritation of dust, germs, and small, foreign particles. Wear eyeglasses or sunglasses to protect your eyes. You can use antibiotic ointment inside your nose to help keep germs out.

Be sure to cover areas of exposed scalp with a hat or sunscreen to reduce your risk of sunburn and skin cancer.","• How much hair do I need to lose before calling my doctor?

16,Alzheimer's Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/alzheimers-disease/,Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia. Dementia is a condition that describes a wide range of,"symptoms. The symptoms are associated with physical and functional changes in the brain. Dementia usually affects a person’s memory, thinking abilities, and personality. In the later stages, a person who has dementia has difficulty caring for themselves.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older persons. However, other things can also cause dementia. Alzheimer’s disease most commonly affects people older than 65 years of age. People who are younger than 65 years of age can also have Alzheimer’s disease. This is called early onset Alzheimer’s disease. Early onset Alzheimer’s disease is not very common.

If you are worried you or a loved one may have Alzheimer’s disease, there are 10 primary symptoms to consider. Every person is different and may have more or fewer than these 10 symptoms. Talk to your doctor if you notice 1 or more in yourself or a loved one.

• Memory loss that affects daily life: Forgetting important dates or things you just learned or asking the same question over and over. Or you may rely more on reminder notes, technology, or other family members to remember things.
• Changes in the ability to follow a plan or solve a problem: This may include having trouble focusing on a problem. It could also mean trouble following a plan, such as a recipe. Or keeping track of regularly scheduled tasks, such as paying monthly bills.
• Changes in the ability to complete familiar tasks: Alzheimer disease can make it hard to do the things that you used to do all the time. For example, it might be hard to do chores at home, run errands, or finish a routine task at work.
• Confusion about time or place: Losing track of how much time has passed, the date or the day of the week, or forgetting where you are and how you got there.
• Problems with vision or understanding visual information: Examples include trouble with reading comprehension, identifying colors, judging distances, or getting confused about what you see.
• Problems with words: This may include forgetting words in the middle of a conversation, repeating parts of a conversation, or calling things by the wrong names.
• Misplacing things: This could mean putting things in unusual places, losing things often, being unable to retrace steps to find a lost object, and even accusing others of stealing.
• Poor judgment: Examples include paying less attention to appearance or cleanliness. It could also mean using poor judgment with money, such as giving large amounts of money to solicitors.
• Withdrawal from activities: This could include withdrawing from social activities, work projects, or family gathering. It may also mean abandoning a hobby, sport, or favorite activity.
• Changes in mood and personality: Becoming unusually confused, suspicious, upset, depressed, fearful, or anxious. This may happen when in new or unfamiliar places.

Alzheimer’s disease is called a progressive disease. This means that its symptoms usually start slowly and are mild. A person’s cognitive (brain) and functional (self-care) abilities get worse over time. In the later stages of the disease, a person who has Alzheimer’s disease is no longer able to communicate and depends entirely on other people for care.

As the disease progresses, a person can experience health complications, including:

• Depression
• Unreported pain, illness, or medicine side effects (due to the inability to communicate)
• Falls
• Pneumonia or other infections
• Malnutrition or dehydration

If you think that a loved one might be experiencing any of the complications listed above, talk to their doctor. He or she can provide medicine or other treatments to help keep your loved one comfortable.

When a loved one has dementia, your family doctor can be a trusted resource and partner in their care. Read More","Doctors don’t know what causes Alzheimer’s disease. One theory is that the disease develops when clumps of abnormal proteins grow in the brain. This growth likely begins with many small changes in the brain. This typically starts long before any symptoms are noticeable. Over time, these changes add up. Eventually, brain cells become damaged and die.

Also, doctors believe certain things increase a person’s risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. Those risks factors include:

• Age: The older you are, the greater your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. After age 65, your chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease doubles every 5 years.
• Genetics and family history: You are more likely to get Alzheimer’s disease if you have a family history of it. Scientists also think that certain genes in your DNA may increase your risk for Alzheimer’s disease..
• Down syndrome: People who have Down syndrome have a much higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease than the general population.
• Environmental/lifestyle factors: It is likely that your environment and your lifestyle habits also affect your risk for Alzheimer’s disease. A history of head trauma, cardiovascular or heart problems, diabetes, and obesity appear to increase your risk. To help prevent these health problems, wear a helmet when riding a bicycle, always buckle your seat belt when in the car, establish a regular exercise routine, eat right, and avoid tobacco products.

Alzheimer’s disease also appears to be more common in women than in men. Nearly two-thirds of people who have Alzheimer’s disease are women.","An Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis may take some time. There is no test that can tell your doctor whether you have the disease. Give your doctor plenty of information to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Your doctor may want to evaluate the following in you or your loved one:

• Current health and medical history
• Daily routine and any changes in your behavior
• Memory, problem-solving, attention, and language abilities
• Lab tests, such as blood or urine tests
• Brain scans to look for problems, such as stroke, that may be causing symptoms

Based on this information, your doctor can almost always tell whether you have dementia. Your doctor will likely be able to tell whether Alzheimer’s disease is the cause. Alzheimer’s disease can only be diagnosed with certainty after death. That is when the brain is examined under a microscope. The brain will show distinct changes that only happen when Alzheimer’s disease is the cause.

If you are worried that you or a loved one might have some of the warning signs of Alzheimer’s disease, talk to your doctor. An early diagnosis will help you get treatment sooner. Also, it will give you time to address questions of care, finances, and legal issues with your family.","No one knows how to prevent or avoid Alzheimer’s disease. However, doctors believe that healthy living and keeping your brain active can help lower your risk. Or it may delay its onset and progression. That means eating a healthy diet, low alcohol consumption, not smoking, staying physically, socially, and mentally active.

Screening may be valuable in early detection for many diseases. However, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) states that there is not enough current evidence to show that routine screening for cognitive impairment is helpful.","There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease. Instead, treatment may focus on:

• Slowing the progression of symptoms, such as memory loss
• Addressing behavior changes, such as depression and aggression
• Helping to relieve other symptoms, such as sleep problems

Some medicines are currently being used to treat memory and behavior symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. These medicines do not stop the disease. They may not work for every person or may help for only a short time. They include:

• Cholinesterase inhibitors are approved to treat early and moderate stages of Alzheimer Dementia. Typical side effects of this medicine include diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
• Memantine is a drug approved to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. It may be used alone or in addition to a cholinesterase inhibitor. It may cause side effects such as dizziness and headaches.

Your doctor may recommend or prescribe medicine for behavioral changes. The type of medicine will depend on the behavior and the severity of the problem. Over-the-counter medicine might include pain relievers. Prescription medicine might include antidepressants, anti-anxiety medicines, and sleep medicines.

Drugs don’t always help relieve the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Non-drug treatments for a person who has Alzheimer’s disease often include managing your loved one’s environment and establishing a routine to help reduce stress and anxiety.

Some commonly used medications can worsen the symptoms of dementia. Review your medications with your doctor to see if any may need to be changed or stopped.",The life expectancy for a person diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease differs with each person. Most people live 4 to 8 years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Some live with the disease for up to 20 years. Death does not occur from the disease but as result of its complications.,"• How would I recognize signs of dementia in myself?

17,Amblyopia (Lazy Eye),https://familydoctor.org/condition/amblyopia/,"Amblyopia is also called “lazy eye.” It is an eye problem that starts in early childhood. Amblyopia is the most common cause of vision problems in children. It happens when one eye doesn’t work properly with the brain. The brain favors the eye that does work correctly. This causes a loss of vision in the other eye.

Amblyopia usually affects only one of the eyes. Sometimes it can affect both. It is important to detect amblyopia in your child early and treat it promptly. If you do, they most likely will not have long-term vision problems. Left untreated, it can cause severe vision problems, including legal blindness.

Amblyopia usually starts between birth and age 7.","Symptoms in your child could include:

• Eyes that don’t work together
• One eye that wanders inward or outward
• Squinting, shutting one eye, or tilting the head to look at something
• Problems with depth perception
• An upper eyelid that droops

Sometimes symptoms are not noticeable except in an eye exam.","All babies are born with poor eyesight. As they grow older, their vision continues to improve. For good eyesight, both eyes need to provide the same clear, focused image. Some children develop conditions that cause problems with their vision. These problems can cause the child to get a different picture from each eye. The child’s brain naturally tries to fix this problem by blocking out the weaker picture. If the problem is not fixed when the child is young, the child’s brain will always ignore pictures from the weak eye. This causes amblyopia.

Any condition that prevents the eye from focusing clearly can cause amblyopia. The 3 most common conditions are:

• Strabismus (also called crossed eyes) – The eyes don’t line up in the same direction. This is the most common cause of amblyopia.
• Refractive error –This includes nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. It is more likely to cause amblyopia if the error is greater in one eye.
• Cataracts – These cause clouding in the lens of the eye. Cataracts in children are uncommon.

Some children have a higher risk of having amblyopia. These include children who:

• Were born prematurely.
• Were small at birth.
• Have a family history of amblyopia.
• Have developmental disabilities.","If you notice any of the above symptoms in your child, even when they are an infant, call your doctor. They will do an eye exam. They will ask about symptoms, family history, and risk factors.

Otherwise, children should have an initial eye checkup between the ages of 3 and 5.","Amblyopia cannot be prevented. But vision loss resulting from it can be avoided. Watch your child’s vision habits. If you have any concerns, call your doctor. When amblyopia is caught and treated early, children should be able to keep most of their vision. If it is left untreated past the age of 10, they will probably have vision problems for the rest of their life. Early detection is the key to preventing vision loss.","Treatment for amblyopia involves the child using the weaker eye more. This helps the eye get stronger. To make the child use the weaker eye, they will wear an adhesive patch over the stronger eye. Most children wear their patches 2 to 6 hours a day.

Sometimes, eye drops or special glasses are used to blur the vision in the stronger eye. This also makes the weaker eye work harder and strengthens it. Glasses or contact lenses can fix problems with nearsightedness or farsightedness. Surgery may be needed for cataracts, droopy eyelids, or crossed eyes.

Treatment usually lasts until vision is normal, or until vision stops getting better. For most children, this takes several weeks to several months. A few children need to use eye patches until they are 8 to 10 years old.

There’s a small chance that using an eye patch for too long can hurt the strong eye. Children who are wearing eye patches should see their doctor often during the treatment.

The first years of life are the most important for eyesight development. During a child’s first 7 to 10 years, connections between the eye and brain are created. It is much more effective to treat amblyopia while those connections are still maturing. After your child’s vision system is fully developed, it is hard to change. If the amblyopia hasn’t been treated, they will most likely have poor vision for life. It won’t be possible to fix it with glasses, patching, or any other treatment.

One clinical trial showed that there could be benefits for treating children up to age 17. More research is needed on how treatment could help teenagers or adults.","Depending on your child’s age, it could be difficult for them to wear an eye patch. If a patch bothers your child, ask your doctor if you have other options. Glasses or eye drops might be a better choice for your child.

Amblyopia can come back after treatment is finished. It’s important to continue to watch your child for symptoms. If symptoms do come back, treatment will need to be repeated. Some children’s treatment lasts until they are 10 years old.","• Will my child always have vision problems?
• What is the best way to treat amblyopia?
• Will my child need glasses or contacts?
• My child needs to wear an eye patch. How long will they wear it?
• Are there any long-term problems from amblyopia?
• My child doesn’t like the eye patch. Are they a candidate for the eye drops?","National Eye Institute: Amblyopia

18,Amenorrhea,https://familydoctor.org/condition/amenorrhea/,Amenorrhea is the medical term for when a woman doesn’t have menstrual periods. There are two types of amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is when you are late to start your period for the first time. The normal age range is 14 to 16 years old. Secondary amenorrhea is when you miss a period for 3 months in a row or more.,"The main symptom of amenorrhea is the absence of your monthly period. It often signifies a larger health problem or condition. Related symptoms can include:

• Headache.
• Vision changes.
• Nausea.
• Extra facial hair.
• Hair loss.
• Changes in breast size.
• Milky fluid, or discharge, from breasts.","The main causes of primary amenorrhea include family history, genetics, and lifestyle. Women with the following factors are more at risk:

• A family history of amenorrhea or early menopause.
• A genetic or chromosomal defect. These can affect your ovary function and menstrual cycle. Turner syndrome is one example.
• Severely overweight or underweight.
• An eating disorder.
• An extreme exercise pattern.
• A poor diet.
• Stress.

Pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause can cause secondary amenorrhea. Other possible causes include:

• Some birth controls, such as pills, injections, or intrauterine devices. These can affect your menstrual cycle during and after use.
• Some medicines for depression and blood pressure.
• Chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
• Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
• Fragile X syndrome (caused by the FMR1 gene) or fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI).
• Problems with your thyroid or pituitary gland.
• Hypothalamic disease.
• Uterine scar tissue.","Contact your family doctor or a gynecologist if you think you have amenorrhea. If you’ve never menstruated, the doctor will review your health history and do an exam. A regular physical and pelvic check can show signs of puberty.

For secondary amenorrhea, the doctor will begin with a pregnancy test. If this is negative, he or she will do an exam and review your health history.

Your doctor may order additional tests to rule out or determine a cause. A karyotype test looks at your chromosomes. A genetic test looks for the mutated FMR1 gene. Imaging tests can look at your female organs. A blood test can check your:

• Thyroid function (thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, levels).
• Ovary function (follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, and luteinizing hormone, or LH, levels).
• Testosterone (“male hormone”) levels, which can detect PCOS.
• Estrogen (“female hormone”) levels.","It is hard to prevent amenorrhea. Try to maintain a healthy diet and exercise plan. If you are underweight or overweight, talk to your doctor about how to find a balance. Once you begin to menstruate, keep track of your periods each month. This can help identify the condition early on and aid in your diagnosis and treatment. It also is good practice if you try to become pregnant in the future.","Treatment options for amenorrhea vary based on the cause. You may need to make lifestyle changes, such as diet, activity, and stress. Certain hormonal medicines and birth control pills can help trigger a period. Others can help trigger ovulation, such as for PCOS. Hormone therapy may be used to balance out your hormones.

Surgery is rare, but may be needed in some cases, such as:

• To correct genetic or chromosomal defects.
• To remove a pituitary (brain) tumor.
• To remove uterine scar tissue.","For most women, their monthly periods return following treatment. In some cases, your related health problem may mean you never have a period. Depending on your underlying cause, you may struggle with fertility.","• If I have amenorrhea, can I still get pregnant?
• What are the benefits, risks, and side effects of treatment?
• If I have amenorrhea, will I always have it or can I get it again?","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child and Human Health Development: Amenorrhea

19,Anal Fissure,https://familydoctor.org/condition/anal-fissures/,"An anal fissure is a small crack or tear in the thin, moist lining of the lower rectum. It’s a common condition. Sometimes people confuse anal fissures with hemorrhoids.",The most common symptom of an anal fissure is a shooting pain in the anus and surrounding area. Anal fissures often cause painful bowel movements and bleeding. You may also see blood on the toilet paper after wiping. Anal fissures may also cause itching in the anal area.,"Anal fissures are usually a result of straining during a bowel movement, causing injury to the anal canal. They also can be caused by repeated diarrhea, when blood flow to the area is decreased (in older adults), after childbirth, or in people with Crohn’s disease.","Your doctor will perform a rectal exam. Usually, a visual exam is all that’s necessary to see the fissure. Your doctor might have to insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the anal canal.","Keeping bowel movements regular and avoiding constipation can help reduce your chances of an anal fissure. Add more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to your diet to get enough fiber. Drink plenty of fluids and get some exercise in every day to help keep your digestive system moving.","About half of all fissures heal by themselves and need no treatment at all. If fissures don’t heal on their own, other treatments may involve prescription creams such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers. You may even need Botox injections into the muscle in the anus (called the anal sphincter). Minor surgery to relax the anal muscle can be used as a last resort.","Your doctor may prescribe stool softeners to make going to the bathroom easier and less painful while the fissure heals. Numbing cream can also make bowel movements less painful. Petroleum jelly, zinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, and products like Preparation H can help soothe the area. Instead of toilet paper, use alcohol-free baby wipes that are gentler on the area.

Sitz baths can help heal fissures and make you feel better. Fill the tub with enough lukewarm water to cover your hips and buttocks. Don’t use soap or bubbles or any other products unless prescribed by your doctor. Relax in the sitz bath 2 to 3 times a day for about 10 minutes at a time.

People who develop fissures once are more likely to have them in the future, so it’s important to keep bowel movements regular. If you’ve had a fissure in the past, you may be tempted to hold your bowel movement in to avoid the pain of passing it. But that’s not a good idea. That can make stools become hard and difficult to pass, which will make the fissure worse. Continue with a high-fiber diet and drink plenty of liquid to help make stools easy to pass.","• How can I add more fiber to my diet?
• Should I use fiber supplements?
• Should I use laxatives?
• What products do you recommend I use while I have the fissure?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Anal Fissure

20,Anal Fistulas,https://familydoctor.org/condition/anal-fistulas/,An anal fistula is an abnormal tube-like connection that forms between the inside of the anus (at the anal gland) and the skin right outside the anus. Think of it as a tunnel under your skin.,The abscess that causes the fistula is quite painful. It can cause intense pain and swelling around the anus. This pain gets worse with bowel movements. Sometimes there’s discharge from the opening around the anus. You may also have a fever and bleeding around the area.,"An anal fistula usually begins with an infection in an anal gland. This infection can cause an abscess (a swollen area where pus gathers). As the pus drains, it can leave a channel between the bowel and the skin. This channel (or tunnel) is the fistula.","Your doctor can diagnose an anal fistula with a physical exam of the anal area. If your doctor sees a fistula, they will usually try to determine the depth and direction of the fistula. In some cases, your doctor may order an ultrasound or an MRI. These tests will let your doctor see the fistula inside your body.","Almost all anal fistulas develop as a result of an abscess in the area. Sometimes abscesses are caused by Crohn’s disease, trauma, or STIs.","Most anal abscesses can be drained in a doctor’s office under local anesthesia. If a fistula has developed, the doctor will need to surgically remove it.

After the fistula has been removed, you’ll need to take antibiotics. You may want to wear a pad over your anal area until you’re healed. Sitz baths can help you feel better. Fill the tub with enough lukewarm water to cover your hips and buttocks. Don’t use soap, bubbles, or any other products unless prescribed by your doctor. Relax in the sitz bath 3 to 4 times a day for about 10 minutes at a time.

With surgery and proper care after surgery, most fistulas do not return.","Most fistulas respond well to surgical treatment. If your fistula surgery is more complicated due to the location of it, your doctor may need to cut a small portion of your sphincter muscle during surgery. Your doctor will make every attempt to prevent muscle damage. There is a chance, though, that it may be harder for you to control your bowels after surgery. If the doctor believes this is likely, they may suggest other techniques or treatments for dealing with your fistula.","• What caused my anal fistula?
• Do I need surgery?
• If so, how long do I need to wait after surgery to resume normal activities?

21,Anaphylaxis: Your guide to prevention,https://familydoctor.org/condition/anaphylaxis/,"Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening, whole-body reaction that often occurs when you are exposed to certain foods (different from food intolerance), insect bites/stings, certain medicines, and latex. Anaphylactic reactions can range in severity and not all allergic reactions lead to anaphylaxis. But when it does occur, you need immediate medical attention or to call 911.","The primary symptom of anaphylaxis is a blocked airway and requires immediate 911 medical attention. Generally, symptoms are sudden (within 5 to 30 minutes of exposure) and vary based on degree of allergy and the amount of exposure. They range from mild to severe. Possible symptoms (or warning signs) include:

• Swelling in your mouth, throat, or other body part
• Hives, rash, or itchy skin
• Pale skin, or skin that is red and warm (flushed)
• Trouble breathing or gasping for breath
• A tight feeling in your chest
• Dizziness
• Fainting
• Stomach pain
• Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
• A feeling of anxiety
• Low blood pressure
• Cardiac arrest","• There are 33 million Americans living with a life-threatening food allergy. Of that total, one in 13 children have life-threatening food allergies. Between 150 and 200 deaths per year are caused by allergic reactions to food.
• Approximately 40 deaths per year are caused by allergic reactions to insect stings.
• About 400 deaths per year are caused by allergic reactions to medicine.
• Between 1-6% of Americans have a latex allergy.

There are simple ways you can ease mild reactions to a bee sting and avoid getting stung again. Read More

The most common causes of anaphylaxis are reactions to foods (especially eating or touching peanuts), medications, and insect stings. Other causes include exercise and exposure to latex. Sometimes the cause is unknown. During a normal reaction, your body makes antibodies to fight the allergen. During a severe reaction, your immune system can panic. This leads to anaphylaxis.

Know these causes of anaphylaxis:

• Foods such as shellfish, nuts, peanuts, eggs, and fruits
• Medicines, such as antibiotics, aspirin, over-the-counter pain relievers, allergy shots, and contrast dye used in imaging procedures, such as MRIs, etc.
• Latex or rubber found in surgical gloves, medical supplies, and many products in your home
• Insect stings, such as from bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, sawflies, and fire ants

Most people who have food allergies are allergic to fewer than four foods. Additionally, some food additives, such as yellow food dye and aspartame (artificial sweetener), can cause an allergic reaction. Although sugar and certain fats are not considered healthy choices, they are not associated with food allergies.

Some things may increase the risk for anaphylaxis:

• Previous anaphylaxis. If you’ve had anaphylaxis once, your risk of having this again increases. Future reactions could be worse than the first time.
• Allergies or asthma. People who have either condition are at increased risk of having anaphylaxis.
• Certain medical conditions. These include heart disease and an irregular accumulation of a certain type of white blood cell (mastocytosis).","Unless you have known risk factors for anaphylaxis, you won’t know if it could happen to you. However, you know you are at risk, here’s how to reduce your risk for a reaction:

• Avoid eating or touching any foods you are allergic to. Ask restaurant servers about the ingredients in the food you order, including peanuts (and peanut sauce), shellfish, eggs, and fruits. Be sure to tell your server you have an allergy to the ingredient in question.
• Read the ingredients and all other important warnings on labels of packaged goods. Even if a product doesn’t contain the ingredient you are allergic to, it may have been manufactured in a facility that is exposed to those ingredients. For example, packaged sugar cookie dough may come with a warning that it was made near other products containing peanuts.
• Tell all your health care providers what you are allergic to.
• If you are allergic to insect stings, wear protective clothing and insect repellent when you are outside.
• Wear a medical alert necklace or bracelet to indicate you have an allergy to specific drugs or other substances.
• Prepare and always carry an emergency kit with you that contains the medicines you need to treat your allergic reaction. For example, if you have been prescribed an EpiPen (epinephrine) to treat a peanut allergy, make sure it is in the kit and with you for immediate care. Regularly check to see if your medicine is filled and its expiration date. Teach family, friends, and coworkers how to use it. After treatment, you should have someone stay with you for 24 hours to make sure another attack does not occur. Your kit may also include an antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (brand name: Benadryl).

If you don’t know if you are allergic to something, you may only find out if you have a reaction. If you suspect you are allergic to something, talk to your doctor about testing for that item. Your doctor will identify your food allergy as one of two types:

• Immunoglobulin E (IgE)‐mediated: This is when your immune system produces IgE antibodies, which can lead to hives, swelling, trouble breathing, vomiting, and anaphylaxis within seconds to two hours after consuming the trigger food.
• Non-IgE-mediated: This is when your immune system reacts without IgE antibodies. With this type, you can experience stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in stool, and delayed eczema within hours to days after being exposed to the trigger item.

Your doctor will also ask about your health history and risk factors. Be prepared to give your doctor as much history as possible about your allergic reaction Some things to note include:

• The symptoms you have after exposure to certain things
• How long after the exposure these symptoms occurred
• How much exposure you had
• How often the reaction has occurred
• Whether it occurs in other situations
• Whether it occurs every time you are exposed to the same thing
• What type of medical treatment, if any, you received after having symptoms

If you have a food allergy, your doctor may put you on an elimination diet. This is when you don’t eat any suspicious foods for a while then gradually add them back one at a time. Your doctor also may perform a blood test to measure the levels of IgE antibodies specific to different foods. Elevated levels of IgE for a specific food suggest a possible allergy.

Your doctor may perform an oral food challenge (OFC) test. It is considered the gold standard in testing for food allergies. It involves a person eating increasing amounts of the suspected allergen (under medical supervision) until they reach the amount that might trigger a reaction. If no reaction occurs, the person can usually continue to eat that food.

Once a food allergy is diagnosed, avoid the food that causes it. If you have an allergy, you must read the labels on all prepared foods you eat. Your doctor can help you learn how to avoid eating the wrong foods.

Another allergy test is a skin prick test. It works like this:

• A medical professional will apply a small amount of liquid containing a suspected allergen on your skin.
• They will lightly prick your skin under the drop to allow the allergen to penetrate.
• If a raised, red, itchy bump (wheal) develops within 15-30 minutes, it indicates you may have a possible allergy.

Testing children for allergies in children may differ slightly. The most common allergen concern for children is peanuts. Recent studies have found that some food allergies — such as peanut allergies — can be prevented if they are introduced and treated within the baby’s first year. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommends that infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both be introduced to foods containing peanuts as early as four months of age to reduce the risk of a peanut allergy. Talk to your doctor before introducing foods containing peanuts at this early age.

Similar strategies may be beneficial for other common allergens, too. Always talk to your doctor first. They typically follow this testing plan:

• High-risk infants (those with severe eczema or existing food allergies): Introduce peanut-containing foods as early as four to six months. Do this only after making sure the infant is ready for solid foods.
• Infants with mild to moderate eczema: Introduce peanut-containing foods around six months of age.
• Infants without eczema or food allergies: Introduce allergenic foods freely with other solid foods, according to family preferences and cultural practices.","• Start with small amounts of age-appropriate foods, such as thinned peanut butter or well-cooked eggs.
• Ensure your baby is healthy and developmentally ready for solid foods.
• Introduce one new food at a time, monitoring for any reactions.

If your child has food allergies, give their school and other care providers instructions on what foods to avoid. Tell them what to do if the food is accidentally eaten. Many children usually outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, soybean products, and wheat. People rarely outgrow allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish.

If you or someone around you has anaphylaxis, call 911 immediately. Call your doctor if you have milder symptoms of anaphylaxis. Most important is to avoid the items that caused the allergic reaction.

If you have a food allergy, eliminate the possibility of cross-contamination in food preparation areas. An example of this is to properly wash and sanitize your hands, cutting boards, and utensils that were used to prepare the food that causes the allergic reaction. Plan for direct exposure and cross-contamination by talking with your hosts who are preparing food in their home. Inform restaurant servers and read the instructions on prepared food packaging.",null,null,"• How should I handle having a food allergy reaction?

• Eggs: Early introduction may reduce the risk of an egg allergy.
• Cow’s milk, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and sesame: Introducing these foods during infancy may help prevent allergies, though your doctor’s guidance and more research is needed.

Treatment for anaphylaxis should begin immediately. If you see someone have a reaction, call 911 to get medical help. If the person has an emergency kit with an EpiPen, inject it into the muscle of their arm or leg. An EpiPen is a short-term treatment. The person still should go to the hospital for treatment and care. Certain allergies may require a series of desensitization shots.

If you have a mild reaction (itching, sneezing, hives, or rash) to an allergen, your doctor will give you antihistamines and oral or topical steroid medicine.

Also, plan by preparing for known allergies by creating an individual or family emergency plan. This contains information about what item the individual is allergic to and how to respond with medicine or calling 911.

Keep multiple emergency anaphylaxis kits with you to keep at home and to carry with you when you leave your home.

Living with allergies to food, insect bites/stings, medicines and latex can cause fear and anxiety. Ease your mind by avoiding your known allergen triggers, speaking up with family, friends, and restaurant servers, and talk to your doctor regularly. There may be new medicines to treat your allergies. Also, certain allergies may benefit from a series of desensitization shots to reduce the seriousness of your reaction when you are exposed."
22,Anemia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/anemia/,"Anemia is the most common blood disorder in the United States. It affects your red blood cells and hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. You need iron in order to make hemoglobin. Most people who have anemia have a shortage of iron. This condition is called iron deficiency anemia.

There are a few other types of anemia, including:

• Aplastic anemia. This occurs when your bone marrow has damaged stem cells. Your body fails to produce enough new blood cells. The condition affects your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes it is called bone marrow failure.
• Hemolytic anemia. This occurs when your body destroys red blood cells before they should. The normal lifespan of red blood cells is 120 days.
• Normocytic anemia. This occurs when your red blood cells are normal in size, but low in count.
• Pernicious anemia. This occurs when your body lacks vitamin B12. It causes a shortage of healthy red blood cells.
• Sickle cell anemia (a form of sickle cell disease). This is a genetic disease that affects your red blood cells. It occurs when you are born with 2 abnormal hemoglobin genes.","Mild forms of anemia may not cause any symptoms. Fatigue, or feeling tired, is a common symptom. This is because the hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen. A lack of oxygen reduces energy. It can cause your heart to work harder to pump oxygen. Other common anemia symptoms include:

• Paleness
• Shortness of breath
• Cold hands and feet
• Headaches
• Dizziness
• Fast, slow, or uneven heartbeat
• Brittle nails or hair loss
• Strange food cravings (known as pica)

Contact your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. They can diagnose the type and cause of the condition.","There are three main reasons why anemia occurs.

• Your body can’t produce enough red blood cells.","Talk to your doctor if you think you or your child might have anemia. They will do a physical exam and review your health history and symptoms. To diagnose anemia, your doctor will test your blood. This test is called a complete blood count (CBC). Based on the results, they may need to do other tests, such as testing your bone marrow. This can help confirm the cause of anemia or another health condition.","You cannot avoid anemia caused by a genetic disease. You often cannot avoid it due to blood loss. If your blood loss is from heavy periods, receiving treatment can help prevent anemia. If your body can’t absorb certain nutrients, such as iron or vitamin B12, talk to your doctor about taking a supplement. This can help manage your levels and prevent anemia.

A balanced diet can help prevent some types of anemia. Eat foods high in iron to prevent a deficiency.

• Red meat
• Seafood
• Organ meats (such as liver)
• Whole grains
• Dried fruits
• Beans (especially lima beans)
• Dark green leafy vegetables (such as spinach and broccoli)
• Iron-fortified foods like breads and cereals (check the label)

Vitamin C can help your body absorb iron. Try eating foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits or juice, peppers, and broccoli. Some foods can make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include coffee, tea, milk, egg whites, fiber, and soy protein. Try to avoid these foods if you have iron deficiency anemia.

Foods high in vitamin B12 include:

• Meat and poultry
• Organ meats (such as liver)
• Fish and shellfish
• Eggs, milk, and dairy products
• Some fortified cereals, grains, and yeasts (check the label)

Foods high in folic acid (folate) include:

• Dark green leafy vegetables (such as spinach and broccoli)
• Asparagus
• Beans
• Lentils
• Bananas, oranges, and orange juice

Pregnant people may be tested for anemia or take an iron supplement to help prevent it. However, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) has insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and risks of screening all pregnant people for iron deficiency anemia or having them take an iron supplement.

Evidence also is lacking to measure the benefits and risks of screening children ages 6 to 24 months. To help prevent your child from getting iron deficiency anemia, you can:

• Use iron-fortified formula
• Use iron-fortified cereal starting around 4 months of age
• Limit your child to less than 24 oz. (3 cups) of cow’s milk per day (after 12 months of age)
• Introduce foods high in iron starting around 12 months of age

Warning: Keep all products with iron stored out of reach of your child. Iron can be toxic if taken in large amounts.","There are many treatment options for anemia. They vary based on the type, cause, and severity, as well as your overall health. The first goal of treatment is to create more healthy red blood cells that can carry enough oxygen to your body. Often this is achieved by increasing your red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin. The other goal is to treat the cause, if possible. For example, if anemia results from losing too much blood, your doctor will need to treat the cause of your blood loss.

If you have a type of anemia caused by a deficiency, make changes to your diet. This can increase your nutrient levels or help your body absorb nutrients.

In some cases, your doctor can prescribe medicine to help your body produce more red blood cells. Examples include:

• Erythropoietin shots to treat normocytic anemia (these can help your bone marrow produce more red blood cells)
• Hormone medicines to treat heavy periods
• Antibiotic medicines to treat infections
• Medicines to help prevent your body from damaging or destroying red blood cells

Other forms of anemia require intense treatment. You may need surgery to stop blood loss or have your spleen removed. Other treatments include a blood transfusion or a blood and bone marrow stem cell transplant.

Talk to your doctor about how to manage a chronic disease or other health problem that causes anemia.","Following treatment, most people go on to live normal, healthy lives. However, anemia can have lasting, or life-threatening, effects. These are more common if the condition is chronic, severe, or left untreated. They include:

• Arrhythmia. This is an issue with your heartbeat. It can be too fast, too slow, or uneven. Over time, this can lead to heart disease or heart failure.
• Organ damage. This can occur if an organ doesn’t get enough oxygen.
• Weakened immune system. This can be fatal if your immune system already is weak from cancer, disease (such as HIV/AIDS), or an infection.

Children who have iron deficiency anemia have a higher risk of lead poisoning. They also can develop mental, motor, or behavioral problems over a long time.

Pregnant women who have iron deficiency anemia may have their baby premature or at a low birth weight. There also is a risk of needing a blood transfusion if you lose a lot of blood during delivery. Anemia may be associated with postpartum depression.","• If I have anemia once, will I always have it, or will it come back again?
• If I have anemia during pregnancy, is there a risk of passing it to my children?
• If I have anemia during pregnancy, am I more at risk of having it after?
• If I have a health condition that causes anemia, what is the risk of passing it to my children?","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Anemia

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Not being able to produce enough red blood cells can happen for several reasons, including diet, pregnancy, disease, and more.

Your body may not produce enough red blood cells if you lack certain nutrients. Low iron is a common problem. People who don’t eat meat or follow “fad” diets are more at risk of low iron. Infants and toddlers are at risk of getting anemia from a low-iron diet. Not having enough vitamin B12 and folic acid can cause anemia as well.

Certain diseases affect your small intestine‘s ability to absorb nutrients. For example, Crohn’s disease and celiac disease can cause low iron levels in your body. Some foods, like milk, can prevent your body from absorbing iron. Taking vitamin C can help this. Medicines, such as antacids or prescriptions to reduce acid in your stomach, can affect it as well.

People who are pregnant or breastfeeding can get anemia. When you’re pregnant, you need more blood (up to 30% more) to share with the baby. If your body lacks iron or vitamin B12, it can’t produce enough red blood cells.

The following factors may increase your risk of anemia during pregnancy:

• Vomiting a lot from morning sickness
• Having a diet low in nutrients
• Having heavy periods before pregnancy
• Having 2 pregnancies close together
• Being pregnant with multiple babies at once
• Becoming pregnant as a teenager
• Losing a lot of blood from an injury or surgery

Children younger than 3 years of age are prone to anemia. Their bodies grow so fast that they can have a hard time getting or keeping enough iron.

Normocytic anemia can be congenital (from birth) or acquired (from a disease or infection). The most common cause of the acquired form is a chronic (long-term) disease. Examples include kidney disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroiditis. Some medicines can cause normocytic anemia, but this is rare.

• Your body destroys red blood cells early and faster that they can be replaced.

Treatments, such as chemotherapy, can damage your red blood cells and/or bone marrow. Infection caused by a weakened immune system can lead to anemia. You may be born with a condition that destroys or remove red blood cells. Examples include sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and a lack of certain enzymes. Having an enlarged or diseased spleen can cause anemia, too.

• You have blood loss that creates a shortage of red blood cells.

Heavy periods may cause low iron levels in women. Internal bleeding, such as in your digestive or urinary tract, can cause blood loss. This can be caused by conditions such as a stomach ulcer or ulcerative colitis. Other reasons for blood loss include:

• Cancer
• Surgery
• Trauma
• Taking aspirin or a similar medicine for a long time"
23,Angina,https://familydoctor.org/condition/angina/,"Angina is a heart condition that causes chest pain or pressure. However, not all chest pain and pressure is heart-related.

There are three types of angina:

• Stable angina. This is the most common. It occurs when your heart muscle is not getting enough blood flow during periods of physical activity. Stable angina has a regular pattern. It is usually treated over a longer period. Treatment includes medicines as well as a gradual reintroduction to exercise. This is offered as part of a cardiac rehabilitation program. This improves your heart’s activity and can reduce risk factors that help the condition progress.
• Unstable angina. This is the most serious. It can occur without warning—even when you are not being physically active. And it does not follow a pattern. It lasts longer than stable angina. Rest and medicine do not relieve unstable angina. It can be a warning of a heart attack.
• Variant angina. This is rare. It typically happens during the night or early morning when you are at rest. It can cause severe pain. Medicines can help.

Angina can bother you when you are doing activities like walking, climbing stairs, exercising, or cleaning. You should go to the emergency room if you have chest pain that won’t go away.","• Chest pain or pressure
• Intense sweating
• Difficulty catching your breath
• Pain in your arm, neck, jaw or shoulder
• Nausea
• Fatigue (feeling overly tired)
• The feeling of gas or indigestion
• Pain that comes and goes","Angina is a form of heart disease. It is caused by blockages in the arteries that supply blood to your heart. Certain risk factors can lead to heart disease, including:

• High blood pressure
• Diabetes
• Smoking
• High cholesterol
• Menopause in women
• Family history of heart disease at a young age","Your doctor will examine your symptoms and ask you about your family history. To test for heart disease, your doctor might have you undergo one or more of the following tests:

• Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). This involves attaching wires and pads to your chest. It may detect damage to the heart and arteries. If the test is performed while you have angina, it can tell whether the pain is related to your heart.
• Stress test. This involves having you walk on a treadmill or taking certain medicines. On the treadmill, you will have the same wires and pads attached to your chest. It can detect any abnormalities with your heart while you are physically active.
• X-rays. This provides your doctor with a picture of your heart.
• Cardiac catheterization. During this test, your doctor will insert a very long, thin tube into an artery in your arm or leg. The doctor will guide the tube into your heart. Your doctor will inject dye into the arteries around the heart. They also will take X-rays during the procedure to look for blockages.","The best way to prevent angina is to prevent heart disease. If you have high blood pressure, diabetes, and/or high cholesterol, follow your doctor’s treatment plan. If you smoke, stop. Maintain a healthy diet, a healthy weight, and get regular exercise to avoid heart disease. If you already have heart disease, the steps listed above are important to help keep the problem from getting worse. If you have a family history of heart disease, talk to your doctor about ways of reducing risk factors that make it worse.","Severe angina is often treated with a medicine called nitroglycerin. Sometimes, your doctor may need to do a cardiac procedure to open blocked arteries. Cardiac rehabilitation might also be necessary. Overall, angina can be treated by treating your heart disease. If something other than heart disease is causing your chest pain, your doctor will recommend treatment for that condition.","Living with angina means controlling your risk factors. If you have heart disease caused by underlying conditions, follow your treatment plan for healthy living. Take your prescribed medicines.

You should contact your doctor or go to the emergency room if:

• Angina begins to occur at rest
• Angina becomes more frequent
• Angina lasts more than 5 minutes","• What lifestyle changes do I need to make to relieve my symptoms?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? How do I get started?
• Can surgery help?
• Will the medicine I’m prescribed interact with the medicines I’m already taking?
• What symptoms mean my condition is getting worse?

24,Ankle Sprains,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ankle-sprains-healing-preventing-injury/,"Your ankle is the joint that connects your leg to your foot. This joint is made up of bones and connected to three ligaments. These ligaments keep the bones from moving out of place. An ankle sprain happens when one or more of those ligaments is stretched or torn.

Sprained ankles are divided into three grades, based on severity.

• Grade 1: Mild sprain. It’s the most common. In this case, the ligament is stretched, not torn. You may experience minor pain and stiffness, but you can still get around.
• Grade 2: Moderate sprain. In this case, one or more ligaments are partially torn. Your ankle will likely be swollen, you will feel moderate pain, and it will be hard to stand on that foot.
• Grade 3: Severe sprain. Here, one or more ligaments are completely torn. Your ankle will be unstable, the pain will be severe, and you won’t be able to move your ankle.","Symptoms of ankle sprains include:

• Pain or tenderness
• Swelling
• Bruising
• Stiffness
• Coldness or numbness in your foot
• Inability to walk or put weight on that foot

With mild sprains, you may have stiffness while walking. That should get better in a few days to a few weeks. People who have moderate and severe sprains may have limits for several weeks. And they may have ankle pain for a year or more.","Ankle sprains often occur during physical activity. Sometimes they can happen when you walk or run on a rough surface. The unevenness can make you fall, land on your ankle wrong, and sprain it.

People who have high arches in their feet or weak muscles are more likely to sprain their ankles. If you’ve sprained your ankle before, you’re more likely to sprain it again.","Your doctor can diagnose an ankle sprain. He or she will examine your ankle and ask about your symptoms and activity. The doctor may take an X-ray to confirm your ankle isn’t broken or fractured. Once they diagnose the sprain, your doctor will determine the grade. This will determine the type of treatment you receive. If your ankle doesn’t get better, your doctor may request an MRI. This is a type of image that allows him or her to see the ligaments inside your ankle.","There are ways to help prevent an ankle sprain. Certain exercises can strengthen your ankle and the muscles around it. These exercises stabilize your ankle and improve your balance. It is also important to stretch before and after you exercise. Your doctor will show you which exercises are best.

Wear supportive shoes, whether you’ve had an ankle sprain before or not. This helps prevent your foot from twisting or your ankle joint from moving out of place. You may also find it helpful to wear an ankle brace when playing sports, running or jogging. This may add stability to your ankle.","You can treat a lot of ankle sprains at home. Doctors recommend the RICE approach (Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation), listed below.

• Rest: All ankle sprains require rest. The length of time will depend on the grade of sprain. Your doctor can help you with a timeline. You may need to use crutches if it hurts to put weight on your foot.
• Ice: Ice helps decrease swelling, bruising, pain, and muscle spasms. Putting ice on your ankle is helpful, but be careful. Place a thin, damp cloth on your ankle before applying the ice. That will help protect your skin from frostbite. Also, cold can also damage your nerves if you leave ice in place too long. You should only use ice for up to 20 minutes at a time. If your skin feels numb, it’s time to remove the ice. Use ice treatments every 2 to 4 hours for the first 3 days after your injury.
• Compression: Wrap your sprained ankle to avoid swelling and bruising. You might need to do this for several days or a week after your injury. Your doctor can show you the best way to do this.
• Elevation: Raise your ankle at or above the level of your heart. This prevents the swelling from getting worse and reduces bruising. Keep your ankle elevated for 2 to 3 hours a day.

To relieve pain, your doctor may suggest you take over-the-counter medicine. Examples include acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin, or Nuprin).

You’ll need additional treatment for a higher-grade ankle sprain. Your doctor might give you a cast, boot, or brace to wear. This will keep the ligaments and joint in place while they heal. It limits motion, provides protection, and helps reduce pain. You may need to wear it for 2 to 6 weeks. Your doctor may also refer you to physical therapy. The amount and length of time of treatment will depend on the grade of your sprain and your state of health.","Ankle sprains are common problems, but they do heal. However, depending on the grade of your sprain, you may not be able to return to normal activities right away. Your doctor can provide a time frame for your situation. Once you return to regular activities, you still may need to wear an ankle brace or bandage for support and protection.

Your doctor or physical therapist may provide a list of ankle exercises for you to do. This will help strengthen your muscles. He or she will tell you when to start the exercises and how long to do them. Depending on the severity of the sprain, you may need to do them for several weeks. It’s important you do the exercises for the amount of time your doctor says. This will help prevent future sprains.","• What grade of ankle sprain do I have?
• Do I need to wear a cast, boot, or brace? If so, for how long?
• How long until I can return to my regular activities?

25,Appendicitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/appendicitis/,"Appendicitis is inflammation or infection in your appendix. The appendix is a tube-like organ in your abdomen. It’s attached to your large intestine. If the infection isn’t treated, your appendix can become blocked. When this happens, the appendix can burst. This can cause the infection to spread throughout your abdomen. Anyone can get appendicitis. It’s most common in teens and young adults.","Appendicitis symptoms can start fast and get worse over time. They include:

• Pain on the right side of the abdomen
• Swelling and pressure in the abdomen
• Loss of appetite
• Nausea and vomiting
• Constipation or diarrhea
• Inability to pass gas
• Fever

Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms. Plus, other conditions can cause the same symptoms. These include constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal obstruction, ovarian cysts, and abdominal adhesions.","Several things can cause appendicitis. They include:

• A blocked opening inside the appendix
• Abdominal infection
• Inflammatory bowel disease
• Stool, parasites, or growths inside your appendix
• Trauma or injury to your abdomen

Sometimes, the cause is unknown.","Your doctor will do a physical exam. They also will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order certain tests. These include blood, urine, and possibly a pregnancy test. Additional tests may include an X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.",Appendicitis can’t be prevented. Research suggests there may be preventive benefits from maintaining a high-fiber diet. This would include fruits and vegetables.,"A mild case of appendicitis may be cured with antibiotics alone. Most of the time, surgery is required. This surgery is called an appendectomy. If you require surgery, your doctor will give you antibiotics before the procedure.

There are two types of surgery:

• During this procedure, a surgeon makes several small incisions in your abdomen. They will insert a scope to look inside. The surgeon will use small tools to remove the appendix through the small incisions. This type has a short recovery time.
• During this procedure, a surgeon removes your appendix through a single incision in the lower, right abdomen. This requires more recovery time and is often required in more complicated cases of appendicitis.

Patients usually recover well after surgery. You will need to limit physical activity for the first 3 to 5 days after laparoscopic surgery. Limit it for 10 to 14 days after a laparotomy.

If your appendix bursts, surgery and recovery are more complicated. Your surgeon will need to clean the infection that spreads inside your abdomen. If not treated quickly, the infection could lead to serious illness and death.","Appendicitis pain is often progressive and intense. Therefore, most people seek medical attention quickly.","• How can I tell appendicitis symptoms apart from other stomach problems?

However, they can be severe or life-threatening. Arrhythmias are more serious if you have other heart problems.

There are several types of arrhythmias. The type that starts in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) are often worse than those that start in the upper chambers (atria).

• Atrial fibrillation: Your heart beats irregularly and too fast. This type requires treatment. It can increase your risk of stroke.
• Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia: Your heart has episodes of beating too fast. This may cause discomfort. It is not severe.

It is usually not a cause for alarm. Talk to your doctor if you have symptoms. You may have an arrhythmia or other heart problem.

Possible signs of a more serious problem include:

• Palpitations or rapid thumping in your chest
• Feeling tired or light-headed
• Passing out
• Shortness of breath
• Chest pain

Get care right away if symptoms occur and you have a history of heart disease or heart attacks.","Your heart has 4 sections, or chambers. The walls of your heart squeeze together (contract) to push blood through the chambers. Electrical signals in your heart control these. Nerve impulses and hormones in your blood affect the rate of contractions. A problem in any of these areas can cause an arrhythmia.

Heart disease is the most common cause of the more serious forms of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias can be caused by congenital heart disease (CHD), abnormal heart valve function, and heart failure. Minor arrhythmias may be caused by other factors. These include alcohol abuse, smoking, caffeine, stress, or exercise. Arrhythmias also can occur for no known reason.

Minor arrhythmias may be caused by other factors. These include alcohol abuse, smoking, caffeine, stress, or exercise. Arrhythmias also can occur for no known reason.","Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. He or she will ask about your heart and health history. Your doctor will do tests. This includes an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). During this test, you will lie down and the doctor will monitor your heartbeat.

Your doctor may do an exercise or stress test. This consists of monitoring your heart while you walk on a treadmill. You may be given medications to speed up your heartbeat. This can help detect underlying heart disease.

Another way to track your heart is to wear a machine called a Holter monitor. It records your heart’s rhythms for 24 hours. If your doctor wants to monitor your heart for more than 24 hours, he or she may give you an event recorder. It records samples of your heart’s rhythms for a couple of days or more. The doctor may run other tests to provide information about your heart.",You can prevent some types of arrhythmias with lifestyle changes. Limit alcohol use and stop smoking. Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise. Work with your doctor to manage heart disease or other health problems.,"Treatment depends on the type of arrhythmia you have. Some mild arrhythmias may not require treatment. Other types can be treated with medicine. Severe cases require additional treatment, including:

• Artificial pacemaker. The electronic device is placed under the skin on your chest. It helps your heart maintain a regular beat.
• Cardiac defibrillation. A brief electric shock can stop an abnormal rhythm and restore a normal one.
• Procedures to correct certain types of arrhythmias. If the arrhythmia occurs in a certain area of your heart, that part may be removed. A procedure called cardiac ablation can destroy the tissue in your heart that causes the arrhythmia.

Arrhythmias caused by health problems should be properly treated and managed.","People who have mild cases may require monitoring, but no other forms of treatment. For severe cases, treatment can manage your symptoms and heart rate to reduce damage. If your condition is left untreated, it can cause a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure. Follow your doctor’s orders and maintain a healthy lifestyle.","• What kind of arrhythmia do I have? Is it life-threatening?

27,Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC),https://familydoctor.org/condition/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-dysplasia/,"It is most common in people younger than 35 years of age, but it can happen at any age.

The heart has 4 sections called chambers. The right ventricle is one of the lower chambers. If you have ARVC, a genetic defect causes muscle cells in your ventricle wall to die. They are replaced by fat and scar tissue. This can cause abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).","If you have ARVC, you may notice that your heart often beats very fast. You may feel like your heart is skipping a beat or that you can’t catch your breath. This condition sometimes causes chest pain that may seem like a heart attack.

• Lightheadedness
• Fainting
• Shortness of breath with activity
• Swelling of the legs, ankles, and feet

You should see your doctor right away if you have any of these problems. Your doctor can test you for ARVC and other heart problems.","ARVC is a genetic condition. It is caused by mutations in some of your genes. It can be passed down in families. If you have a close relative who died before the age of 40 from heart-related problems, you may be at risk for ARVC or other cardiac condition. This could be a brother, sister, or parent.","There is no single test for ARVC. Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will probably order several cardiac (heart) tests. These could include:

• An electrocardiogram (ECG)
• A signal averaged ECG (SAECG)
• An exercise stress test
• An echocardiogram
• A cardiac MRI
• A 24-hour portable heart monitor

Your doctor can use the results of these tests, your exam, and your family history to make a diagnosis.","ARVC is a genetic, hereditary condition. It cannot be prevented or avoided.","There is currently no cure for ARVC. Treatment involves controlling abnormal heartbeats and managing signs of heart failure. Your doctor may give you medicine (called an antiarrhythmic) to keep your heart beating at a normal rate.

You might need an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This small device monitors your heart’s rhythm and can give an electric shock to the heart if necessary. This will return it to a normal beating pattern.

Sometimes your doctor can do a study that determines which area of the heart is causing the abnormal rhythm. He or she can then eliminate (ablate) these areas. But ARVC is progressive, which means it continues to get worse as you get older. So this procedure does not permanently cure the condition.

A person with severe ARVC could need a heart transplant. But this is rarely necessary.","ARVC needs to be monitored and controlled closely by your doctor. Many people diagnosed with the condition get an ICD. This will require you to have regular check-ups. You will also need yearly cardiac testing. It is a progressive disease, so it will continue to get worse as you get older. But when it is controlled with medicine and an ICD, you can live a normal life.","• Do any of my family members need to be tested for ARVC?
• What is the best treatment option for me? Will I need medicine? Surgery? A pacemaker?
• How does ARVC affect my life expectancy?

28,Asperger's Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/aspergers-syndrome/,"Asperger’s syndrome (also known as just Asperger’s) is a developmental disorder. It is one form of the autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (ASD). It causes impaired language and communication skills as well as repetitive or restrictive thinking and behavior.

People diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome typically have high intelligence and no speech delays. However, they tend to play, learn, speak, and act differently from others.","Children may appear to show signs of Asperger’s syndrome at an early age. Signs your child may have Asperger’s syndrome include:

• Obsessing over a single interest.
• Craving repetition and routine (and not responding well to change).
• Missing social cues in play and conversation.
• Not making eye contact with peers and adults.
• Not understanding abstract thinking.

Your child also may have trouble with pretend play, not want to be held or touched, or have unusual reactions to noises, smells, or tastes. These things may be noticeable to your child’s doctor, teacher, and even to you as a parent. See your doctor if you suspect your child’s communication and social skills are not developing appropriately. Your doctor may refer you to a developmental specialist.","No one thing causes Asperger’s syndrome. However, research suggests that certain factors during pregnancy and after birth may put a child at higher risk of an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Those factors include:

• A chromosomal abnormality (such as fragile X syndrome).
• A mother’s use of prescription medicines taken during pregnancy (such as valproic acid for seizures or mood disorders, or thalidomide for anxiety).
• Having been born to older parents.

This type of autism spectrum disorder appears to be diagnosed more often in boys than girls.",Doctors are able to diagnose this Asperger’s syndrome in children as young as 18 months old. There is no blood test or medical imaging scan to diagnose the condition. Doctors compare a child’s behavior and development to a milestone checklist against same-age peers.,"Because the cause of autism spectrum disorder is unknown, there is no way to prevent or avoid it.","Early and regular treatment can help your child cope with the symptoms related to Asperger’s syndrome. It can prepare him or her for adult life. Treatment usually includes a mix of speech, physical, occupational, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The therapy team will decide how often it needs to work with your child. Therapy sessions might look like this:

• Social skills and speech therapy: Your child may speak well. However, he or she may need to learn important conversation skills. Those skills include learning to take turns while talking, making eye contact with the other person, showing interest in what the person says, and learning to talk about a variety of topics, not obsessing over one topic. The therapist also might teach appropriate playtime skills, such as taking turns, following rules, and learning to cope with one’s emotions around others.
• Physical therapy: Some people diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome may appear clumsy. A physical therapist works to develop a person’s core body strength. This will help with running, jumping, pedaling a bike, walking up and down stairs, and other physical movement activities.
• Occupational therapy: An occupational therapist helps people with Asperger’s syndrome with their fine motor skills (anything requiring the use of their hands). They also work to help your child cope with sensory issues. A person diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome may be sensitive to certain sensory experiences. This might include noise, touch, smell, or visual stimuli. It might include certain materials, such as modeling clay, chalk, sand, and water. It could include sensory issues related to eating different types of food and textures. Your child’s therapist also will work on hand-eye coordination and teach your child to feed him or herself appropriately. Before your child starts school, an occupational therapist will develop your child’s pre-writing hand strength. Once your child enters school, the therapist will help him or her develop handwriting skills.
• Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) teaches people with Asperger’s syndrome how to act socially and cope with their emotions. It teaches important skills such as controlling impulses, fears, anxiety, obsessions, interrupting, and tantrums. It’s different for every person, based on his or her needs.
• Medicine: There is no medicine to treat Asperger’s syndrome. Most medicines treat the anxiety, depression, or inability to focus related to Asperger’s syndrome. Commonly prescribed medicines for anxiety and depression include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotic medicine, and stimulant medicines.

Don’t ignore your child’s early social and communication delays. Asperger’s syndrome behaviors will not improve on their own without therapy. As your child progresses through school, therapy may change to reflect your child’s needs at the time. More importantly, ask your therapists how to apply the therapy at home. Children do best when therapy is the same at school and home.

Therapy is not a one-time treatment. Repetitive therapy helps your child develop appropriate behavior. Children should not be punished for inappropriate behavior. Instead, therapists use incentives and rewards (giving your child extra free time, a healthy snack, or something that is important to them) to encourage appropriate behavior.","If your child was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome or ASD, developing relationships for him or her will take practice and effort. A person diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome may not display appropriate emotions (or any emotion), may not understand the irony in a joke, vague concepts, or the simple points of a conversation. Peers may feel like their behavior is eccentric.

Although Asperger’s syndrome or ASD cannot be cured, therapy can help. Your child can be successful at school and in their adult life. Many employers say that the focus and attention a person with Asperger’s syndrome or ASD gives to his or her job is a good thing. Adults diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome or ASD may continue to need therapy or counseling to teach appropriate personal and workplace behavior.","• Is Asperger’s syndrome genetic?
• Should I tell my child he or she has Asperger’s syndrome/ASD when he or she is older?
• Is Asperger’s syndrome/ASD associated with violent or self-injurious behavior?
• How can I cope with the stress of raising a child with Asperger’s syndrome/ASD?","MedlinePlus: Autism Spectrum Disorder – Asperger Syndrome

29,Asthma,https://familydoctor.org/condition/asthma/,"Asthma is a chronic (long-term) disease of the lungs. It inflames and narrows the airways, making it harder to breathe. These are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. It most often starts in childhood but can affect people of all ages.

The airways of people who have asthma are extra sensitive to the things they’re allergic to (allergens). They are also sensitive to certain substances that can be inhaled through the air.

Asthma symptoms start when irritants cause the lining of the airways to become inflamed (swollen) and narrow. The muscles around the airways can then spasm (contract rapidly). This causes the airways to narrow even more. When the lining of the airways is inflamed, it produces more mucus. The mucus clogs the airways and further blocks the flow of air. When these symptoms are severe and not easily controlled, it’s called an “asthma attack.”","An asthma “flare up,” or attack, happens when excess mucus causes your air tubes to swell and tighten. Asthma attacks can be mild, moderate, or severe. Symptoms of an asthma attack include the following:

• Coughing. Coughing from asthma is usually worse early in the morning and at night. This can lead to problems sleeping.
• Tightness in the chest. You may feel breathless and like something is squeezing your chest.
• Wheezing. A hoarse, squeaky, musical, or whistling sound when you breathe.
• Coughing with mucus.

Severe asthma attacks can be life threatening. Call your doctor right away if you experience any or all of the following issues. He or she may want you to seek emergency care right away.

• Your rescue medicine doesn’t relieve your symptoms.
• Your fingernails or lips turn gray or blue.
• You have trouble walking or talking.
• You have extreme difficulty breathing.
• Your neck, chest, or ribs are pulled in with each breath.
• Your nostrils flare when you breathe.
• Your heartbeat or pulse is very fast.","An exact cause of asthma has not been determined. Scientists and researchers think that genetic and environmental causes lead to asthma. These may include:

• One or both parents have asthma.
• A genetic history of allergies in the family.
• Having certain respiratory infections during childhood.
• Contact with allergens or infections during infancy and early childhood, when the immune system is still developing.

Many things can cause your asthma to flare up, including:

• allergies
• viral infections (such as a cold) and sinus infections
• tobacco
• air pollutants (such as wood smoke)
• cold air
• exercise
• perfume or chemical fumes
• heartburn

For some people, strong emotions or stress can trigger an asthma attack. Pay attention to the way these things affect your asthma. Work with your doctor to figure out which things bother your asthma.","Your doctor will ask you for your medical history, especially any family history of allergies and asthma. Keep a record of your asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Your doctor will want to know what seems to trigger and worsen your symptoms.

He or she will perform a physical exam. They will listen to your breathing and look for signs of allergies and asthma. These can include wheezing, swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema).

They will conduct a spirometry test. You will breathe into a machine called a spirometer to see how well your lungs work. It records the amount of air and how quickly you breathe in and out. Your doctor may need to perform other tests, such as:

• Allergy testing.
• Tests to rule out other conditions with symptoms similar to asthma. These could include sleep apnea or reflux disease.
• Chest X-ray or EKG (electrocardiogram) to make sure there is nothing else in your lungs (a disease or foreign object) that is causing the symptoms.","Asthma cannot be prevented, and there is no cure. You can help avoid asthma attacks by avoiding the triggers that can start an asthma attack. Examples of common allergens and irritants include:

• air pollution
• pollen
• tobacco smoke
• pet dander
• exercise
• changes in temperature
• certain foods
• sulfite (food preservative in red wine, beer, salad bars, dehydrated soups, and other foods)
• heartburn
• strong emotions (such as crying or laughing)
• perfume
• colds and viruses","Your doctor will work with you to create an action plan to control your asthma. The plan will include recognizing your symptoms and avoiding your asthma triggers. It will give guidance on taking medicines properly. Your plan will help you track your level and control and know when to seek emergency care when needed.

Your doctor may have you use a peak flow meter to track your symptoms. A peak flow meter is a handheld device that measures your peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). This is how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. Measuring your peak flow regularly can help you tell whether your asthma is getting worse.

Asthma medicines are divided into two groups: controller medicines (to prevent attacks) and rescue medicines (to treat attacks). Your doctor will talk to you about these medicines and what to do if you have an asthma attack. Ask your doctor for written instructions about how to take your medicines. The following are examples of medicines most commonly used by people who have asthma:

Controller Medicines (to prevent attacks, usually taken daily)

• inhaled corticosteroids
• combination inhalers
• leukotriene modifiers

Quick-Relief Medicines (to treat an attack, usually only taken when an attack occurs)

• albuterol, pirbuterol, levalbuterol, or bitolterol
• ipratropium
• oral steroids (prednisone, prednisolone)","With the treatments available today, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. They may have few symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma.

Treating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care. They can even be fatal.","• Would allergy testing help determine what is causing asthma symptoms?
• What changes can I make at home to relieve my/my child’s asthma symptoms?
• Is it safe to exercise and/or play sports with asthma?
• Will my child grow out of his/her asthma?
• What information do I need to give my child’s school about his/her treatment?","American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology: Asthma

30,Asthma in Kids,https://familydoctor.org/condition/asthma-in-kids/,"Asthma is a disease that often starts in childhood. Asthma makes it difficult for your child’s lungs to get air. That makes it hard for your child to breathe. Asthma happens when your lungs become irritated and fill with mucus.

If your child has asthma, they may:

• Be short of breath (with or without activity)
• Have a tight feeling (or pain) in their chest
• Have difficulty sleeping (because asthma","symptoms are worse at night, when you are lying down)
• Have a noticeable wheezing sound as they breathe
• Have a persistent cough

The more frequent the symptoms, the more serious the disease.","No one knows what causes asthma. However, we know plenty about what triggers an asthma attack. People with asthma are commonly sensitive to:

• Tobacco smoke
• Smoke from burning wood
• Dust mites
• Outdoor pollution
• Cockroaches
• Some foods
• Certain medicines

• Physical exercise
• Upper respiratory viruses
• Acid reflux (when fluid from your stomach backs up into your throat)
• Sleep apnea (when you stop breathing for short periods while sleeping)
• Sinus infection
• Weather (changing temperatures, muggy conditions, rain)
• Stress
• Becoming overly excited

Newer research suggests that asthma is tied to obesity (being significantly overweight).","Your doctor will perform a physical exam on your child. They will look at your child’s medical history and perform a breathing test called spirometry. Spirometry measures how much air you breathe out after taking a deep breath. It is painless and can be done in the doctor’s office. Your doctor will give your child a disposable mouthpiece that attaches to a tube. That tube attaches to a machine that records their breathing. There is usually an image on the machine’s screen, such as birthday candles or a wall of bricks. As your child exhales, the candles will go out (or the bricks will fall down). Your child will be asked to repeat the test more than once during their doctor’s visit to get accurate results. Your doctor will likely give your child a dose of an inhaled prescription medicine that opens up their airway for the test.

Other, more involved tests may include:

• The exercise challenge (exercising on a treadmill or stationary bike while doing a breathing test)
• An exhaled nitric oxide test (breathing into a special device that measures how much of the gas nitric oxide is in your breath — high levels of the gas are present in people with asthma)
• Allergy testing (skin and blood tests to determine what you are allergic to)","Asthma cannot be prevented. However, your child can reduce their asthma attacks by learning their triggers and avoiding them. For example, limit your child’s exposure to pets and cigarette smoke, and have them stay indoors on days when air pollution is bad. Avoid wearing strong perfume or cologne around your child. Strong smells can trigger an asthma attack.","There is no cure for asthma. It can often be a lifelong condition. However, you can improve your child’s quality of life by knowing and avoiding their triggers, reminding them to take their prescription medicine, and following the written asthma plan their doctor gives them. The plan gives details on their triggers and what to do if they feel the start of an attack.

There are two types of asthma medicines. The first are maintenance medicines (taken daily to keep their asthma under control). The second are quick-acting medicines (usually in the form of an inhaler to bring them immediate relief when they have an asthma attack). Some people take their medicine with a nebulizer. A nebulizer changes liquid medicine into a fine mist that is inhaled through a mask or mouthpiece. Your doctor will determine which is best for your child.","Living with asthma as a child can be difficult. An asthma attack can interfere with physical activity (playtime and sports), sleep, and cause children to miss school or be hospitalized. Teach your child to recognize their asthma triggers and to plan for those triggers if they can’t avoid them. Also, teach your child to keep their quick-acting medicine nearby in the event of an asthma attack. With proper monitoring and medicine, your child can enjoy a full and active life.","• Can my child outgrow asthma?

31,Atherosclerosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/atherosclerosis/,"Atherosclerosis causes plaque to collect in your arteries. (Plaque is made of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other things naturally found in your blood. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body.) The plaque hardens, making your arteries narrow. Sometimes arteries become completely blocked with plaque. This limits how much blood can flow to the rest of your body.

Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease. It’s a slow disease that may get worse as you get older. It’s sometimes called “hardening of the arteries.”","Many people don’t know they have atherosclerosis until they have a medical emergency caused when blood can’t get through the arteries. This can cause chest pain, breathing difficulties, and stroke. Some people also have issues with their kidneys, intestines, and legs.","Doctors don’t know what causes atherosclerosis. However, it may first develop when the inner layers of your arteries become damaged. Many things can cause this damage, including:

• High blood pressure
• High cholesterol
• Diabetes
• Obesity or being overweight
• Smoking and tobacco use
• Unhealthy diet
• Lack of exercise
• Family history of heart disease","Your doctor will talk with you about your family history. They also will do a physical exam. This exam may include listening to your heart or other areas of high blood flow. Certain sounds may indicate you have a problem with blood flowing through your arteries. Your doctor also may check your pulse in your leg or foot. This will show them how well your blood is traveling through your arteries. If they feel a weak pulse or no pulse in one of those areas, it may mean you have a blocked artery.

Your doctor may order tests to check for atherosclerosis. These may include:

• This uses dye and X-rays to show the inside of your arteries.
• Blood tests.These check what is in your blood, including cholesterol.
• Chest X-ray.This takes a picture of the inside of your chest.
• CT scan.This takes digital pictures of your heart.
• This takes a picture of your heart as it’s moving.
• Electrocardiogram (EKG).This test checks the beats and rhythm of your heart.
• Stress test. This monitors your heart as you exercise.","An important way to prevent atherosclerosis is by living a healthy lifestyle. Maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet, and exercise. These changes may help you lose weight (if necessary), lower your LDL “bad” cholesterol, increase your HDL “good” cholesterol, and lower your blood pressure. They may also help control your blood sugar, which is important if you have diabetes.

If you smoke, stop smoking. This is the most important step you can take to decrease your risk of atherosclerosis.

Your doctor has a way to calculate your risk of developing atherosclerosis based on your age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other factors. If you’re at higher risk, your doctor may recommend you take a statin. Statins are medicines that slow down your body’s production of cholesterol. They also remove cholesterol buildup from your arteries.","Your doctor will likely recommend lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and exercise, to treat atherosclerosis. If those don’t work, they may prescribe medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. For example, if you are 50 to 59 years of age and have a high risk for heart disease, your doctor may want you to take a low dose of aspirin each day. Aspirin helps keep your blood from forming clots that can clog your arteries. However, it isn’t appropriate for everyone. Don’t start taking aspirin without talking to your doctor first.

If you have severe atherosclerosis or have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, your doctor may recommend a procedure to open your blocked arteries or surgery to go around (bypass) the blockage.","Living a healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of atherosclerosis.

• Eat a heart-healthy diet. A heart-healthy diet includes a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meats, and “good” fats. A Mediterranean diet is an example of a heart-healthy diet.
• Exercise. This can help you lose weight if you’re overweight or have obesity. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight. Exercise helps raise your HDL cholesterol and lower your LDL cholesterol. Try to work up to an average of 40 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity 3 to 4 times a week. Talk to your doctor before starting an exercise plan.
• Quit smoking. Smoking can damage your blood vessels, reduce the flow of blood through them, and lower your HDL cholesterol. Even exposure to secondhand smoke can affect your blood vessels and cholesterol. Talk to your doctor about developing a plan to help you stop smoking.
• Manage stress. Try to reduce your stress. You can do that by deep breathing and relaxation techniques. Examples include meditation and gentle exercise (such as walking or yoga). Also talking with a friend, family member, or health care professional may be helpful.","• Am I at risk for atherosclerosis?
• What changes can I make to reduce my risk?

32,Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behaviors. It used to also be called attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADHD is common in children and adults. People who have ADHD have trouble paying attention in school, at home, or at work. Even when they try to concentrate, they find it hard to pay attention. Children who have ADHD may be more active or impulsive than what is typical for their age. These behaviors cause problems in friendships, learning, and behavior. For this reason, children who have ADHD are sometimes seen as being “difficult” or as having behavior problems.

Most of what we hear about ADHD is how it affects children. Not as much is known about the way ADHD affects adults. Adults who have ADHD often are diagnosed when they find out their children have ADHD. For adults to be diagnosed, they must have developed symptoms prior to age 12. ADHD may run in families. Hyperactivity is more common in boys. However, other symptoms (especially inattention) are more common in girls. Some people who have ADHD may have other conditions as well. These could include learning disabilities, anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), bipolar disorder, and Tourette syndrome. Also, these conditions can be mistaken for ADHD, so it is important to work with health care professionals for a diagnosis.","People who have ADHD have difficulty organizing things, listening to instructions, remembering details, and/or controlling their behavior. This can make it difficult to get along with other people at home, at school, or at work.

A person with ADHD who has difficulty paying attention will have 6 or more of the following symptoms:

• Difficulty following instructions
• Difficulty keeping attention on work or play activities at school, work, and home
• Losing things needed for activities at school, work, and home
• Appearing not to listen
• Doesn’t pay close attention to details
• Seems disorganized
• Trouble with tasks that require planning ahead
• Forgetting things
• Is easily distracted

A person with ADHD who is hyperactive or impulsive will have at least 6 of the following symptoms:

• Fidgety
• Runs or climbs inappropriately
• Can’t play quietly
• Blurts out answers
• Interrupts people
• Can’t stay in seat
• Talks too much
• Is always on the go
• Has trouble waiting his or her turn","People who have ADHD do not make enough chemicals in certain areas in the brain that are important for organizing thoughts. Without enough of these chemicals, the organizing centers of the brain don’t work well. This is thought to be the cause of ADHD. The shortage of chemicals may be due to a person’s genes (research shows that ADHD is more common in people who have a close family member with the disorder), environment, or physical development. Recent research also links smoking and other substance abuse during pregnancy to ADHD. Exposure to environmental toxins, such as lead, also can be a factor.

ADHD is not caused by eating sugary foods.","A doctor will be better able to diagnose ADHD when getting information about your child’s behavior. It may take information from several people who know your child (teachers, daycare providers). Your doctor also may have forms or checklists that you and your child’s teacher can complete. This will help you and your doctor compare your child’s behavior with other children’s behavior.

Unfortunately, many people try to diagnose themselves by using a quiz or a checklist they find in a magazine or see on TV. However, it’s best to see your doctor. Some of the questions your doctor may ask you or about your child include:

• Do you have problems paying attention and with hyperactivity? Have you had these problems since you were a child?
• Do you have a hard time keeping your temper or staying in a good mood?
• Do you have problems staying organized or being on time?
• Do these problems happen to you at school, work and at home?
• Do family members and friends see that you have problems in these areas?
• Do you have any physical or mental health problems that might affect your behavior? (Your doctor may give you a physical exam and do tests to see if you have any medical problems with symptoms that are like ADHD.)

Your doctor will probably want to test your child’s vision and hearing if these tests haven’t been done recently. A person diagnosed with ADHD will have had symptoms for at least 6 months.

Also, it might be hard for your doctor to tell if your child has ADHD. Many children who have ADHD aren’t hyperactive in the doctor’s office. Your doctor may ask you to fill out a questionnaire regarding your child’s behavior patterns. Eventually, your doctor may want your child to see someone who specializes in children’s behavior.

The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that any child 4 through 18 years of age should be evaluated for ADHD if they have academic or behavioral problems, and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.","ADHD cannot be prevented or avoided. However, doctors believe that avoiding smoking and substance abuse during pregnancy can lower the baby’s risk of developing ADHD. Still, there’s no guarantee that doing everything right during pregnancy will protect a baby from developing ADHD. Additionally, exposure to environmental toxins, such as lead, also can be a risk factor for ADHD.","Some of the medicines used to treat ADHD are called psychostimulants. They include methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, and a drug that combines dextroamphetamine and amphetamine. These medicines have a stimulating effect in most people. However, they have a calming effect in people who have ADHD. These medicines improve attention and concentration and decrease impulsive and overactive behaviors. Your doctor may consider other non-stimulant medicines, such as atomoxetine, clonidine, desipramine, imipramine, and bupropion.

All medicines have side effects. Psychostimulants may decrease your appetite and cause a stomachache or a headache. The loss of appetite can cause weight loss in some people. This side effect seems to be more common in children. Some people have insomnia (trouble sleeping). Other possible side effects include fast heartbeat, chest pain, or vomiting. To avoid or reduce the side effects of psychostimulants, follow these tips:

• Use the lowest possible dose that still controls the hyperactivity or inattention. Your doctor will work with you to find the right dose.
• Take the medicine with food if it bothers your stomach.
• Ask your doctor if you can skip the medicines on the weekends.
• Offer healthy snacks to children who lose weight while taking medicine for ADHD.
• Take the medicine 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Lunchtime doses can be given at school for some children. If your child can’t take this medicine at school, tell your doctor. They might suggest a long-acting form of the medicine instead. If you are taking the long-acting form of this medicine, do not crush, break, or chew it before swallowing it.

It’s important to take the medicine the way your doctor prescribes it. Follow your doctor’s advice, even if you think the medicine isn’t working. Medicines used to treat ADHD have been shown to improve a person’s ability to do specific tasks. This includes paying attention or having more self-control. The length of time a person will need to take medicine depends on each person. Some people only need to take medicine for 1 to 2 years. Others need treatment for many more years. In some people, ADHD may continue into adolescence and adulthood.

People who have ADHD should be checked regularly by their doctors. If your child has ADHD, your doctor may suggest that they take a break from their medicines once in a while to see if the medicine is still necessary. School breaks or summer vacation might be best.

AAFP suggests several treatment recommendations. Preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age) should be treated with behavior therapy as the first line of treatment. The medicine methylphenidate may be prescribed if behavior treatment does not provide significant improvement. Your doctor may recommend this medicine if ADHD is interfering with the child’s friendships, home, and school life at a moderate to severe level. Elementary school-aged children (6-11 years of age) may benefit from FDA-approved medicine for ADHD and behavioral therapy. Adolescents (12-18 years of age) are more likely to benefit from treatment with FDA-approved medicine but should also incorporate behavioral therapy to help build and maintain organizational skills. In all cases, medicine doses should be measured and adjusted to achieve maximum benefit with few adverse effects.","Symptoms of ADHD often get better as children grow older and learn to adjust. Hyperactivity usually stops in the late teenage years. But about half of children who have ADHD continue to be easily distracted, have mood swings, hot tempers, and are unable to complete tasks. Children who have loving, supportive parents or guardians who work together with school staff, mental health workers, and their doctor have the best chance of becoming well-adjusted adults.

Children who have ADHD may be difficult to parent. They may have trouble understanding directions. Their constant state of activity can be challenging for adults. Some children benefit from counseling or from structured therapy. Families may benefit from talking with a specialist in managing ADHD-related behavior and learning problems.

Children who have ADHD also tend to need more structure and clearer expectations. You may need to change your home life a bit to help your child. Here are some things you can do to help:

• Make a schedule.
• Make simple house rules.
• Make sure your directions are understood.
• Reward good behavior.
• Make sure your child is supervised all the time.
• Watch your child around his or her friends.
• Set a homework routine.
• Focus on effort, not grades.
• Talk with your child’s teachers.

If your child has ADHD, it is a good idea to work with their school to help them be more successful. This could include putting together an individualized education plan (IEP) for your child or a 504 plan. These plans ensure that your child is receiving any accommodations they may need to help them learn in the most appropriate environment.

If your doctor thinks you have ADHD as an adult, he or she may suggest counseling. Your doctor also may recommend testing and counseling with someone who specializes in treating ADHD. You can learn ways to change your work environment and keep distractions to a minimum. Organizational tools can help you learn how to focus on activities at work and at home. Many people who have ADHD find counseling helpful. A lifetime of ADHD behaviors and problems can cause low self-esteem and problems with relationships. Individual counseling and support groups may help you with these problems.","• Why does my child have attention and hyperactivity problems at home, but not at school?

33,Autism,https://familydoctor.org/condition/autism/,"Autism is a developmental brain disorder. It affects your social, behavioral, and communication skills. People who have autism start showing signs at an early age. Autism levels vary from person to person. Because of this, doctors often refer to autism as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). People who have mild symptoms may be considered “high-functioning.”

What used to be called Asperger’s syndrome (AS) is the most common ASD. It is a form of “high-functioning” autism. Typically, people who have what was formerly known as AS have a normal-to-high IQ. They may exhibit a special skill or area of interest. Their verbal language development is considered normal. However, people who have AS can have trouble using language correctly in social situations. They often have a hard time with nonverbal communication, such as making eye contact, reading facial expressions, and using body gestures. General social skills, such as developing relationships and adjusting to change, also can be affected. People who have AS can learn these skills through behavior and communication therapy.","People with autism can have a range of symptoms. Some are common, and some depend on the severity of the disorder. Your child may:

• Avoid physical touch or eye contact
• Not respond to voices or other sounds
• Not respond to someone calling their name
• Not talk
• Not understand hand gestures or body language
• Rock back and forth, spin, or bang their head
• Stare at part of an object, such as the wheels of a toy car
• Fixate on certain topics or things
• Not pretend or play make-believe games
• Be concerned with order, routine, or ritual and become upset if it is disturbed or changed
• Have a flat facial expression and/or use a monotone voice
• Be unafraid of danger and accidentally cause injuries
• Not seem interested in playing with others

Approximately 20% of children who have autism develop normally for the first 1 to 2 years of their lives. Then, they experience what doctors call a regression. This means that they lose skills that they had before, such as the ability to talk.

However, some autistic children gain special skills. For example, they may be able to do complex math problems in their heads. Abilities like these are less common.","Doctors are not sure what causes autism. Some studies suggest that it is genetic (runs in families). Certain health problems or things in your child’s environment may play a role. Kids who are born to older parents have an increased risk of autism. Boys are more likely to have autism than girls. In most cases, the cause of a child’s autism is not known. As doctors continue to study autism, they may learn more about what causes it.

Vaccines do not cause autism. This includes the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Vaccines are an important part of your child’s health. If you have concerns about the safety of vaccines, talk to your doctor.","There is no lab test that can detect autism. Talk to your doctor if your child does not behave as expected for their age. If the doctor suspects autism, they may suggest seeing a child psychiatrist or other pediatric specialist. A specialist can observe your child to look for signs of autism.

Some children who have autism also have an intellectual disability. This means that their intellectual abilities function well below average. It causes developmental delays in reading, writing, and math, for example. This can make it hard to diagnose autism. Children with autism do not respond to questions the same way other kids do. An expert can give your child special tests to learn more about your child’s condition.","More children are being diagnosed with autism. It is not clear if this means that more children have autism. It may mean that parents, doctors, and teachers are better at recognizing the signs of autism.","Children do not “outgrow” autism, and there is no cure. Medicine alone cannot treat autism. It can help manage some symptoms, such as aggression or sleeplessness. Research shows that some children benefit from intense behavior and language therapy. The earlier the therapy starts, the better the results. With therapy, your child’s symptoms may improve as they get older. Talk to your doctor about what kind of treatment is best for your child.","People who have autism can live normal, healthy lives. They may see and react to things in different ways. They may have a harder time paying attention. As a parent, you may need to find other ways to teach and connect with your child. Work with the doctor or specialist to improve your child’s lifestyle. This could mean creating routines or habits, so your child feels safe and relaxed. It is important to do this at a young age. It can help your child cope better when they become an adult.

Ask your doctor to recommend a counselor or support group. This can help you, your child, and the whole family.","• What can I do to help my child develop language skills?

34,Avian Flu (Bird Flu),https://familydoctor.org/condition/avian-flu/,"Avian flu (also called Avian influenza A or bird flu) is a virus that is spread from bird to bird. In rare cases, certain strains of the virus can transform into a human virus and spread to people. Most people who get infected with bird flu have close contact with infected birds or bird droppings. It is mostly a problem in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Europe.

According to the CDC, in 2024, sporadic cases of a serious bird flu virus have been found in animals in the United States, Canada, and other countries, but the risk to most people is still low. The H5 bird flu is common in wild birds and is causing problems for poultry and dairy cows in the U.S. There have been a few cases of people getting sick from a different type of bird flu, but the illness was not severe.","Symptoms usually appear 2 to 7 days after exposure. They are similar to what you experience with seasonal flu. Common symptoms include:

• Fever
• Sore throat
• Cough
• Achy muscles
• Headache
• Pink eye (conjunctivitis)

More serious symptoms can include:

• Severe respiratory problems (shortness of breath, trouble breathing, pneumonia, serious respiratory distress, and respiratory failure)
• Abdominal pain
• Nausea and vomiting
• Diarrhea

In some cases, avian flu can cause mental confusion and seizures. At its worst, it can lead to death.

As with any flu virus, some people have higher risk of developing a serious illness. These include:

• Pregnant women
• People with weakened immune systems
• Seniors age 65 or older","The disease is mainly caused by direct contact with an infected bird. This could be through touching or plucking. It is also caused by contact with an infected bird’s saliva or its droppings. This includes swimming in water contaminated with bird droppings. It can also spread if you touch the surface of where an infected bird has been.

The virus spreads when your contaminated hands touch your nose, eyes, or mouth. The virus can also be inhaled through small moisture droplets or dust particles. It can only be passed from human to human if it transforms into a human flu virus. This is rare.

It is also possible to get the virus from undercooked meat or eggs from infected birds. Meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165° F. Eggs should be cooked until the whites and the yolks are firm.

Your risk of getting bird flu is higher if:

• You work with poultry.
• You travel to areas where the virus is present.
• You touch an infected bird.
• You go into a building that has infected birds or droppings from infected birds.
• You eat raw or undercooked meat or eggs from infected birds.",Avian flu is commonly diagnosed during a visit to the doctor. Your doctor will examine you and ask you questions about your symptoms. They will ask you about recent events that may have put you in contact with a contaminated bird or human. Lab tests are needed to confirm the virus. Your doctor will take a sample of mucus from your nose or the back of your throat with a long cotton swab. That swab will be sent to the lab for testing.,"The best way to avoid the virus is to avoid direct contact with birds in high-risk areas. This includes when traveling to the countries most affected and visiting live-animal markets. Avoiding contact with a human known to have the virus also is a good way to avoid illness. As with all viruses, regular hand washing is the best way to control your exposure. If you can’t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with your hands. If possible, use a tissue to cover a cough or sneeze.

If you know you have the disease, do not expose others at work, school, and the community. Try to separate yourself from the rest of your family at home. People who work with live poultry should follow their work safety guidelines.

Because Avian flu is rare, a vaccine to prevent it is not available to the public. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a vaccine they are storing in case the disease becomes widespread in the U.S.","Some antiviral prescription medicines can lessen or shorten the symptoms of the virus. However, they won’t prevent or eliminate the virus. Doctors treat the symptoms by recommending over-the-counter medicines, extra fluids, and rest. For more serious symptoms, you may need to stay in the hospital. Hospitalization could involve intravenous fluids (given through a small needle inserted into your vein) and breathing treatments.",Living with avian flu may mean a week or two of living with mild symptoms that get better over time. Rest and fluids will help.,"• Should I be concerned about catching avian flu if I plan to travel to one of the affected countries?

35,Babesiosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/babesiosis/,"Babesiosis is an infection of the red blood cells. It is caused by a single-cell parasite called Babesia. The parasite is carried by deer ticks, the same ticks that carry Lyme disease.

Babesiosis infections in humans used to be rare, but the number of cases is increasing. Most reported infections are in the northeastern states and the upper Midwest.","Symptoms of babesiosis usually start 1 to 8 weeks after you are bitten by a tick. Some people may not have any symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are often similar to symptoms of the flu:

• Fever (as high as 104°F)
• Chills
• Sweating
• Weakness
• Fatigue
• Joint and muscle aches
• Loss of appetite
• Headache

In young, healthy adults, the infection usually isn’t severe. But the illness can quickly become serious and can even cause death. Babesiosis could be life-threatening in people who:

• Are elderly
• Have had their spleen removed
• Have liver or kidney disease
• Have weak immune systems (due to conditions such as HIV/AIDS or cancer)
• Are transplant recipients","People get babesiosis when an infected tick bites them. The Babesia parasite is usually spread when the tick is in its nymph (pre-adult) stage. At that stage, the tick is the size of a poppy seed. It can be hard to detect a tick this small.

Ticks live in areas with a lot of plant life, such as wooded areas or fields. They sit near the top of grassy plants and low bushes. They wait there for people or animals to brush up against them. Ticks can crawl on your clothes or body for several hours before attaching to the skin.

Ticks can attach to any part of your body. They are usually found in hard-to-see areas, including the armpits, groin, or scalp. An infected tick needs to be attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours before it passes the parasite on to you.

People who spend time in outdoor areas where ticks are common are at higher risk of getting tick-borne diseases.

Though rare, it is possible to get babesiosis through a blood transfusion. It is also possible for an infected mother to pass the parasite to her baby. This can happen during pregnancy or delivery. This is also rare.

Your doctor will look at a sample of your blood under a microscope. If you have babesiosis, your doctor will be able to see the parasite in your red blood cells. They might test your blood for other infections that could be causing your symptoms. This includes other diseases ticks can carry, such as Lyme disease. It is possible to have more than one tick-borne illness at a time.","It can be hard to detect a tick this small. Ticks live in areas with a lot of plant life, such as wooded areas or fields.

When you are outdoors, follow these guidelines:

• Avoid areas that are wooded, brushy, or have tall grass.
• Walk in the center of trails.
• Use an insect repellent with at least 20% DEET. It can be put on clothing or sparingly on the skin. Don’t apply it to children’s faces or hands.
• Treat clothing, tents, or other gear with repellents containing 0.5% permethrin.
• Wear light-colored clothing. This makes it easier to see and remove ticks from your clothes.
• Wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Tuck your pant legs into your socks or boots for added protection.
• After you get home, check everything and everyone for ticks.
• Bathe or shower as soon as you can to wash off any ticks that have not attached to you.
• Check your entire body for ticks. Use a mirror for places you can’t see. Check your children and your pets. Common tick locations include the back of the knees, groin area, underarms, ears, scalp, and the back of the neck.
• Check any gear you used, including coats, backpacks, or tents.
• Tumble dry clothes or blankets on high heat in the dryer for 10 to 15 minutes. This should kill any ticks. If clothes are dirty, wash them in hot water and dry on high heat for 60 minutes.

During the months of May through September, stay away from places where ticks are common. This is especially important if you have:

• Had your spleen removed
• Had an organ transplant or are taking immunosuppressant medicines (which weaken or suppress the immune system)
• An HIV infection or AIDS
• Any other chronic condition that affects your immune system","What do I do if I find a tick on my skin?

Don’t panic. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grab the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible. Pull up with steady, even pressure. Be careful not to squeeze or twist the tick body. Sometimes parts of the tick remain in the skin. You can leave them alone or carefully remove them the same way you would a splinter. Do not use heat (such as a lit match), petroleum jelly, or other methods to try to make the tick back out on its own. These methods are not effective.

Wash the area where the tick was attached thoroughly with soap and water. Monitor how you’re feeling for the next month or two. Call your doctor if you develop flu-like symptoms. Be sure to tell your doctor that you were bitten by a tick and when it happened.

People who have healthy immune systems and only mild cases of babesiosis usually don’t need treatment. The body fights the infection on its own. People with more severe cases are treated with antibiotics. If you develop shortness of breath or other symptoms during treatment, tell your doctor right away. If you have a severe case of babesiosis or a weak immune system, you may need to go to a hospital.

Many people infected with babesiosis don’t have any symptoms. They don’t even know they have it. Those who experience symptoms can be treated with antibiotics. They usually make a full and complete recovery.

People at risk of a more severe infection could experience complications. The most common is hemolytic anemia. This happens when the Babesia parasite destroys red blood cells faster than the body can make new ones. It can lead to jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and dark urine.

Other complications could include:

• Low or unstable blood pressure
• Low blood platelet count
• Blood clots and bleeding
• Vital organ malfunctions (such as liver, kidneys, or lungs)

If you experience any of these issues, get medical help right away.",null,"• I found a tick embedded in my skin, but I can’t get it out. What should I do?

36,Bacterial Endocarditis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/bacterial-endocarditis/,"Bacterial, or infective, endocarditis (BE) is a type of infection. It occurs in the valves and inner lining of your heart (called the endocardium). BE is not common but can happen if bacteria from another part of your body enter your bloodstream.

BE can be acute or chronic. Acute BE happens quickly and can get worse fast. If left untreated, it can be life threatening. Chronic BE happens over time. It may take weeks or months to notice symptoms.","Fever, chills, and other flu-like symptoms may be signs of acute BE. You also may have a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat. Symptoms of chronic BE can include fatigue and unexplained weight loss.","Although BE can occur in anyone, some people are at greater risk. This includes people who have:

• A diagnosed heart valve problem
• A heart defect or heart murmur
• A past surgery on heart valves
• An artificial heart valve
• A heart transplant
• A history of intravenous drug use (drug use that involves needles)
• A history of endocarditis

If you have one of these factors, talk to your doctor about your risk of BE. Dental work, including a teeth cleaning, and some medical procedures, such as a colonoscopy, can increase the risk of bacteria entering your bloodstream.",Your doctor may suspect you have BE based on your symptoms and health history. They will need to do tests to diagnose it. These include blood tests and an echocardiography (echo). An echo test checks your heart using ultrasound.,"You cannot always prevent BE. However, you should talk to your doctor if you are at risk. If you need to have dental work or a procedure, you may need to take an antibiotic first.

37,Bacterial Vaginosis (BV),https://familydoctor.org/condition/bacterial-vaginosis/,"Bacterial vaginosis is a mild infection in the vagina caused by a type of bacteria (germ). The vagina normally contains a lot of “good” bacteria, called lactobacilli. It also contains a few other types of bacteria, called anaerobes. Too many anaerobes can cause bacterial vaginosis. It is not known why the anaerobe bacteria overgrow and cause this infection.",You may notice a discharge from your vagina. The discharge may be clear or colored. It may be very light or heavy. It may have a fishy smell. This smell may be more intense after you have sexual intercourse. Some women have bacterial vaginosis without any symptoms.,"BV is an overgrowth of bacteria that are normally in the vagina. Researchers do not completely understand why it occurs. However, activities such as douching can put you at greater risk for bacterial vaginosis. So can having a new sexual partner or multiple sexual partners—even though it is not a sexually transmitted infection. BV is more common in women who are sexually active. But it also occurs in women who are not sexually active. It’s not usually necessary for your sex partner to be treated if they come in contact with you.",Your doctor will examine your vagina and use a cotton swab to get a sample of the discharge. This sample will be tested to see if you have too much anaerobe bacteria.,"You may not be able to prevent BV. Your doctor may recommend using things like probiotics. You’ll either take these by mouth or by placing them in your vagina. Other ways to reduce your risk:

• Use condoms. Condoms can help prevent the spread of BV.
• Keep sex toys clean. Do not share sex toys with other people. Always clean them after use.
• Limit your number of sexual partners. Monogamy (having sex with only one partner) is the one of the best ways to prevent BV.
• Do not douche. This can cause an imbalance in vaginal bacteria.
• See your doctor. If you feel you have symptoms of BV, tell your doctor.","BV can be treated in one of several ways. Your doctor may prescribe pills for you to take by mouth. They may also prescribe a cream or gel to put in your vagina. It’s important to use your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you.

If your doctor prescribes metronidazole or other medicines, don’t drink any alcohol while taking the medicine. You should not drink alcohol for 24 hours after taking metronidazole. Combining alcohol with these medicines can cause nausea and vomiting. Even the small amount of alcohol in many cough syrups can cause nausea and vomiting if you’re taking metronidazole. Be sure to tell your doctor about any other medicines you are currently taking.

Medicine can clear up the infection, but it returns again after a few weeks. Some women report that BV returns after their period each month. Or it can return after they have sex. Talk to your doctor if you have chronic BV. Your doctor may suggest certain lifestyle changes that can help, like taking probiotics."
38,Barrett’s Esophagus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/barretts-esophagus/,"Barrett’s esophagus is a condition that affects your esophagus. That’s the tube that food travels down when you eat. It connects your throat to your stomach.

A section of muscles separates your esophagus from your stomach. Its job is to keep acid from your stomach from coming back into your esophagus. If those muscles don’t close the right way, acid goes back into your esophagus. This is known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Over time, this acid can damage the lining of your esophagus. It also can make the tiny cells in your esophagus change. If this happens, it’s called Barrett’s esophagus. Although uncommon, Barrett’s esophagus can lead to cancer.","Barrett’s esophagus doesn’t cause symptoms. Instead, it’s the symptoms of GERD that typically lead your doctor to discovering you have it. That’s why it’s important to tell your doctor if you have GERD 3 or more times a week. Symptoms of GERD include:

• Heartburn.
• A cough.
• Trouble swallowing.
• Pain when you swallow.
• Sudden weight loss.
• Blood in your vomit or bowel movements.
• Bowel movements that look like black tar.","Repeat damage from stomach acid causes Barrett’s esophagus. People who have GERD have a higher risk of getting it. Also, people who are smokers, have obesity, or older than 50 years of age are at greater risk. Barrett’s esophagus is more common in white and Hispanic men.","If you have GERD, your doctor likely will monitor you for Barrett’s esophagus. People who have severe GERD may need an endoscopy. This is an outpatient procedure to look at your esophagus and check for damage. For this test, you are given medicine to relax. Then the doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube in your throat. He or she may take a tissue sample to biopsy. This can detect abnormal cells, which can lead to cancer.

If the test shows normal cells, your doctor will recommend a follow-up endoscopy every 3 to 5 years. If the test shows abnormal cells, you may need an endoscopy once a year.

One of the complications of Barrett’s esophagus is esophageal strictures (when the esophagus becomes very narrow). One symptom of this is difficulty swallowing. When the doctor performs an endoscopy for that symptom, they often will find and diagnose Barrett’s esophagus.","You can help prevent Barrett’s esophagus. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, such as:

• Quitting smoking, if you smoke.
• Being more active.
• Losing weight.

Avoiding foods that trigger heartburn. Common ones are coffee, chocolate, peppermint, and alcohol. Greasy, spicy, or tomato-based foods can cause heartburn as well.","The main form of treatment is a group of medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). These help relieve pain and reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. They keep Barrett’s esophagus from getting worse. In severe cases, surgery may be done to stop reflux and keep stomach acid out of the esophagus.","There is no cure for Barrett’s esophagus. But treating the GERD symptoms may reduce further damage. Follow your doctor’s orders to get regular endoscopies, if needed. This can detect abnormal or precancerous cells.","• If I have GERD, will I eventually have Barrett’s esophagus?
• How long do I need to take medicine to treat Barrett’s esophagus?
• What are the side effects of treatment?
• Are there lifestyle changes I can make to help ease my symptoms?
• If I have Barrett’s esophagus, what is my risk of cancer?","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Barrett’s Esophagus

39,Bartholin's Gland Cyst,https://familydoctor.org/condition/bartholins-gland-cyst/,"The Bartholin’s gland is a tiny organ on each of the labia (vaginal lips), near the opening of the vagina. If the vagina were the face of a clock, these glands would be found at about 4 and 8 o’clock. Normally they’re invisible. They make a small amount of fluid that lubricates the vaginal lips. If a flap of skin grows over the opening of one of the glands, the fluid backs up. It causes a round swelling called a cyst. The cyst can grow from the size of a penny to larger than an orange. Most don’t get bigger than a golf ball.","You may notice a round bulge on one of your vaginal lips, near the opening of the vagina. It may be painless or slightly tender. It may stay the same size or may slowly grow larger. Cysts that get infected are usually very tender. They usually appear quickly. In more severe cases, walking or sexual intercourse may be painful.","While most aren’t, some Bartholin’s gland cysts can be infected. Your doctor may want to check the fluid in the cyst. Most infected cysts (called abscesses) contain the normal bacteria (germs) found on your skin. Some are caused by bacteria that are transmitted sexually.","If your Bartholin’s gland cyst is small, you may not notice it. Once it grows large or becomes infected, you will notice symptoms. Your doctor will be able to diagnose the cyst by looking at it.","There is no sure way to prevent a Bartholin’s gland cyst from forming. Good hygiene may play a role in prevention. However, sometimes the cysts appear no matter how good your personal hygiene. If you think you have one, tell your doctor right away. This way, you can get early and effective treatment.","Treatment depends on the size of the cyst, how painful it is, if it’s infected, and your age. You can often treat a small Bartholin cyst by soaking in a few inches of warm water (called a sitz bath) several times a day for 3 or 4 days. Adding Epsom salt or sitz salt can help even more. This allows the cyst to rupture and drain with little pain or discomfort.

In rare cases, the doctor can perform a minor procedure in the office. The doctor makes an incision and puts a small tube (called a catheter) into the cyst. The catheter stays in place for 4 to 6 weeks, draining the fluid. While the catheter is in, you can continue normal activity. However, ask your doctor if it’s safe to have sexual activity during this time. At the end of treatment, your doctor easily removes the catheter in his or her office.

Another procedure is when the doctor makes a small cut in the cyst to drain the fluid. He or she will place stitches at the edge of the cyst to allow a small opening to form. This procedure is called a marsupialization. You may have light discharge for a few weeks. Panty liners should be all you need to take care of this discharge.

Less common procedures involve using a laser or having surgery to remove the entire gland. Both of these are usually performed in a hospital as same-day surgery.","It’s possible for Bartholin’s gland cysts to come back after treatment. This can happen even years later. If so, your doctor can treat the cyst again. Your doctor also may remove the Bartholin’s glands if cysts recur often.","• I have a bump on one of my vaginal lips. Could it be a Bartholin’s gland cyst?
• Do I need any tests, such as tests for sexually transmitted infections?
• How serious is the Bartholin cyst? Is it infected?
• What are my treatment options? What treatment do you recommend for me?
• Is it safe for me to have sex?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Bartholin Cyst or Abscess

40,Bedbugs,https://familydoctor.org/condition/bedbugs/,"Bedbugs are oval-shaped, wingless parasites. They have 6 legs and are about 1/5 of an inch long. They range in color from white to brown, and look dark red after feeding. Bedbugs feed on blood during the night and hide during the day. They prefer human blood, but also will feed on other mammals, such as dogs or cats.

Bedbugs live in dry, dark openings, such as mattress seams. Mattresses are ideal because bedbugs feed at night. However, they live in more places than just mattresses. They can live in gaps in your furniture, walls, or floors, then crawl into your bed at night. Places such as hotels, apartments, dorms, and shelters are more likely to be infested with bedbugs. This is because more people come and go in these places. Bedbugs can travel from place to place on clothing, luggage, furniture, and used bedding.","Bedbug bites show up as small, swollen, red bumps. They may or may not have a bite mark in the center. The bites are very itchy. It is common to have several bites at a time, often in a straight row on your skin.

Other signs that you have bedbugs are:

• Small bloodstains on your sheets
• Dark flecks of bedbug feces in places where bedbugs might live
• A sweet odor that indicates the presence of a large number of bedbugs

The best time to search for live bedbugs is in the middle of the night when they come out to feed.",Bedbugs are a growing problem in the United States. One cause could be an increase in international travel. This leads to people bringing bedbugs back in their luggage or on their clothes. The change in pesticides is another possible cause. Chemicals that used to get rid of bedbugs in the past have been replaced with milder chemicals that do not harm bedbugs. This has allowed the bedbug population in the United States to grow.,"A doctor can usually diagnose bedbug bites. You should call your doctor right away if:

• Your bites become red and swollen
• Your bites form blisters or sores
• You have a fever

You may have an infection or a severe allergic reaction.","Insect repellent does not keep bedbugs away. The best way to prevent them is to avoid bringing them into your home. When you travel, be sure to inspect your bed for signs of bedbugs before you sleep in it. Check your luggage for bed bugs before and after you travel. Inspect all used furniture before you bring it home. If you buy used clothes, bring them home in plastic bags and wash them right away in hot water. Try to keep bedrooms clean and picked up. Dirt and clutter give bedbugs more places to hide.","Bedbug bites should go away within 2 weeks. You can apply an over-the-counter (OTC) hydrocortisone cream or lotion on the bites to relieve the itchiness and swelling. An OTC antihistamine pill or cream called diphenhydramine (brand name: Benadryl) can relieve itchiness as well. It’s important to avoid scratching your bites as much as possible. Scratching can damage your skin, which can cause an infection.

If an OTC treatment doesn’t help, you may need to call your doctor. They can order a prescription-strength medicine to treat your symptoms. They also will prescribe an antibiotic if you have an infection.","Bedbugs can be a terrible nuisance, but they have not been shown to spread disease.

If you have bedbugs in your home, wash all of your clothes and bedding in hot water. The water temperature must be at least 120°F to kill the bedbugs. Then, dry them in a hot dryer. If possible, avoid taking your laundry to a public laundromat or dry cleaner. This can lead to a bedbug outbreak.

Vacuum all of your luggage and furniture, including your mattress and box springs. If anything is infested, either replace it or cover it with plastic. Dark plastic works better. Then, place it in a dry spot with direct sunlight. The hotter it is the more bedbugs will die from the heat. Keep the item in sunlight for at least 24 hours. Afterward, fix any cracks in your furniture. Fill and seal any cracks or holes in the walls or floors.

If it is cold outside, you can freeze the infested items instead. Place them in a dry, shaded spot outside. Freezing will take 2 to 4 days at 0°F and about 7 days at 20°F.

If your infestation is severe, you may need to contact a pest control professional. Ask questions about what chemicals they use. Be sure to keep children and pets away during the treatment.","• How can I be sure I have bedbugs?
• How do I get rid of bedbugs to make sure they don’t come back?
• Can I transmit bedbugs to and from other places on my body or clothing?

41,Bell’s Palsy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/bells-palsy/,"Bell’s palsy is a condition that temporarily paralyzes the side of your face. It can affect all or part of the muscles in your face. In rare cases, both sides of your face may be affected. Bell’s palsy occurs when your facial nerve (or 7th cranial nerve) is damaged. The facial nerve carries signals for movement, taste, and other information to and from your face. When this nerve is damaged, the signals between your face and brain do not work as well. While it may seem scary at the time, this condition usually doesn’t last long.","The symptoms of Bell’s palsy are very similar to the symptoms of a stroke. That is why it is important to get evaluated immediately to rule that out.

If you have Bell’s palsy, you may have some of the following symptoms:

• Drooping that makes your face look uneven
• Loss of facial expression
• Twitching
• Trouble eating or drinking
• Trouble speaking
• Total or partial loss of taste
• Ear pain
• Ringing in your ear(s)
• Headache
• Sensitivity to sound
• Trouble closing your eye
• Dry eye

These symptoms usually affect one side of your face. They appear quickly and reach their worst in a couple of days.","All causes of Bell’s palsy are not known. It may occur when a virus, such as the common cold, makes your facial nerve swell. The swollen nerve presses against the bone around it. This pressure can stop the nerve from working correctly.

You may be more likely to get this condition if you are between 15 and 60 years of age or have one of the following:

• Herpes simplex
• Diabetes
• A common cold
• The flu
• High blood pressure
• Lyme disease
• Mononucleosis
• HIV or another autoimmune disorder
• Sarcoidosis
• Head trauma

Bell’s palsy affects about 1 in every 5,000 people. Once you have had this condition, you have a slightly higher chance of getting it again.","There is no specific test to diagnose Bell’s palsy. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and medical history. A stroke, injury, or tumor also can cause facial paralysis. Your doctor will check to see what condition is causing your symptoms. They may do tests, such as an X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",You can’t prevent or avoid Bell’s palsy. Contact your doctor when symptoms first begin to start treatment.,"Bell’s palsy often goes away on its own within 1 to 2 months. Your chances of full recovery are improved with a course of steroid medicine. Your doctor can prescribe this. Your doctor may also prescribe you an anti-viral medicine, too.

At home, you can take simple steps to help your recovery. Eat well and get plenty of rest so you can heal. Protect your eyes with sunglasses when you’re outdoors. Be careful to keep your eyes moist, especially when you’re working at a computer. Wearing an eye patch can help keep your eyes closed at night. Apply low heat, such as a gel pack or heating pad, to help relieve pain and swelling. Gently massage the area. Talk to your doctor if you have severe pain.","Your recovery time will depend on how badly your facial nerve is damaged. If it takes a long time to improve, you may have a few lasting effects. For example, you may have facial movements you can’t control, or your eyes may water or tear.","• Will my facial paralysis go away?
• How long will I have symptoms?
• What medicines treat Bell’s palsy? What are their side effects?
• Are there exercises I can do, or lifestyle changes I can make to improve symptoms?

43,Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV),https://familydoctor.org/condition/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/,Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a problem with the inner ear. It causes you to feel dizzy for a short period or longer. It comes on suddenly. It is the most common form of vertigo and the easiest to treat.,"You might feel like the room is spinning or that your surroundings are moving. This feeling is called vertigo. BPPV is associated with feelings of vertigo when you move a certain way. This could be when you turn your head, stand up, roll over in bed, or lie down. Even moving your eyes quickly can trigger dizziness. You might also feel nauseated. The nausea and dizziness usually go away in a few seconds. Sometimes it can last longer. BPPV is bothersome, but it’s rarely serious.","Your inner ear contains tiny calcium particles that help you keep your balance. When you move your head, the calcium particles stimulate your nerves. The nerves send your brain a signal telling it which direction your head is moving. Normally, these particles are distributed evenly in the inner ear’s 3 canals.

Sometimes, the particles get displaced. When this happens, the nerves tell your brain that your head has moved more than it has. This incorrect signal causes vertigo.

BPPV is most often associated with aging. Other causes include a family history, an ear infection, or a head injury.",Your doctor may suspect BPPV if you feel dizzy when you move your head or body in certain ways. He or she will conduct a physical exam and ask you about your symptoms. They may order tests to rule out other causes of your vertigo. These could include different types of tests to provide an image of your inner ear and head.,"The primary thing you can do to prevent or avoid BPPV is to avoid head positions that trigger it. Also, talk to your doctor about preventing ear infections.","Your doctor can show you some easy head movements that will help relieve BPPV. These movements help shift the particles out of the inner ear canals and into areas where they will not cause vertigo. Doing these movements can stop the symptoms. They may keep the dizziness from coming back.

If your BPPV is caused by an ear infection, your doctor may be able to suggest antihistamines. Other medicine to treat the dizziness includes anticholinergics, meclizine, or scopolamine.",BPPV can be bothersome and uncomfortable. But the simple head maneuvers usually help the symptoms go away. It can come back at any time but is easily treatable.,"• What could be causing my dizziness?

44,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH),https://familydoctor.org/condition/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-bph/,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the medical term for an enlarged prostate. The condition affects the prostate gland in men. The enlargement isn’t caused by cancer or infection.

The prostate makes semen. It is located between the bladder (where urine is stored) and the urethra (the tube urine passes through). As men age, the prostate gland slowly gets bigger. As it gets bigger, it may press on the urethra. This can cause a slower, weaker urine stream.","Most symptoms of BPH start gradually. They include:

• Getting up more often at night to urinate
• Having to empty the bladder often during the day
• Difficulty in starting the urine flow
• Dribbling after urination ends
• Decrease in the size and strength of the urine stream
• Incontinence, or difficulty controlling urination

These symptoms can be caused by other things besides BPH. They may be signs of more serious diseases, such as a bladder infection or bladder cancer. Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. They can decide which tests to use to find the possible cause.

Severe BPH without treatment can lead to bladder and kidney infections.","The exact cause of BPH isn’t well understood. It appears to be related to aging. About 50% of men over age 50 have BPH. Up to 90% of men older than 80 have it. The following factors could increase your risk of BPH:

• Age 40 or older
• Family history of BPH
• Obesity
• Heart and circulatory disease
• Type 2 diabetes
• Inactivity
• Erectile dysfunction

Changing male hormone levels as a man ages may also be to blame.","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. They will do a rectal exam to check your prostate. For this, your doctor will put a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. They will feel the size of your prostate gland.

Your doctor may do blood or urine tests to make sure that your prostate problem is benign. An ultrasound exam or a biopsy of the prostate may also help in the diagnosis.","There is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid BPH. Exercise, controlling your type 2 diabetes, and losing weight may reduce your risk of BPH.

If your symptoms are mild or only slightly bothersome, you can usually control them with simple changes. These include:

• Reduce liquid intake, especially before bed or going out in public.
• Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and over-the-counter medicines that make you urinate more.
• Train your bladder to hold urine longer.
• Exercise your pelvic floor muscles.
• Prevent constipation.

Your doctor can prescribe different medicines to treat BPH. Some of these improve urine flow or reduce blockages in the bladder. Others stop or shrink the growth of the prostate. Sometimes a combination of different medicines is used. Your doctor will recommend medicine based on your symptoms and condition.

Minimally invasive treatment does not involve surgery. These treatments use heat to destroy prostate tissue that is pressing on the urethra. They can usually be done in the doctor’s office. This is done by inserting a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) through the urethra to reach the prostate. These treatments may require local, regional, or general anesthesia.

These treatments relieve symptoms. They do not cure BPH. Your doctor will consider your symptoms and overall health when deciding what procedure you should have.

Surgery is the most effective treatment for BPH. It is a last resort when other treatments fail. This is also the best way to diagnose and cure early cancer of the prostate. Surgery is usually done through the urethra, leaving no scars. Surgery does have risks. These include bleeding, infection or impotence. Risks are generally small.","Treatment for BPH depends on what symptoms you have and how severe they are. Options include lifestyle changes, medicine, minimally invasive procedures, and surgery.","BPH is not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. There are also some complications that can occur. These include:

• Inability to urinate
• Incontinence
• Blood in the urine
• Urinary tract infections
• Bladder or kidney damage
• Bladder stones

Some men have urinary symptoms that are not related to BPH. They could be the signs of a more serious condition, including prostate cancer. See your doctor right away if you notice any of the following symptoms:

• Complete inability to urinate
• Painful, urgent, and frequent need to urinate
• Blood in your urine
• Pain in the lower abdomen and/or urinary tract

There are different kinds of bipolar disorder. They vary based on your symptoms and how often and sudden you have mood swings, or episodes.","Most people with mood swings don’t have bipolar disorder. However, intense mood swings are the main symptom of the disorder. At times, you may feel very happy, full of energy, and able to do anything. This can make you excited and unable to rest. This is called mania. At other times, you may feel very sad and alone. This can be painful and make you not want to do anything. This is called depression. People who have bipolar disorder alternate between mania and depression. It’s even possible to have symptoms of both at the same time. Your mood swings may be frequent and short, or spread out and last longer.

• Feeling excited or wired.
• Feeling irritated or sensitive.
• Having trouble focusing.
• Not sleeping well or at all.
• Being more active than usual.
• Spending a lot of money.
• Abusing alcohol and drugs.
• Doing risky or reckless things, including sexual acts.
• Thinking and talking so fast that other people can’t follow your thoughts.

• No interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy, including sex.
• Feeling sad or numb.
• Crying easily or for no reason.
• Feeling slowed down.
• Feeling tired all of the time.
• Feeling hopeless, worthless, or guilty.
• Losing or gaining weight.
• Having trouble focusing, remembering, or making decisions.
• Having headaches, backaches, or digestive problems.
• Having trouble sleeping or wanting to sleep all of the time.
• Having thoughts about death and suicide.",Bipolar disorder may be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Genetics may be a factor. You have a greater chance of having bipolar disorder if it runs in your family.,"Talk to your doctor if you think you have bipolar disorder. The doctor can do a physical exam and mental assessment. Usually, bipolar disorder is first diagnosed in a person when he or she is a young adult.

People who have bipolar disorder seek care when they’re depressed more often than when they’re manic. This can make it hard to diagnose the condition correctly. Be prepared to share all of your symptoms, health, and family history with your doctor. You may consider taking a family member or loved one to your appointment. A correct diagnosis gives you the best chance at getting helpful treatment.",You can’t prevent or avoid bipolar disorder.,"Some people who have bipolar disorder don’t want to get treatment. Some don’t think they need treatment. Some think they can get better on their own. Often, they don’t realize how much the disorder affects their lives and the lives of the people around them. However, don’t be embarrassed to go to the doctor for bipolar disorder. Your doctor can help you manage your symptoms and balance your emotions.

You and your doctor will work together to create a treatment plan. Medicines are an important part of that plan. Some are used to stop the mood swings. Mood stabilizers can even out the highs and lows in your mood. Antidepressant medicine can help reduce the symptoms of depression. It’s important to tell your doctor if you’re taking any over-the-counter medicines. He or she can tell you if they will affect your antidepressants. Your doctor may add other medicines, too, based on your symptoms.

Note the medicines may not work right away. It may take a few weeks before you notice a difference in your moods. Continue to take your medicines per your doctor’s orders. It’s important to be consistent in order to get the best outcome.

It’s also important to get counseling if you have bipolar disorder. This is a big part of treatment. It can help you with stress, concerns, and relationship problems.","If you have bipolar disorder, it’s likely you will always have some degree of it. Treatment can help reduce your symptoms, but other things help, too. They include:

• Research and learn about bipolar disorder. Ask your doctor for resources. Involve your family and tell them about the condition.
• Stick to a regular routine. Go to bed and wake up at about the same time each day. Eat healthy meals. Exercise at regular times.
• Get outside. Outdoor activities are essential to maintain a stable mood.
• Take your medicine every day. Don’t stop taking it, even if you start to feel better. It may take time for your medicine and therapy to have an effect on your life. Try to be patient and stay focused on your goals.
• Ask your doctor if you can drink caffeine or alcohol with your medicine.
• Learn the early warning signs of your illness. Tell your doctor when you notice changes in your mood, thoughts, or behavior.
• Join a support group. You and your family can share information and experiences with the support group. Hearing from others in similar situations can help.","• What treatment is best for bipolar disorder?

Not everyone has symptoms. Symptoms are triggered by the movement of the stones. Another trigger is when the stones block the urine from leaving the bladder.

After surgery, your doctor will check to make sure all stones are gone. They may repeat tests to confirm. Your doctor also might prescribe medicine to prevent infection.

Your doctor may need to treat the cause of your bladder stones. For example, if your doctor finds a tumor in your bladder, they will check for cancer. The current clinical recommendation from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) does not include routine preventive screening for bladder cancer. Left untreated, bladder stones can cause lasting damage. This includes repeat UTIs or injury to your bladder, kidney, or urethra.

National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Bladder stones","Bladder stones are formed by minerals in your urine. Common problems that lead to bladder stones include:

• Enlarged prostate
• Blockage at the base of the bladder
• Bladder diverticulum (the bladder lining pokes through a weak part in the bladder wall)
• A urinary tract infection
• Radiation to your pelvis
• Nerve damage
• Bladder surgery
• Cystocele (when a woman’s bladder wall weakens, drops and creates pressure in the pelvic area)
• Not emptying your bladder all the way

Acidic urine can cause bladder stones. Overly concentrated urine can cause bladder stones. A foreign object in your bladder can cause bladder stones.

Kidney stones are not the same as bladder stones. Kidney stones don’t always go away on their own. If they get stuck in the bladder, they can produce new stones.","If you have symptoms, see your doctor. Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will press on your stomach to see if you are in pain. For men, your doctor may do a rectal exam to check your prostate. Additional tests include:

• A urine test (using a sterile wipe to avoid bacteria)
• Pelvic imaging (CT scan, X-ray, ultrasound)
• Urinary tract imaging (CT scan), which might include a special dye injected into your veins to highlights the stones
• Cystoscopy (inserting a small, flexible tube attached to a camera into your urethra, where urine passes.)","Several factors can help prevent or avoid bladder stones. These include:

• Treat a UTI early.
• See your doctor about other medical conditions that cause bladder stones.
• Stay healthy. Drink plenty of water. Avoid food high in fat, salt, and sugar.
• Avoid smoking.
• Avoid illegal drugs.
• Don’t wait to see your doctor when you notice symptoms.","Some bladder stones (small ones) pass on their own. This happens as you urinate. There may be some pain as they pass. Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water each day to increase urination. In most cases, your doctor will need to remove them. The most common way is to use a cystoscope. Your doctor will insert a small tube attached to a camera into your urethra. The camera detects the stones. Your doctor uses a laser or ultrasound to break the stones into smaller sizes. Fluids will wash out the remaining pieces. If stones are too large, surgery may be necessary. Your doctor will cut an opening near your pelvis to remove the stones. Surgery requires some form of anesthesia. You might have to stay in a hospital.",null,"• How can I tell the difference between bladder stones and kidney stones?

47,Blepharospasm,https://familydoctor.org/condition/blepharospasm/,"Blepharospasm is a rare condition that causes your eyelid to blink or twitch. You can’t control it. This is called involuntary blinking or twitching. The twitching is caused by a muscle spasm around your eye.

Blepharospasm is just one of several reasons your eyes might twitch. More common reasons include minor things, such as being tired or high caffeine use. Serious reasons might include neurological diseases. Blepharospasm affects women more than men. It may run in families.","Symptoms of blepharospasm include repeated, uncontrolled eye twitching or blinking. The twitching often happens during times you are overly tired, stressed, or anxious. It can also happen when you’re exposed to bright light and sunlight. It might get better when you’re sleeping or concentrating on a task.

The uncontrollable twitching can become worse over time. Eventually, you may feel as if it’s difficult to open your eyelids. As the condition progresses, your eyelids may be closed for several hours at a time. Spasms can develop in your face, as well.","Blepharospasm is caused by abnormal brain function in the part of your brain that controls muscles. Doctors aren’t sure why this happens. Symptoms can be triggered by stress and being overly tired. Or they could be triggered by a neurological condition, including Tourette syndrome or Parkinson’s disease. Some medicines can make blepharospasm worse. Be sure to tell your doctor about any medicines you’re taking.","Your doctor will examine your eye and ask about your symptoms. He or she will ask you about your medical history. If he or she suspects your eyelid twitching is caused by anything more than stress or being tired, you may be referred to a for a neurological exam. Such an exam might include imaging tests of your brain and eyes. These could include X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scans. These scans allow doctors to look inside your body.",Blepharospasm can’t be prevented or avoided.,"There is no cure for blepharospasm. But there are treatments to ease your symptoms.

• Some injection-type medicines, such as botulinum toxin (brand name: Botox), can treat muscle conditions. These medicines temporarily weaken the muscles of the eyelids. The medicine is injected with a needle under the skin of the eyelid.
• Some oral medicines may work, but only for a short period of time. Symptoms usually return.
• A surgical procedure called a myectomy can treat symptoms. This surgery removes some of the muscles and nerves within the eyelid.

Treatments also may depend on the underlying cause of your blepharospasm. For example, medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease may ease the eye twitch.

Some people use alternative treatments. These could include biofeedback, acupuncture, hypnosis, chiropractic care, and nutritional therapy. These haven’t been proven to be effective treatments.","Blepharospasm is a lifelong disorder. Talk to your doctor about how to ease your symptoms. Also, consider keeping a journal to track when the twitching occurs. You may notice it happens during exposure to bright lights, times of stress, or when you are overly tired. Knowing your triggers can help you avoid or reduce your symptoms.","• Is blepharospasm genetic?

48,Bloating,https://familydoctor.org/condition/bloating/,"The medical term is “meteorism.” But we all know the term “bloating” and the way it makes us feel. Bloating occurs in your abdomen (stomach). It happens when your gastrointestinal (GI) tract is filled with air or gas from what you eat, your lifestyle, or for medical reasons. The GI tract runs from the mouth to the anus (bottom). It includes your entire digestive system. When you are bloated, you feel as if you’ve eaten a big meal and there is no room in your stomach. Your stomach feels full and tight. It can be uncomfortable or painful. Your stomach may look bigger. It can make your clothes fit tighter. The good news is that certain lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, can reduce that awful feeling.","Common symptoms of bloating include stomach pain, discomfort, and gas (flatulence). You may also burp or belch frequently or have abdominal rumbling or gurgling.

However, if you have any of the following symptoms, along with severe bloating, call your doctor:

• Blood in your stool
• Noticeable weight loss (without trying)
• Vaginal bleeding (between your periods, or if you are postmenopausal)
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Diarrhea
• Heartburn that is getting worse
• Fever (due to an infection)","Bloating happens when the GI tract becomes filled with air or gas. This can be caused by food sensitivities (something you ate) or a medical condition. It can even be caused by stress and hormones. Some foods produce more gas than others. It can also be caused by lactose intolerance (problems with dairy). Other simple causes include:

• Swallowing air (this can happen when you chew gum, smoke, or eat too fast)
• Constipation
• Overeating
• Reflux (GERD)
• Weight gain
• Menstruation (in some women)
• Small bowel bacterial overgrowth (bacteria in the small intestine)

Other causes could include medical conditions, such as:

• Infection
• Inflammation (such as a condition called diverticulitis)
• Irritable bowel syndrome
• Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
• Liver disease (abnormal buildup of fluid in your stomach or pelvis)
• Crohn’s disease
• Blockage in your bowel or bladder
• Hormones
• Cancer (ovarian, uterine, colon, pancreatic, or stomach)
• Mental health factors, such as stress, anxiety, or depression
• Some medicines containing acarbose, lactulose, or sorbitol
• Some medical procedures, such as a hernia repair, because doctors pump gas into your abdominal area to see while they are completing the procedure

If your bloating is caused by something more serious, such as a medical condition, your doctor will treat the underlying cause.","Your doctor can generally diagnose the cause of your bloating through a physical exam in the office. They will ask you questions about your symptoms. They will want to know if your bloating is occasional or if it occurs all the time.

Temporary bloating is usually not serious. If it happens all the time, your doctor may order other tests. These could include an imaging test to look inside your abdomen. This could be an X-ray or CT scan.","There are many ways to prevent and avoid bloating:

• Anything that gets you moving helps, including a brisk walk, yoga, and dancing.
• Adding more fiber to your diet can help. This can be through whole wheat cereals and bread for example as well as leafy greens and apples. Although some vegetables, such as cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, turnips, beans, and lentils can cause bloating, other vegetables such as peppers, carrots, lettuce, radishes, and others are helpful when consumed on a regular basis. More fiber also helps reduce constipation. If foods alone don’t help, consider taking a fiber supplement.
• Avoid chewing gum.
• Avoid using straws for drinking.
• Avoid talking a lot while eating.
• Reduce or avoid drinking carbonated drinks (such as soda).
• Reduce or avoid eating and drinking foods that include fructose or sorbitol. These artificial sweeteners are often found in sugar-free foods.
• Eat slowly.
• Avoid dairy products if you notice they cause gas and bloating.
• Quit smoking.
• Eat smaller meals more frequently.","For temporary bloating, ask your doctor about over-the-counter medicines that relieve gas and bloating. These could include simethicone or charcoal caps. Probiotics (such as some types of yogurts), and certain herbal ingredients can relieve your discomfort, too. Herbal ingredients include peppermint and chamomile tea, anise, caraway, coriander, fennel, and turmeric.

Place a hot water bottle or compress on your stomach, or even take a hot shower to help relieve bloating.

Exercise can do wonders. Walk, do yoga, dance, or work on abdominal core strengthening exercises to alleviate bloating. Even laying down and bringing your knees to your chest and holding them there for 3 to 5 minutes can help.","Living with bloating can be uncomfortable. You may have stomach pain or just a sense of fullness. When it affects how your clothes fit, it can be frustrating. If your bloating is constant, don’t suffer unnecessarily. See your doctor to determine if the cause of the bloating is something more serious.","• Do I need a test to diagnose lactose intolerance?

49,Blood Clots,https://familydoctor.org/condition/blood-clots/,"Blood clots are differently sized clumps of blood that have formed inside your body. Clotting is important to prevent excessive bleeding if you are injured or cut. However, when a blood clot blocks blood flow to important areas of your body, it can be harmful, even deadly. Blood clots can occur in your arms and legs, abdomen (stomach), heart, lungs, brain, and kidneys.

There are two different types of blood clots. These include clots that stay in place and don’t move (thrombosis) and those that break away from the spot where they developed and move to different areas inside your body (embolism). Depending on what the clot blocks or where it moves, a blood clot can be deadly.","Symptoms are different depending on where the blood clot is located.

• Arms or legs: You may experience pain (that feels like an intense cramp), swelling, and tenderness. Your skin may be red and warm to the touch where the clot is located.
• Abdomen: You may experience severe stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.
• Heart: You may experience a heavy feeling or pain in your chest, pain in your upper body, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, and light-headedness.
• Lungs: You could experience sharp chest pain, a racing heart, shortness of breath, sweating, and fever. You may cough up blood.
• Brain: You may have weakness in your face, arms, or legs, speech and vision difficulties, headache, and dizziness.

Many of these symptoms are the symptoms associated with other conditions, such as heart attacks and stroke. If you suspect you have a blood clot, see a doctor immediately.","Your body reacts to an injury or cut by clotting your blood just the way it should. These types of clots are not a problem. Sometimes a blood clot will form without a trigger (such as an injury or cut). This is more likely to happen with certain risk factors or conditions. Risk factors include:

• Prolonged sitting (often the case with travel when you are forced to sit for long periods in an airplane, a train, or a car)
• Prolonged bed rest (often the case with surgery or illness)
• Pregnancy
• Smoking
• Obesity
• Birth control pills/hormone replacement therapy/breast cancermedicines
• Certain cancer types (pancreatic, lung, multiple myeloma, or blood-related cancers)
• Trauma (serious injury)
• Some types of major surgery
• Age (especially over the age of 60)
• A family history of blood clots
• Autoimmune disorders
• Diseases related to chronic inflammation
• Certain infections (HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, or Lyme disease)","Whether you go to your doctor’s office or an emergency room, the doctor will examine your symptoms. The doctor also will ask you about your medical history, your family’s medical history, and the medicines you are taking. They may order a blood test to send to the lab.

A blood test also can diagnose an autoimmune disorder or certain infections. The test involves inserting a small needle into a vein in your arm to draw a sample of blood. There are several lab tests that can check for abnormal clotting and for the presence of antibodies that interfere with clotting.","Blood clots are highly preventable. To prevent or avoid a blood clot, know your personal risk factors and control the risks you can. For example, if you smoke, stop. If you have obesity, try to lose weight. Increase your activity level if you are inactive. If you take birth control pills, talk to your doctor about an effective alternative. Finally, if you have a family history of blood clots, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may determine whether you should be taking blood-thinning medicine to prevent clots.","A blood clot is treated based on where it is located. Oral blood thinner medicines are the most common treatments for blood clots. Some medicines can be given through a catheter (a long, thin tube) inserted into the area of the clot. Some clots can be surgically removed. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant. Medicines may involve risks to your unborn child. If your blood clot is due to an infection, your doctor may be able to treat the infection and reduce the risk of a clot.","A blood clot can usually be treated successfully if detected early. If it was not treated early, your quality of life depends on the seriousness of the damage. For example, a blood clot can cause stroke, even death. If you’ve successfully survived a blood clot, you may live with the fear of having another. Take care not to cut yourself (even when shaving) if you take blood thinner medicines. The medicine can make it difficult to stop the bleeding.","• How can I tell the difference between symptoms of a blood clot and another condition?
• How much time does it usually take for a blood clot to travel to a danger zone once it breaks apart?
• If I have one of the risk factor diseases or conditions, should I be taking a blood thinner?
• How do I know if I need to see a doctor if I cut myself while taking blood thinner medicine?
• Can I pass a blood clot through urine or stool?","American Society of Hematology: Blood Clots

50,Blood Poisoning (Sepsis),https://familydoctor.org/condition/blood-poisoning/,"Blood poisoning (sepsis) has nothing to do with poison. Instead, it’s primary cause is the presence of germs, which enter your bloodstream from an infection elsewhere in your body. This can happen through wounds, burns, cuts, and scrapes. Bacteria can come from something as simple as a sinus infection. Although blood poisoning is often a result of a bacterial infection, even a COVID-19 viral infection can lead to sepsis as well as influenza and fungal infections. Any of these situations can lead to blood poisoning.

Untreated infection in the bloodstream can trigger sepsis. Sepsis is the body’s life-threatening response to a bacterial infection and is often a medical emergency. Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. Bacterial infections that lead to sepsis most often start in the lung, urinary tract, skin, or gastrointestinal tract. Without timely treatment, sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.

Both blood poisoning requires immediate treatment. This is to prevent sepsis from infecting major organs, like the lungs, kidneys, and heart. Sepsis is unpredictable, aggressive, and progresses rapidly.

Anyone can get blood poisoning, but the risk is higher for:

• Infants and young children (especially under 1 year of age)
• Older people (65 years of age or older)
• People who have a weakened immune system
• People who have chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, cancer, and AIDS
• People who have just had surgery","The symptoms of blood poisoning are similar to symptoms of a cold or the flu and may include:

• Chills, shivering
• Sudden fever (moderate to high temperature)
• Fast heartbeat
• Rapid breathing
• Heart palpitations (heart skips a beat or seems to flutter)
• Low energy (more in children)
• Irritability (more in children)

Additional symptoms that indicate sepsis, include:

• Confusion or disorientation
• Extreme pain or discomfort
• Shortness of breath
• Clammy or sweaty skin

If you recently had surgery or a wound that could be infected, take these symptoms seriously. They could signal blood poisoning. If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away.","Blood poisoning is most often caused by a bacterial infection entering your bloodstream. However, it also can be cause by some viral infections, such as COVID-19, influenza, and fungal infections. Bacteria can enter your bloodstream in multiple ways, including daily activities, such as brushing your teeth too vigorously. A simple dental cleaning can cause bacteria to enter your bloodstream. This is true if you have certain risk factors. Risk factors include prior knee or hip replacement. It’s difficult for your body to clear bacteria around prosthetic devices. In dental visits, your dentist will have you take antibiotics before your appointment to prevent infection. Bacteria can enter your bloodstream through a scraped knee or other wound. Urinary tract infections are a common source of blood poisoning. Even a sinus infection can cause bacteria to enter your bloodstream.

Your immune system will eliminate small amounts of germs. When this doesn’t happen, it can cause blood poisoning. Too many germs can enter your bloodstream at once. Your immune system can’t keep up. This causes blood poisoning.","Blood poisoning is diagnosed by examining a blood sample to find bacteria in the blood. Also, doctors check the number of white blood cells in the sample. If you suspect you have blood poisoning, call your doctor right away. Your doctor will examine you and order blood tests, if necessary.

If bacteria are in your blood, your doctor will identify the type of bacteria. If you have a cut or other wound on your body, your doctor may swab that area to collect bacteria.","To lower your risk of blood poisoning:

• Take care of cuts and open wounds. Don’t let them become infected. Keep them clean. Treat them with antiseptic medicine or as directed by your doctor.
• Get flu and pneumonia vaccines.
• Don’t ignore a toothache. A tooth infection can cause blood poisoning. See your dentist before it becomes a bigger problem.
• See your doctor for sinus and ear infections.
• Be aware that infection can occur following surgery or a medical treatment.","The treatment of blood poisoning often involves admission to a hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) for those who are very sick. This is so that your doctor can give you antibiotics and other medicines intravenously and closely monitor your organ systems. Fast treatment is important. Blood poisoning can become a more serious case of sepsis. Sepsis is life-threatening. It damages vital organs. When blood poisoning is caught early and doesn’t do any serious damage, you can then be switched to oral antibiotics that you can take at home. These are usually in pill form.","Many people fully recover from blood poisoning. However, untreated blood poisoning or catching it too late can worsen is serious sepsis. When you have sepsis, damage to major organs may be irreversible. For example, kidney damage could lead to lifelong dialysis. Once you have had blood poisoning, you’re at higher risk for developing infections in the future.","• Am I in a high-risk group for blood poisoning?
• Do all prosthetic devices increase your risk of infection?
• Why are flu and pneumonia vaccines important in preventing blood poisoning?

51,Bone Cancer | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/bone-cancer/,"Bone cancer is a rare but serious condition that starts in the cells of your bones. Knowing the common bone cancer symptoms and treatment options can help you recognize warning signs early and get the right care. With early diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan, many people can manage the condition and improve their quality of life.

Bone cancer is cancer of the bones. It can begin as a tumor in a bone or it can spread to the bone from another area. Most cases of bone cancer start in other areas. When the cancer spreads to the bones, it is called metastatic cancer, or secondary cancer. It is rare for cancer to start in a person’s bones.

Bone cancer consists of cancerous (malignant) tumors. These destroy bone tissue and can continue to spread. Noncancerous (benign) tumors are often not life threatening but can still cause damage to your bones.

There are three main forms of bone cancer.

• Osteosarcoma occurs in the hard (osteoid) bone tissue. Most often, it is found in your thighbone just above your knee or in your upper arm. It typically affects children and teens under the age of 19 or people over the age of 65.
• Chondrosarcoma occurs in cartilage. Cartilage is the tissue that connects and pads your bones and joints. Most often, this type is found in your shoulder, upper leg, or hips. It typically affects adults over the age of 40.
• Ewing sarcoma occurs in bone or surrounding soft tissue. Most often, it is found in your arms, legs, pelvis, or backbone. It typically affects children and teens, especially boys, under the age of 19.

Chordoma is another kind of bone cancer that is very rare and forms in the spine. This cancer is more common in men than women, and typically occurs in older adults.","The main symptom of bone cancer is pain. However, not everyone has pain. You also may have swelling in the area where bone cancer exists, fractures, or high levels of calcium in the blood. Other symptoms include:

• A soft, warm lump in the arms, legs, chest, or pelvis
• Unexplained fever
• Bones that break for no known reason","There are several causes of bone cancer. Many times, cancer from another part of your body spreads to your bones. This is more likely to occur in people who have had radiation or chemotherapy. Children are more vulnerable to this.

Other less common causes include:

• Family history of bone cancer
• Bone defects
• Metal implants (this is extremely rare)

In some cases, the cause of bone cancer is unknown.","There are several tests your doctor may do to look for and diagnose bone cancer. If the doctor finds a tumor, they will need to find out if it is cancerous or not","These tests may include: • X-rays • Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) • Computed tomography (CT) scan • Bone scan • Biopsy • Blood tests Can bone cancer be prevented or avoided. In general, bone cancer cannot be prevented or avoided.","Treatment options vary based on the type of bone cancer, the size, and the location. They also depend on your age and overall health. Surgery is the most common form of treatment. The goal is to remove the entire tumor. In some cases, this may require amputation of your arm or leg.

In place of surgery, the doctor may recommend cryosurgery. This treatment uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the tumor and cancer cells. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are other forms of treatment. Chemotherapy uses medicine to stop the growth of cancer cells. It can be given by mouth, injection (shot), infusion (through an IV) or even on the skin. Radiation uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.

Some types of treatment will require physical therapy or rehabilitation. Your doctor also may recommend certain lifestyle changes.","After treatment, it is important for you to have routine visits with your doctor. This can help to identify problems right away. Once bone cancer is removed, it can still come back or spread. You also may develop other types of cancer or health problems. Tell your doctor about any new symptoms you have.","• What type of bone cancer do I have?
• Is it life-threatening or dangerous?

52,Breast Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/breast-cancer/,"Breast cancer is a cancer that begins in breast tissue. It usually shows up as a tumor. There are three types of breast tumors.

• Benign (not cancerous). Most of the tumors that develop in breast tissue are benign.
• In situ. These tumors are cancerous. The cancer is confined to the breast duct or lobule. This type of breast cancer can almost always be cured with treatment.
• Invasive. This is the most serious type of breast cancer. It is when the cancerous tumors have spread to other parts of the body.

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women (after skin cancer). The good news is that the rate of death from breast cancer has declined over the last few years. This is probably because more tumors have been found early. This is when treatment can help the most. Regular mammograms can help find breast cancers early.","Symptoms of breast cancer can include:

• A lump in the breast
• Change in size or shape of the breast
• Dimpling or puckering of the skin of the breast
• Nipple turned inward toward the breast
• Scaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or areola (dark area of skin around the nipple
• Discharge from the nipple","It is not known exactly what causes breast cancer. There are certain risk factors that seem to increase your chance of getting the disease. It’s estimated that about 10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary (run in the family). In many of these cases, you inherited a gene from your parents that has mutated (changed from its normal form). This mutated gene makes it more likely for a person to get breast cancer.

Everyone has two genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. Normally, these genes help prevent cancer tumors from growing. But sometimes a person inherits a mutated form of BRCA1 or BRCA2 from his or her family. This person’s chance of getting breast cancer increases. Mutations in these genes have also been linked to ovarian cancer.

There are other mutated genes that may make it more likely for a person to get breast cancer. Scientists know about some of these genes. They are working to identify others.

Breast cancer in 2 or more first-degree relatives is a sign that the mutated form of BRCA1 or BRCA2 might run in your family. First-degree relatives include your parents, siblings, and children. Another sign is a first-degree relative who got breast cancer before the age of 50.","Your doctor can help you decide if a gene test might be useful to you. He or she can also discuss the pros and cons of taking the test. Talking with a genetic counselor might also be helpful.

Think about how you would feel if the test results showed that you are at greater risk of getting breast cancer. Some people want to know if they have one of the mutated genes. Knowing instead of wondering helps them deal with the risk of breast cancer. It allows them and their doctors to watch more closely for early signs of cancer. But other people would rather not know they have the abnormal gene. They feel that it would be too hard to cope with. Talk with your doctor about your feelings.

If you notice a lump or other change in your breast, see your doctor right away. He or she will do a physical exam. They will ask you about your health history and your family’s history of breast cancer. They will carefully feel your breasts and under your arms for lumps.

If they find something abnormal, your doctor may order a mammogram. A mammogram is a special X-ray of your breasts. Your breast will be pressed between two plates. This spreads out your breast so that a better X-ray picture can be taken. The entire process usually takes about 20 minutes.

If the mammogram shows something, your doctor may order more tests. These include:

• Ultrasound – high-energy sound waves bounce off organs and tissues to create a picture
• MRI– uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make detailed pictures
• Bloodwork – blood samples are checked for signs of disease
• Biopsy – cells or tissues are removed from the breast and looked at under a microscope. This helps find cancer cells

There are different kinds of biopsies that look for breast cancer. These include:

• Excisional – an entire lump of tissue is removed
• Incisional – part of a lump or a sample of tissue is removed
• Core – a wide needle removes tissue
• Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) – a thin needle removes tissue or fluid

If cancer cells are found in a biopsy, your doctor will do more testing. This will help him or her find out how quickly the cancer may grow, how likely it will spread, and how certain treatments might work.","There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting breast cancer. Lifestyle changes have been shown to decrease risk, even in high-risk women. These changes include:

• Not smoking
• Limiting alcohol
• Eating a healthy diet
• Keeping a healthy weight
• Exercising regularly
• Breastfeeding your babies if you can
• Limiting hormone therapy
• Minimizing exposure to radiation in screening tests if not medically necessary

You can’t always avoid breast cancer, but you can find it early. This increases your chances of a full, speedy recovery. There is no evidence that breast self-exams can help prevent breast cancer. The best way to find it early is with regular mammograms.

A mammogram is the most effective way to find breast cancer early. It can detect an abnormal area up to 2 years before it becomes large enough to feel. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends all women 50 years of age and older get a mammogram every 2 years. If you have risk factors for breast cancer, your doctor may want you to have mammograms more often. He or she also may want you to start having them at a younger age.

Mammograms can be uncomfortable, but they don’t take very long. New technology is being developed that may improve the experience. You may find that scheduling your mammogram shortly after your period makes it less uncomfortable. Your breasts may be less tender at this time.

Doing these things gives you the best chance to find cancer as early as you can. Finding breast cancer early makes treatment much easier and more effective.","There are many treatment options for breast cancer. Your doctor may recommend more than one type of treatment. What is best for one person may not be the best treatment for you. Your doctor will make the decision based on several things, including:

• Your general health
• The stage of the cancer
• Whether the tumor has hormone receptors
• The size of the tumor
• If you have gone through menopause

• Lumpectomy – The tumor and a small amount of tissue around it is removed during surgery. Surgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer.
• Mastectomy – If the cancer is widespread in the breast, all breast tissue is removed. This is called a mastectomy. If the cancer has spread to the underarm lymph nodes, the whole breast and most or all lymph nodes are removed. This is called a modified radical mastectomy.
• Radiation therapy – High-energy rays are used to kill cancer cells. It may be used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that are still there.
• Hormone therapy – Lab tests could show that your breast cancer cells have hormone receptors. If they do, hormone therapy can prevent the cancer cells from using the natural hormones they need to grow.
• Chemotherapy – Powerful drugs are used to kill cancer cells. They are given through an IV (directly into the vein) or in pill form. Chemotherapy can cause unpleasant side effects. These include weakness, tiredness, and hair loss.
• Targeted therapy – Lab tests could show that your breast cancer cells have too much of a protein called HER2. If they do, you can receive targeted therapies. These block the action of the extra HER2 protein and stop growth. They can be given in an IV or as a pill.","Many cases of breast cancer can be cured with treatment. How well you do after treatment depends on many things. This includes how early the cancer was diagnosed. Left untreated, breast cancer can spread to other parts of the body, including internal organs. This could cause serious health problems or be fatal. It is very important to get treatment as soon as possible.

Living with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Treatments can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying mildly active.

Many women choose to do nothing and to be proud of their bodies after a mastectomy. Some women may choose to have a breast reconstruction. This is surgery that rebuilds the shape of the breast. If you don’t want more surgery, you have other options. Some women wear a breast form, a device that replaces the breast. They also may wear padding inside their bras.

Even after your cancer is gone, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.","• Am I at risk for breast cancer?

This is true even if someone in your family has had the disease. Many people have had breast cancer without carrying a mutated form of BRCA1 or BRCA2. Anyone with first-degree relatives who have had breast cancer is at increased risk. But most people don’t get the inherited kind of breast cancer.

Talk with your doctor about your family history. He or she will want to know your relation to any family members who have had breast cancer. Your doctor will also want to know how old your relatives were when their breast cancer was diagnosed."
53,Breast Pain in Women,https://familydoctor.org/condition/breast-pain-in-women/,Breast pain is any level of discomfort or pain in one or both breasts. It’s more common in younger women.,"Breast pain can be a dull, continuous, ache or a sharp, shooting pain. The pain may come and go each month. Or it may last for several weeks or months.","Many things can cause pain or tenderness in your breasts, including:

• Hormone changes during your period. This is the most common cause of breast pain.
• Water retention, which may happen during your period
• Injury to your breast
• Pregnancy, especially during the first trimester
• Breastfeeding (nursing)
• An infection in the breast
• Some medicines, including hormone therapies
• Breast cancer (this rarely causes pain, but it can happen)
• Surgery from a biopsy, breast reduction, or a mastectomy
• An unsupportive bra

If you have breast pain that lasts a long time or keeps coming back, talk to your doctor.","Your doctor will examine you, ask you to describe your pain, and the location of the pain. He or she may ask you about your health history. During the exam, your doctor will check to see if you have lumps in your breasts.

If you’re younger than 30 and don’t have a breast lump, your doctor might decide you don’t need any tests. If you’re older than 30 and don’t have a breast lump, your doctor may still want you to get additional tests, especially if you are experiencing pain. Your doctor may also want tests if you do have a lump (or several lumps) in your breast. These tests can include:

• A mammogram. This is a special X-ray of the breasts.
• A breast ultrasound. This painless test uses sound waves to make a picture of the lump.
• A breast biopsy. For this test, some tissue is surgically removed from your breast and looked at under a microscope. The area that is removed is numbed to eliminate pain. It’s an outpatient procedure.","While there’s no scientific evidence lifestyle changes are effective, some women feel better when changing bra styles and cutting back on salt and caffeine.","There are different treatments for breast pain, depending on what is causing it. You and your doctor can talk about these treatments. Choose one or more that might work for you. Possible treatments for breast pain include:

• Wearing a bra that offers good support
• Applying ice or heat to the painful breast
• Taking an over-the-counter pain medicine
• Taking prescription pain medicine as directed by your doctor","Most of the time, breast pain goes away on its own after a few months.

54,Bronchiolitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/bronchiolitis/,"Bronchiolitis is a common lung infection in infants and young children. It happens when the smallest air passages in the lungs (bronchioles) become inflamed and clogged with mucus. This makes it harder for the child to breathe.

Bronchiolitis is usually caused by a virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause. Young children under age 2, particularly those between 3 months and 6 months old, get this illness most often. It peaks in winter and early spring.

Babies born prematurely are at a much higher risk of complications from RSV. There is a vaccine for RSV that is recommended for babies in this group.","The first signs of bronchiolitis look like the symptoms of a common cold. Your child may have a runny nose, cough, and a slight fever for a few days. After that, your child may begin to breathe fast and wheeze (make a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing).

• Your child is vomiting and can’t keep liquids down.
• Your child is breathing very fast, more than 40 breaths in 1 minute.
• You can see your child’s skin pull in between the ribs with each breath, or your child has to sit up to be able to breathe.
• Your child has had heart disease or was born prematurely. In this case, call the doctor at the first signs of this illness.

If your child’s lips or fingertips look bluish, he or she may not be getting enough oxygen. Seek medical care or go to the emergency room right away.",Bronchiolitis is caused by a virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause. The virus is spread when someone infected with the illness comes into direct contact with your child. This often happens when a sick person sneezes or coughs near your child. It can also happen when your child touches toys or other objects that a sick person had touched.,Your doctor will ask you about your child’s symptoms. He or she will examine your child and listen to their lungs. The doctor will check to see if your child is getting enough oxygen. They can get a sample of mucus or discharge from the nose and test it for RSV. They may also order a chest X-ray to check for pneumonia.,"RSV and other viruses that lead to bronchiolitis are common and spread easily. Older children and adults get the viruses, too. But they usually don’t get as sick as younger children. The best way to prevent bronchiolitis is to keep your child from catching a virus.

• Keep your child away from other children or people with colds or other illnesses.
• Stay away from crowded areas where viruses can spread easily. This could include elevators or shopping malls.
• Wash your hands and your child’s hands frequently.
• Regularly disinfect surfaces, toys, and objects in your home.

If your child has bronchiolitis, keep them home until the cough is almost gone. Make sure to wash your hands after you take care of your sick child.","Bronchiolitis is caused by a virus. That means antibiotics and other medicines won’t help cure it. It usually takes 2-3 weeks for the illness to run its course. In the meantime, symptoms can usually be treated at home.

If your child is very sick, your doctor may suggest putting him or her in the hospital. This could happen if he or she is working hard to breathe, isn’t getting enough oxygen, or is dehydrated. Your child can get extra oxygen and fluids in the hospital. Doctors can do deep suction on his or her airways to clear mucus from their lungs. Most children who are hospitalized for bronchiolitis go home in a few days.","In most cases, you can treat your child’s symptoms at home.

• Give your child plenty of liquids. Don’t worry if he or she doesn’t feel like eating solid foods.
• Use saline drops and an aspirator to remove mucus from the nose.
• Use a cool-mist vaporizer in the bedroom while your child is sleeping.
• Sit in a steamy bathroom with your child. Run hot water in the shower or bathtub and close the door.
• Ask your doctor if you can give your child acetaminophen (such as Infants’ Tylenol) if he or she has a fever. Don’t give your child aspirin. Aspirin has been associated with Reye’s syndrome, a rare disease of the brain and liver.","• How can I make my child more comfortable?
• How long will my child be contagious?
• Should I isolate my child from my other children as long as he/she is sick?
• How long should I keep my child home from daycare?
• If my child’s symptoms get worse, when should I call my doctor?

55,Burners,https://familydoctor.org/condition/burners/,"A “burner” is a minor injury to the nerves between your neck and shoulder. It’s also called a “stinger.” The condition gets its name from the shock-like, burning or stinging jolt of pain that shoots down your arm. It’s generally not a serious neck injury. Burners are common among people who play contact sports. These include football, rugby, and wrestling.","A burner usually happens after a hit or fall. You will probably feel:

• A burning, stinging, or electric shock sensation between your neck and shoulder.
• Burning or stinging down your arm to your hand.
• Numbness, weakness, or tingling feeling (like pins and needles) in your shoulder and arm.
• A warm sensation in your shoulder area.

You will normally feel a burner in only one arm. The pain usually goes away after a few minutes. If you have pain or numbness in both arms, or if the pain does not go away, call your doctor. These could be signs of a more serious problem.","Burners are caused by damage to the brachial plexus. This is the bundle of nerves that supplies feeling to your arm. Burners often happen when the force of a hit or fall pushes the head to one side. This can stretch, pinch, or bruise the nerves.

If you play a contact sport, you can get a burner when you tackle, block, or run into another player. There are 3 ways a burner injury can happen:

• Your shoulder is pushed down at the same time that your head is forced to the opposite side. This stretches nerves between your neck and shoulder.
• Your head is quickly moved to one side, pinching nerves on that side.
• The area above your collarbone is hit directly, and presses on nerves.","Your doctor will ask how your injury happened. He or she will examine your neck, shoulder, and arm. They will test your range of motion and check your reflexes. If your doctor thinks you could have a more serious injury, he or she will order other tests. These could include an X-ray or an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).","It can be hard to avoid burners, especially if you play contact sports. But there are steps you can take to lower the risk that you’ll experience one.

• Stretch your neck muscles before any physical activity. Tilt your head up, down, left, and right. Turn your head left and right to look over your shoulders. Hold each stretch for 20 seconds.
• Strengthen the muscles in your neck and shoulders.
• Use proper techniques. These are designed to prevent injuries.
• Wear protective gear, if possible. Some sports could allow extra neck protection.","Burners usually get better on their own. Most burners only last a few minutes. Others take several days or weeks to heal. If yours continues to hurt, you can apply ice and take anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (one brand: Advil) or naproxen (one brand: Aleve). If your burner lasts more than a few weeks, see your doctor. You may need physical therapy to stretch and strengthen your muscles. Your doctor also may recommend an arm sling or shoulder brace for comfort. This will depend on the extent of your injury.","If you have pain, numbness, or tingling, don’t continue the activity that caused the burner. Refrain from playing if you can’t move your neck in all directions or if your strength is not back to normal. You need to let the nerves completely heal. If you don’t, you increase the chances of injuring yourself again. You must be able to play your sport without any lingering problems from the injury.","• How can I tell the difference between a burner and the shooting pain of a heart attack?
• Do burners cause any permanent damage?
• How can I let coaches and school officials know about the risks of burners and what to do about them if someone gets one?
• How long will it take me to recover?
• When can I safely return to my sport?

56,Burning Mouth Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/burning-mouth-syndrome/,"Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a condition that causes pain and discomfort in your mouth, lips, or tongue. The feeling is often described as a burning, scalding, or tingling sensation. BMS is more common in women than men. It is found more in women during or after menopause. The cause of BMS can be hard to pin down. Some people may have symptoms for months or years and never know why.","Some people with BMS report symptoms appearing suddenly. For others, they may develop gradually over time. Typical symptoms of BMS include:

• Burning feeling in the mouth, tongue, or lips
• Dry mouth
• Bitter or metallic taste
• Loss of taste

BMS may occur every day, or it may come and go. Some people wake up with pain and it lasts all day. Others wake up with little pain but it gets worse as the day progresses. Regardless of the pattern, the symptoms may last for months to years.","The exact cause for BMS is unknown. Cases have been linked to:

• Nerve damage
• A dental procedure
• Nutritional deficiency (such as iron, zinc, or some B vitamins)
• Menopause or other hormonal changes
• Certain medicines (such as ACE inhibitors) used to treat high blood pressure
• Extreme allergic reactions
• Health conditions that alter taste or saliva production
• Oral yeast infection (thrush)
• Mental disorders (such as anxiety or depression)

Many times, more than one cause is present. Sometimes doctors can’t find the cause.

You are at higher risk of developing BMS if you are:

• A woman
• Post-menopausal
• Over age 50","There is no simple way to test for BMS. Your doctor will examine your mouth and ask about your medical history and symptoms. This will help better pinpoint a possible cause. They may perform tests to rule out other possible issues. This could include an oral swab to check for thrush. It may also include blood tests to check for conditions such as diabetes, thyroid issues, or mineral deficiencies.","Since there isn’t a known cause for BMS, you cannot prevent or avoid it.","There is no specific cure for burning mouth syndrome. The best thing you can do is address your symptoms. Treatment is based on your symptoms, their severity, and the underlying cause. Possible treatment options include:

• Products to produce saliva and relieve dry mouth
• Vitamin supplements (such as iron, zinc, or vitamin B) to provide nutrition
• Ointments (such as Capsaicin) to relieve pain
• Depression or anxiety medicines to relieve pain and improve your nervous system

If your doctor thinks a certain medicine is causing BMS, they might suggest switching to a new one.

If your doctor can’t find a cause, they may recommend trying oral thrush medicines, B vitamin supplements, or antidepressants. These have been found to be effective in treating BMS.","Most cases of BMS improve on their own. Additional tips for easing your symptoms include:

• Sucking on ice chips
• Drinking plenty of liquids
• Avoiding hot and spicy foods
• Avoiding foods and drinks that are high in acid, like citrus fruit, soda, and coffee
• Avoiding alcohol and tobacco products
• Avoiding products that contain alcohol
• Trying a new brand of toothpaste","• If I have dry mouth, am I at higher risk of getting burning mouth syndrome?
• What can I do to get rid of the taste and burning feeling in my mouth?
• What can I do if I’m having trouble sleeping because of the pain?
• Is something I’m eating causing my mouth to burn? If so, what changes can I make to my diet?
• Will burning mouth syndrome go away on its own?","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, Burning Mouth Syndrome

57,Bursitis of the Hip,https://familydoctor.org/condition/bursitis-of-the-hip/,"Bursitis is the painful swelling of bursae. Bursae are fluid-filled sacs that cushion your tendons, ligaments, and muscles. When they work normally, bursae help the tendons, ligaments, and muscles glide smoothly over bone. But when the bursae are swollen, the area around them becomes very tender and painful. Trochanteric bursitis is swelling affecting the bursae of the hip.

Bursitis does not only happen in the hip. It can also occur in the shoulder, knee, and elbow joints. Bursitis may be acute (short-lived) or chronic (long-lasting).","Symptoms include joint pain and tenderness. You may also see swelling and feel warmth around the affected area. The pain is often sharp in the first few days. It may be dull and achy later. You may notice it more when getting out of a chair or bed. You may also notice it when sitting for a long time and when sleeping on the affected side.

Acute bursitis usually flares over hours or days. Chronic bursitis can last from a few days to several weeks. Chronic bursitis can go away and come back again. Acute bursitis can become chronic if it comes back or if a hip injury occurs.

Over time, the bursae may become thick, which can make swelling worse. This can lead to limited movement and weakened muscles (called atrophy) in the area.","Several things can lead to hip bursitis, including the following:

• Repeated overuse or stress of the hip
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Pseudogout
• Injury of the hip
• Infection with bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (or a staph infection)
• Diabetes
• Spine problems, such as scoliosis
• Uneven leg lengths
• Bone spurs (bony growths on top of normal bone) on the hip",Your doctor will examine you and ask about your symptoms. Sometimes certain tests may be needed to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. These tests may include X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).,"You can avoid getting bursitis by not putting too much strain on your hips. Avoid activities that are especially difficult or painful. And take breaks to rest your hips. When you exercise, remember to warm up your muscles and then stretch to prevent injury. If you’re overweight, losing weight can help reduce pressure on your joints, including the hips.

Building strength in your hips with an approved workout routine can greatly reduce your chances of getting bursitis. Ask your doctor what types of exercise are best for you.","Treatment for bursitis usually involves doing strengthening exercises and stretching. This helps prevent muscle atrophy—and can also be used to prevent bursitis, not just treat it. You should avoid activities that cause pain. Ask your doctor about exercises to help build strength in the area. Your bursitis may affect your ability to function normally. If so, you may need physical therapy to help you move again. This is especially true if you have chronic bursitis.

You can also use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (brand name: Aleve) to relieve pain and swelling. You also may want to use an ice pack on the area to reduce swelling.

If these treatments don’t help, you may need to have fluid taken out of the bursa. Or you may need steroid shots to reduce pain and swelling. Steroid shots are usually very effective in treating bursitis. You may need another shot after a few months.

Surgery is rarely needed to treat bursitis. It’s used only when all other treatments fail. For people who do need surgery, it’s a simple procedure. The doctor removes the bursa from the hip. The hip can function normally without the bursa. Usually, the surgery doesn’t require a long hospital stay. The recovery period is typically short.","If you have chronic bursitis, try to minimize flare-ups by stretching each day to increase range of motion. And avoid activities that you know will result in pain. Repetitive-motion activities are especially bad for bursitis. If you do have a flare up, remember that resting your hip is important. Without proper rest, healing is delayed.","• What could have caused my symptoms?

58,C. diff (Clostridium difficile) Infection,https://familydoctor.org/condition/clostridium-difficile-c-diff-infection/,"Clostridium difficile (C. diff.) is a type of bacteria that lives in many people’s intestines. C. diff. is part of the normal balance of bacteria in your body. It also lives in the environment, such as in soil, water, and animal feces.

Most people never have problems with C. diff. However, if there is an imbalance in your intestines, C. diff. may begin to grow out of control. The bacteria start to release toxins that irritate and attack the lining of your intestines. This is what leads to symptoms of a C. diff. infection.","C. diff. infections can range from mild to severe.

• Watery diarrhea (3 or more times each day for several days)
• Stomach pain or tenderness

• Frequent, watery diarrhea (up to 15 times each day)
• Severe stomach pain or tendernes
• Nausea
• Loss of appetite
• Low-grade fever of up to 101°F in children or 100°F to 102°F in adults
• Blood or pus in your stool

• Symptoms begin after taking an antibiotic.
• Symptoms last longer than 3 days or get worse.","The most common risk factor for C. diff. is the use of an antibiotics. Antibiotics can disrupt the normal balance in your intestines. Your risk increases if you have taken antibiotics for a long period of time or if the antibiotic is broad-spectrum (treats a wide variety of bacteria)..

People who are 65 years of age or older are at greater risk of a C. diff. infection. Other risk factors include:

• Surgery of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
• Stomach surgery that requires moving the intestines aside.
• A stay in the hospital.
• Living in a nursing home or extended-care facility.
• Colon problems, such as inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) or colorectal cancer.
• Weakened immune system.
• Prior C. diff infection.

If you are in good health, you likely will not get a C. diff. infection","Your doctor will need to test a stool sample to diagnose C. diff. Follow-up tests may be needed to confirm. Your doctor may do an X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan of your colon.

You can test positive for a C. diff. infection without having any symptoms. This is known as C. diff. colonization. Some people are carriers for C. diff. but do not have C. diff. A positive test result plus symptoms indicate that you have an active C. diff. infection.","A C. diff. infection is contagious. The bacteria can spread person to person. They also live a long time on surfaces, such as toilet seats, telephones, and doorknobs. Good hygiene can help you avoid the bacteria.

• Wash your hands often and well, using soap and water.
• Use disposable gloves when caring for someone who may have C.
• Use chlorine bleach-based products to disinfect surfaces and items.
• Wash clothing that may be soiled with stool with soap and chlorine bleach.
• If you visit someone in a health care facility, wash your hands before, during, and after your visit.
• Do not use antibiotics unless your doctor recommends them.

If you have a C. diff. infection, wash your hands with soap and water before eating and after using the restroom. Use a chlorine bleach-based product to clean surfaces you may have touched to avoid spreading the infection to others. About 1 in 5 people who have C. diff. will get it again.","If you were taking an antibiotic when your symptoms started, your doctor will probably ask you to stop taking it. They will watch you for dehydration if you have severe diarrhea. About 25% of patients begin to improve 2 to 3 days after they stop the antibiotic that caused the infection.

For severe cases, your doctor may prescribe a 10-day dose of an antibiotic that has proved effective in treating C. diff. infections. Examples include metronidazole and vancomycin. You should improve after 72 hours of starting the medicine, although the diarrhea may continue. In about 15% to 35% of cases, a second round of antibiotics is needed.

While you recover, drink plenty of fluids to replace what your body lost due to diarrhea. Avoid milk products and foods that contain wheat flour or are high in fiber. Your digestive tract may be sensitive to them for a few days.","If your infection gets worse, you may become dehydrated or be unable to pass stool. In rare cases, C. diff. can lead to sepsis (a life-threatening blood infection) or a puncture in your intestines.

If you have diarrhea and think it could be caused by C. diff., check with your doctor before using antidiarrhea medicine. These drugs can make your infection worse.

Certain probiotics, or “good bacteria,” may help prevent repeat C. diff. infections. Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements. They can instruct what to take along with antibiotics.","• Should I stop taking my antibiotic? At what point?
• If I have diarrhea, when should I call my doctor?
• How did I get a C. diff. infection?
• What treatment is best for me?
• If I’ve had C. diff once, what is my risk of getting it again?
• My mother is in a nursing home that has a breakout of C. diff. Should she be tested?

59,Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cancer/,"Cancer is a collection of many diseases that all involve the growth of abnormal cells. The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow, divide, and then die. Sometimes, cells mutate (change). They begin to grow and divide more quickly than normal cells. Rather than dying, these abnormal cells clump together to form tumors.

Sometimes these tumors are benign (not cancer). But if the cells in these tumors are cancerous (malignant), they can invade and kill your body’s healthy tissues. From these tumors, cancer cells can metastasize (spread) and form new tumors in other parts of the body. Cells in benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body.

There are many different types of cancer. All cancers begin with abnormal cells growing out of control. The type of cancer is determined by what type of cells begin to grow abnormally and where they grow. Cancer cells that grow in the skin are skin cancer. Those that grow in the breast are breast cancer cells. Even if these cancers spread to another part of the body, they are still considered skin or breast cancer. That is because it is the skin or breast cancer cells that spread. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the lungs, it would still be breast cancer. In this case, it would be called metastasized breast cancer.

The most common cancers in adults are skin cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer.","There are many different symptoms of cancer. Often, your symptoms will depend on what kind of cancer you have. For example, a symptom of breast cancer is a lump in the breast. A symptom of skin cancer is an abnormal-looking mole. General symptoms that tend to go with multiple types of cancer include:

• Unexplained weight loss
• Fatigue
• Not feeling “right”
• Blood in the stool or urine
• Lumps anywhere on the body
• Changes in skin appearance, texture, or color anywhere on the body","Cancer is caused by mutations in the DNA in your cells. DNA is what makes up your genes, which give instructions to the cells about what they are supposed to do. When the DNA mutates, it causes errors in the instructions. This makes the cell stop functioning normally. It can lead the cell to become cancerous.

Many things can cause your genes to mutate. Sometimes you are born with a mutation. This means you inherited it from your parents. More commonly, the mutations happen after you’re born. Factors that can cause this include:

• Smoking
• Radiation
• Viruses
• Carcinogens (chemicals that cause cancer)
• Hormones
• Chronic inflammation","There are a variety of tests your doctor will need to do if cancer is suspected:

• Physical exam. Your doctor will give you a thorough physical exam. They will check your body for lumps or tumors. They will check your skin for changes or enlargement of any areas.
• Lab tests. These can include urine and blood tests that can find abnormalities that can be caused by cancer.
• Imaging tests. These tests are not invasive. They take pictures of your bones and the inside of your body. This may include CT scans, bone scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, X-rays, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
• If you have a tumor, your doctor will want to look at the cells inside. They will collect a sample of the cells. There are a variety of ways to do this. These often depend on what kind of cancer is suspected and where it is. A biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose cancer.

If your doctor determines that you have cancer, you will undergo more tests. These will tell the doctor the stage of your cancer. This means the size of the tumor and how far it has spread. The stage of your cancer helps determine what kind of treatment you will have. It also helps the doctor know how likely it is that your cancer can be cured.

Further testing usually includes more imaging tests. These will show if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.","In some cases, cancer is caused by lifestyle choices, such as smoking or not protecting your skin in the outdoors. In those cases, it can be avoided by making better choices. Sometimes the gene mutation that causes it is inherited. Other times, it happens even when you are doing all the right things to lower your risk. In those cases, cancer can’t be prevented. But finding it early can make a big difference in your treatment and your outcome.","The three most common types of cancer treatment are surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Treatment is aimed at removing the cancer cells or destroying them with medicines or by other means.

Some cancers cannot be cured. Some people choose to focus on quality of life and opt not to have treatment. In these cases, they may rely on palliative and hospice care. Palliative care can help provide comfort and treat symptoms. It can begin as early as diagnosis. Hospice care begins nearer the end of life. That is typically when the person is not expected to survive for more than 6 months.

Surgery is a way to physically remove the cancer. Surgery can be very successful in treating some kinds of cancer. But it isn’t an option in all cases. It may be possible to safely remove a tumor and any affected surrounding tissue if:

• The cancer is in the form of a malignant tumor (a tumor that spreads).
• The tumor is still in one place (localized).

Surgery may not be possible if:

• The cancer has spread to other areas of the body.
• The tumor cannot be removed without damaging vital organs, such as the liver or brain.

Radiotherapy uses radiation to damage cancer cells so that they can’t multiply. The radiation is in the form of special X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons. There is usually no pain during this kind of therapy. Depending on the area that is treated, side effects from radiation damage to normal tissues may occur. Your doctor can tell you what to expect. Radiotherapy is sometimes the only treatment needed. It can also be used with other therapies. A combination of surgery and radiotherapy may be used for tumors that grow in one place.

Chemotherapy uses strong medicines to attack the cancer cells. This treatment sometimes causes a lot of fear because the side effects can be severe. However, not all people experience severe side effects. The side effects of chemotherapy can often be treated with other medicines.

Chemotherapy is usually used when the cancer has spread to other areas in the body. It can also be used in combination with surgery and radiation. Sometimes the tumor is surgically removed. Then chemotherapy is used to make sure any remaining cancer cells are killed.

Other specialized treatments may be available. Your doctor may talk to you about these treatments if they are an option for you.","Many kinds of cancer are treatable, especially when detected early. Cancer treatments continue to get better. Life expectancy after a cancer diagnosis is much higher than it used to be.

Living with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Treatments can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying mildly active.

Even after your cancer goes into remission, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. Being in partial remission means you may be able to take a break from treatments as long as the cancer stops growing. If you are in full remission, there is no evidence of the disease still in your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.","• What is the best thing I can do to prevent cancer?

This information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone. Talk to your family doctor to find out if this information applies to you and to get more information on this subject.

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","Everyone has some risk for cancer. In the United States, cancer is likely to affect 1 in 3 people in their lifetime. The amount of risk you have depends on several factors. These factors include:

• Tobacco use
• Lifestyle choices (such as diet and exercise)
• Family history
• Factors in your workplace and environment

Talk to your doctor. They can help you understand your risk for cancer. They can also help you understand how your risk for cancer is affected by the following:

• Using or having used tobacco products, such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco.
• Drinking alcohol.
• Being exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer.
• Being at risk for skin cancer.

Depending on your age and your risk factors, your doctor may begin screening you for certain types of cancer. Screening means looking for certain cancers before they cause any symptoms. Some doctors recommend that people who are at high risk or have a family history of cancer be screened more often, or at a younger age, than people who have average cancer risks. The recommendations for screening vary for different cancers.

Some common cancers are easier to treat if they are found early. If the tumor is found when it is still small and has not yet spread, curing the cancer can be easy. However, the longer the tumor goes unnoticed, the greater the chance that the cancer has spread. This usually makes treatment more difficult.

Unfortunately, some risk factors for cancer (such as family history) are out of your control. But there are things you can do each day to improve your health and lower your risk of cancer. The best ways to lower your cancer risk are to:

• Stop smoking.
• Maintain a healthy weight.
• Be active.
• Eat a healthy diet.
• Limit how much alcohol you drink.
• Limit your exposure to sunlight or tanning beds.

If you are a cancer survivor, these same lifestyle habits can help you stay healthy.

Seeing your doctor regularly can also help. Depending on your age and medical history, your doctor will probably run tests (called screenings) to try to detect the early signs of certain cancers. For most types of cancer, the sooner the cancer is found and treatment begins, the better your chances of recovering."
60,Canker Sores,https://familydoctor.org/condition/canker-sores/,"Canker sores are small, thin sores in your mouth. You might get them on the inside of your lips or cheeks, at the base of your gums, or under your tongue. Canker sores also are called aphthous ulcers.

Canker sores are different from cold sores (also called fever blisters). Cold sores usually are on the outside of your lips or the corners of your mouth.",Canker sores are red and often have a white coating over them. You may have discomfort or pain from the sore.,"Anyone can get canker sores, but people in their teens and 20s get them more often. They are more common in women than men. Doctors don’t know the exact cause of canker sores. Certain things may increase your chance of getting them. These include mouth injuries, stress, poor nutrition, food allergies, viral infections, and hormonal changes. Canker sores may run in families. They aren’t contagious.","Your doctor will look at your sores and review your symptoms. He or she may ask about your health history or take a biopsy of the sore to see if you have a related problem.

You should contact your doctor if your canker sores are:

• Large
• So painful that you can’t eat or drink
• Last longer than 2 weeks

If you have a fever or other sick symptoms when you have canker sores or if you get canker sores more than 3 times a year, you should also contact your doctor.","You can’t prevent or avoid canker sores, since the cause is unknown. However, there are things you can do to reduce mouth irritation. Avoid chewing gum and eating hard or spicy foods. Brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush after meals and floss each day. This keeps your mouth free of food particles that could trigger a canker sore.","The main goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms until the canker sores go away on their own. Pain medicine can help relieve discomfort and possible swelling of the sore. There are some over-the-counter medicines specific to canker sores. Most of these contain a type of numbing agent to relieve pain. They also can protect the sores from irritation caused by eating, drinking, and brushing your teeth. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if one these products may be right for you.

Your doctor may prescribe a topical medicine or special mouthwash to help.

• The medicine goes directly on your canker sores. Dry the sore first using a cotton swab. Then, use a second swab to apply the medicine. You may need to pull out your lip or open your mouth wide to apply. Keep the sore isolated and untouched for several minutes. This allows the medicine to adhere to the sore. Don’t eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes.
• Use the mouthwash the same as you would a normal mouthwash. Swish it around in your mouth, especially around the sores, for a few minutes. Then, spit it out or swallow it, based on the instructions. Don’t use a mouthwash that contains alcohol. It can further irritate the sores.","There is no cure for canker sores. They usually go away on their own in 7 to 10 days. Treatment can speed this up and/or relieve symptoms. Talk to your doctor if you get frequent, painful canker sores.","• Are there certain types of food or drink that cause canker sores?
• Are there medicines to prevent canker sores if I get them a lot?","National Institutes of Health: MedlinePlus, Canker Sore

61,Cardiomyopathy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cardiomyopathy/,"Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the muscles in the heart. It causes your heart muscles to become enlarged. The extra thickness and stiffness of the muscles can weaken your heart over time. A weak heart cannot pump blood easily. When your heart has difficulty pumping blood, it can cause irregular heartbeat. It can also cause heart valves problems and even heart failure. People of all ages and races can have cardiomyopathy.

There are various types of cardiomyopathy. They include:

• Dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged ventricles of the heart; common in men and children)
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickened heart muscle; presents in early childhood or early adulthood; often inherited and can be fatal)
• Restrictive cardiomyopathy (stiff or scarred heart muscle; inherited and common in men)
• Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (inherited and common in men)
• Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) (a rare type involving protein deposits)","Symptoms of cardiomyopathy may be the same as the symptoms of heart failure. These include:

• Shortness of breath
• Fatigue
• Coughing
• Trouble breathing, especially while lying down
• Edema (swelling) of the feet, ankles, and legs
• Abdominal bloating
• Chest pain
• Dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting
• Palpitations","Cardiomyopathy can have many causes. It may be caused by:

• Coronary artery disease (blocked arteries)
• High blood pressure
• Infections (particularly certain viruses)
• Certain medicines
• Diabetes
• Thyroid disorders
• Alcohol abuse

Rarely, cardiomyopathy can happen during the last trimester of pregnancy or the first few months after having a baby.","Your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical history. It is important to tell your doctor if someone in your family has cardiomyopathy or another form of heart disease. Some of these conditions can run in families. Your doctor may do tests to see if you are at risk.

Your doctor will also examine you. They may perform some tests on your heart and blood.","Cardiomyopathy can be inherited (it runs in families). You cannot prevent this type of cardiomyopathy. But you can make healthy lifestyle choices to reduce your risk of complications associated with cardiomyopathy.

You can also develop cardiomyopathy as the result of another disease or condition. Sometimes early treatment of that disease can help prevent you from developing cardiomyopathy. Managing your chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, can reduce your risk of cardiomyopathy.

Even though you can’t always prevent cardiomyopathy, you can do things to make it less likely that you’ll have complications related to the disease. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, you should:

• Avoid using alcohol and illegal drugs.
• Get enough sleep and rest.
• Choose heart-healthy foods.
• Exercise or be physically active.
• Quit smoking.
• Manage stress.","Treatment depends on the cause of the cardiomyopathy. For example, if you have high blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help control it.

If you smoke or drink alcohol, your doctor will probably advise you to quit. You may need to lose weight if you are overweight or have obesity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. However, you should check with your doctor before starting an exercise program.

Your doctor may prescribe medicine to treat cardiomyopathy. They may also suggest that you eat less than 2,300 mg of salt or less per day. Sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure and heart disease.

If you have significant heart failure, you may need a small device that is like a pacemaker to help your heart work correctly. You will need surgery to place the device in your body.

In serious cases, a person who has cardiomyopathy may need a heart transplant. A cardiologist (heart specialist) can help you and your doctor make that decision.","Some people who have cardiomyopathy have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. If you fall into this category, you may not need treatment. Talk to your doctor about monitoring your disease.

If you have moderate or severe symptoms, work with your doctor to control them. Make recommended lifestyle changes. Take medicines as prescribed by your doctor. Doing these things can help control your symptoms and even prevent the disease from getting worse.","• What is the likely cause of my cardiomyopathy?
• If another condition is causing my cardiomyopathy, will treating that condition cure me of my symptoms?
• What is the best treatment for me? Medicine? Surgery?
• Do I need to make any lifestyle changes?
• Am I at risk of heart failure?
• Will I need a heart transplant?","American Heart Association: Cardiomyopathy

62,Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful disorder of the wrist and hand. The carpal tunnel is a narrow tunnel formed by the bones and other tissues of your wrist. This tunnel protects your median nerve. The median nerve helps you move your thumbs and the first 3 fingers on each hand.

Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when other tissues in the carpal tunnel (such as ligaments and tendons) get swollen or inflamed. When they do, they press against the median nerve. That pressure can make part of your hand hurt or feel numb.

Carpal tunnel syndrome usually isn’t serious. With treatment, the pain will typically go away and you’ll have no lasting damage to your hand or wrist.","The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include the following:

• Numbness or tingling in your hand and fingers, especially the thumb, index, and middle fingers.
• Pain in your wrist, palm, or forearm. You may shake or rub your hand to get relief.
• More numbness or pain at night than during the day. It may be so bad that it wakes you up.
• Pain that increases when you use your hand or wrist more.
• Trouble gripping objects, such as a doorknob or the steering wheel of a car.
• Weakness in your thumb.","Doing the same hand movements over and over can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s most common in people whose jobs require pinching or gripping with the wrist held bent. People at risk include people who use computers, carpenters, grocery checkers, assembly-line workers, meat packers, musicians, and mechanics. Hobbies such as gardening, needlework, golfing, and canoeing can sometimes bring on the symptoms.

Women are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome than men. It also tends to be hereditary. This means it runs in families.

Carpal tunnel syndrome may also be caused by an injury to the wrist, such as a fracture. Or it may be caused by a disease such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or thyroid disease. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also common during the last few months of pregnancy.","Your doctor will probably ask you about your symptoms. He or she may examine you and ask you how you use your hands. Your doctor may also do these tests:

• Your doctor may tap the inside of your wrist. You may feel pain or a sensation that feels like an electric shock.
• Your doctor may ask you to bend your wrist down for 1 minute to see if this causes symptoms.

Your doctor may order a nerve conduction test or an electromyography (EMG) test. They use these tests to see whether the nerves and muscles in your arm and hand show the typical effects of carpal tunnel syndrome.","You can take steps to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. The following actions may help to prevent it:

• Lose weight if you’re overweight.
• Get treatment for any disease you have that may cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
• If you do the same tasks over and over with your hands, try not to bend, extend, or twist your hands for long periods of time.
• Don’t work with your arms too close or too far from your body.
• Don’t rest your wrists on hard surfaces for long periods of time.
• Switch hands during work tasks.
• Make sure the tools you use aren’t too big for your hands.
• Take regular breaks from repeated hand movements to give your hands and wrists time to rest.
• If you use a keyboard a lot, adjust the height of your chair so that your forearms are level with your keyboard, and you don’t have to flex your wrists to type.

Many products you can buy, such as wrist rests for a computer keyboard, are supposed to ease symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. No one has proven that these products really prevent wrist problems. Some people may have less pain and numbness after using these products, but other people may have increased pain and numbness.","If carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by a medical problem (such as rheumatoid arthritis), your doctor should treat that problem first. Your doctor may ask you to rest your wrist or change how you use your hand. He or she may also ask you to wear a splint on your wrist. The splint keeps your wrist from moving but lets your hand do most of what it normally does. A splint can help ease the pain of carpal tunnel syndrome, especially at night.

Putting ice on your wrist to reduce swelling, massaging the area, and doing stretching exercises may also help. An over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can relieve swelling and pain. These medicines include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). In more severe cases, your doctor might inject your wrist with a corticosteroid, which reduces inflammation and pain.

In some cases, surgery is needed to make the symptoms go away completely. The surgery involves cutting the ligament that may be pressing on your median nerve. You’ll usually get back the normal use of your wrist and hand within a few weeks to a few months after surgery.

Doing the hand, wrist, and finger exercises that your doctor tells you to do after surgery is very important. Without exercise, your wrist may get stiff, and you may lose some use of your hand.","You may decide against having surgery for your carpal tunnel syndrome. If so, here are some things that may help relieve your symptoms.

• Prop up your arm with pillows when you lie down.
• Avoid overusing the affected hand.
• Find a new way to use your hand by using a different tool.
• Try to use the unaffected hand more often.
• Avoid holding your wrists in a downward bent position for long periods of time.","• How do you know that carpal tunnel syndrome is causing my symptoms?
• What can I do to relieve my pain?
• Are there any special exercises I can do to strengthen my hand and wrist?
• What is the best treatment option? Will I need surgery?
• How long will it take to recover?
• Is it likely that I’ll experience this problem again, either in this hand/arm or in my other hand/arm?","National Institutes of Health: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

63,Cat-Scratch Disease (Cat-Scratch Fever),https://familydoctor.org/condition/cat-scratch-disease/,"Cat-scratch disease is an infection you can get after a cat scratches, bites, or licks you. It is caused by bacteria in cat saliva. Cats likely get the bacteria from fleas.

Cat-scratch disease is also called cat-scratch fever. It is not a severe illness in healthy people. But it can be a problem for young children or people with weak immune systems. These include people with cancer, diabetes, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).","A red bump, sore, or blister may develop where a cat has bitten or scratched you. This could happen 3 to 10 days after the bite or scratch. The sore or blister may take a long time to heal. You may experience a low-grade fever (under 102°F), headache, fatigue, or poor appetite.

An infection of the lymph nodes can also develop. This happens most often in the glands closest to the scratch or bite. If the scratch is on your arm, the glands in your armpit or near your elbow may become tender and swollen.

Call your family doctor if you notice any of the following problems:

• A cat scratch or bite that is not healing.
• A red area around a cat scratch or bite that continues to get bigger for more than 2 days after the injury.
• Fever that lasts for several days after a cat scratch or bite.
• Painful and swollen lymph nodes for more than 2 or 3 weeks.
• Bone or joint pain, abdominal pain (without fever, vomiting, or diarrhea), or excessive tiredness for more than 2 or 3 weeks.","Cat-scratch disease is caused by bacteria that cats carry in their saliva. They likely get the bacteria from fleas. They can spread it to their paws or fur when they lick themselves. You can get cat-scratch disease from a cat biting, scratching, or licking you. You can also get the bacteria in your eyes if you rub them after petting a cat that has the bacteria on its fur. Many people who get cat-scratch disease do not remember being scratched or bitten by a cat.","Your doctor will examine the bite or scratch and ask you about your symptoms. He or she will check your lymph nodes for swelling or tenderness. If a diagnosis is not clear, they may order a blood test.","You can prevent cat-scratch disease in the following ways:

• Wash your hands carefully after handling your cat.
• Play gently with your cat so they don’t scratch or bite you.
• Don’t let your cat lick you, especially around the mouth, nose, eyes, or open wounds.
• Control fleas to decrease the chance that your cat will contract the bacteria.
• Don’t tease or provoke a cat.
• Avoid petting stray or feral cats.

Young cats are more likely to carry the bacteria than older cats. Households with kittens have higher rates of infection. If the kittens have fleas, the infection rate is even higher. If you are planning to adopt a cat, consider a cat that is at least 1 year old.","In most people, cat-scratch disease clears up without treatment. You can take an over-the-counter pain reliever to help relieve pain and discomfort. Ibuprofen (two brands: Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (one brand: Aleve) can help. Applying heat compresses to the affected area may also help. If a lymph node is very large or painful, your doctor may drain it to help relieve the pain.

Antibiotics may be needed if your symptoms don’t go away in a month or two. In rare cases, the infection can travel to your bones, liver, or other organs. This requires more intensive treatment.

Most cats with the bacteria do not get sick or need treatment. Rarely, they could develop inflammation of the heart that could make it hard for them to breathe. If you are worried that your cat may be experiencing symptoms from the bacteria, contact your vet.","If you get scratched or bitten by a cat, wash the area with soap and water. Look for signs of infection over the next 2 weeks. Call your doctor if you have symptoms.

In most cases, you can manage your symptoms at home with pain relievers or warm compresses.","• My cat scratched me. Do I need to be seen?

64,Celiac Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/celiac-disease/,"Celiac disease is a digestive disorder that causes problems in your small intestine. You experience the problems when you eat foods that have gluten. Gluten is a protein found in grains like wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is not the same is having gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease.

In people with celiac disease, gluten causes the immune system to attack and damage the small intestine. When this happens, your body doesn’t absorb or get the important nutrients it needs. These include vitamins, calcium, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Your body can’t work well without these nutrients.","Some people with celiac disease don’t notice or have symptoms. But most people do, including:

In infants and young children:

• Digestive trouble, including abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation
• Feeling irritable, fretful, emotionally withdrawn, or excessively dependent
• Failure to grow and gain weight
• Damage to tooth enamel
• Being overweight or having obesity

• Digestive issues such as diarrhea and constipation
• Delayed puberty
• Slowed growth and short height
• Hair loss

• Digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea or constipation (less likely than children)
• General feeling of poor health, including fatigue and bone or joint pain
• Irritability, anxiety, and depression
• Missed menstrual periods in women
• Osteoporosis (loss of calcium from the bones) and anemia

Other common symptoms in people of any age include:

• Lactose intolerance: A problem digesting milk products
• Dermatitis herpetiformis: An itchy, blistery skin problem
• Canker sores in the mouth","Doctors and researchers don’t know exactly what causes celiac disease. It’s more common in people who:

• Have a family member with celiac disease. If 1 member of your family has it, about 1 out of 10 other family members likely has it.
• Have an autoimmune disease. This could include type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroid or liver disease, Addison’s disease, or Sjogren’s syndrome.
• Have a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome or Turner syndrome.

If you have celiac disease, you probably won’t know right away. You may have this disease without getting sick. It could be triggered later on by severe stress, physical injury, infection, childbirth, or surgery.","Celiac disease can be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are similar to other digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome. But blood tests can help your doctor diagnose this disease.

If your blood test indicates that you might have celiac disease, an intestinal biopsy is often done. Using a thin tube, the doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your small intestine. Positive biopsy results will confirm you have celiac disease.

Diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis—a chronic skin condition caused by a reaction to gluten ingestion—will also confirm it.

Don’t stop eating gluten before you have a blood test or a biopsy. If you do, it can skew your results.",There is no way to prevent or avoid getting celiac disease.,"Celiac disease is serious. Fortunately, you can control the disease by following a gluten-free diet. This means you remove gluten completely from your diet. By doing this, you can reverse the damage caused by celiac disease. You’ll feel better. But if you “cheat” on your diet, the damage will come back. Sometimes you may not feel sick right away, so you think it’s okay to eat gluten. But it’s not.

People who follow a gluten-free diet avoid all foods that contain:

• Wheat
• Barley
• Spelt
• Triticale products (including many breads, pastas, cereals, and processed foods)

Foods that don’t contain gluten and are safe to eat include:

• Quinoa
• Buckwheat
• Millet

Some oat products can be contaminated with wheat gluten. Because of this, some people choose to avoid oats.

Gluten sometimes appears in foods or places you wouldn’t expect:

• It’s used as a thickening agent in many gravies and sauces.
• It’s sometimes used in medicines. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking a new medicine. This includes vitamins and supplements.
• It can be found in lip balm, lipstick, and other cosmetics.

Celiac disease and other gluten sensitivities have become more well-known. Gluten-free eating has become more mainstream. Many restaurants offer gluten-free options. Many grocery stores have gluten-free sections. These mean plenty of gluten-free products can be found.","Learning to be gluten free may be hard at first. It will take time for you and your family to learn how to avoid gluten. You’ll have to learn to read ingredient labels at the grocery store. You’ll have to be careful when you eat out. You’ll probably have to learn some new cooking recipes.

If you’re looking for help, there are many resources available. Books and websites provide information, tips, and recipes for gluten-free living. Your local celiac disease support group is a good source of information and support. You may also find it helpful to meet with a registered dietician. He or she can help you learn what foods to avoid, how to read food labels, and how to make healthy substitutions.

65,Cellulitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cellulitis/,"Cellulitis is a skin infection that is caused by bacteria. It is a common infection but can become a serious condition if not treated. Most of the time, cellulitis affects the skin on your lower legs. But it can appear anywhere on your body and even on your face. The infection begins on the surface of your skin, but can affect the underlying layers of skin, too. Untreated, cellulitis can even spread to your lymph nodes or cause a blood infection (sepsis).","Cellulitis is usually painful. The affected area will be red and possibly inflamed (swollen). It may also feel warm to the touch.

Other common symptoms include:

• Skin on the affected area may look glossy or seem “stretched.”
• The area may have a sore that grows quickly, especially within the first day. It may be leaky or have pus.
• You have a general feeling of being sick.
• You are feeling tired.

More serious symptoms that could mean the infection is spreading:

• Fever or chills
• Nausea and vomiting
• Red streaks around the area
• A loss of energy or feeling especially tired or sleepy
• Increased pain

If you have any of these symptoms, you should contact your doctor immediately or seek emergency care.","Cellulitis is caused by bacteria. It is normal for bacteria to live on your skin. When you have a break in your skin, those bacteria can enter and cause an infection. A break in your skin can be caused by many things. It could happen when you scratch dry skin, when an insect bites you, or you accidentally bump up against something that scrapes your skin.",Your doctor will most likely be able to tell that you have cellulitis by looking at your skin. They will also feel your glands to see if they are swollen. Your doctor may want to order some blood tests to make sure the infection hasn’t spread to your blood. They could also collect fluid from the affected area to test it.,"Cellulitis cannot always be prevented. You can lower your risk for cellulitis by moisturizing and taking care of your skin. You should also wash your hands often and keep your fingernails trimmed.

If you have a skin wound, make sure to keep it clean. You should wash it daily or use an antiseptic or antibiotic cream to lower the risk of infection. Look at it every day for possible signs of infection. If you see that the wound is growing or becoming more painful, contact your doctor.

Certain illnesses or conditions may increase your risk for getting cellulitis. If you have diabetes or vascular disease, you may have more breaks in your skin in the form of ulcers. Eczema can cause more breaks in your skin, too. You may also be at higher risk if you use medicines that could suppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids. Obesity can also increase your risk for cellulitis.","Your doctor will most likely prescribe oral antibiotics to treat your cellulitis. They also may offer you pain medicine, if needed.

If your infection is more severe, your doctor may recommend that you go to the hospital for intravenous (IV) antibiotics. This is liquid medicine delivered directly into your vein (usually an arm vein) using a needle. Other reasons your doctor may recommend this treatment include:

• Oral antibiotics are not working.
• Your cellulitis covers a large area of skin.
• You have a high fever.
• You are especially young or old.
• You have other diseases or conditions.","In most cases, cellulitis goes away with antibiotic treatment. It is rare for it to spread to your bloodstream, but it can happen. That is why it is important to keep an eye on rashes and wounds. Cellulitis can return if you have a disease or condition that makes you prone to wounds or nicks in your skin. Good wound care and washing your hands can help keep the infection from spreading.","• How did I get this infection?
• How can I prevent this infection in the future?

66,Central Precocious Puberty,https://familydoctor.org/condition/central-precocious-puberty/,"Puberty is the time of life when boys’ and girls’ bodies begin to develop or mature. Puberty involves sexual, physical, and emotional changes. Children go through puberty on their own time. Normally, it begins for girls between the ages of 8 and 13. In boys, it begins between the ages of 9 and 14.

Precocious puberty refers to early onset puberty symptoms. Central precocious puberty (CPP) is the more common type. Medically, it is known as gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty. The other type is peripheral (gonadotropin-independent) precocious puberty. A girl younger than 8 years old or a boy younger than 9 years old who has puberty symptoms may have CPP.","The symptoms of CPP are the same as normal puberty. The difference is that they occur at a younger age.

Common puberty symptoms for girls are:

• Breast development
• Pubic or body hair
• Growth spurt
• Body odor
• First menstrual cycle (period)

Common puberty symptoms for boys are:

• Growth of penis and testicles
• Pubic, facial, or body hair
• Growth spurt
• Muscle development
• Body odor
• Voice change (deepening)","In most cases of CPP, the cause is unknown. Potential causes involve health problems that occur in your child’s brain. These include:

• Brain tumor
• Infection of the brain
• Radiation to the brain, such as cancer treatment
• Trauma to the brain
• Other brain defects","Talk to your child’s doctor if you notice early signs of puberty. The doctor will do a physical exam. Blood and urine tests check hormone levels. High levels suggest the onset of puberty. After diagnosis, other tests can be done to determine a cause. The doctor can check your child’s hormones to see if precocious puberty is central or peripheral. MRIs and CT scans scan the brain for any problems. An X-ray checks your child’s bone growth to see if it’s normal",Can central precocious puberty be prevented or avoided. You cannot prevent CPP. Children who are genetically female are at greater risk for CPP. Those who are overweight or have obesity also carry a greater risk.,"Treatment for CPP depends on how early it occurs. If puberty begins slightly before the normal age, your child may not need any treatment. If puberty begins much earlier, the doctor may want to stop it. This can be done with medicines, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa). They lower your child’s sex hormone levels to stop puberty.

Any underlying cause of CPP also needs to be treated. Your doctor will explain options for tumors, infections, trauma, or other causes.","The following complications are possible for children who do not get treatment for CPP:

• Unable to reach full height because body growth stops early.
• Social problems because they go through puberty before kids their age. These include anxiety from being different, depression, and bullying.
• Emotional problems, such as moodiness, defiance, and aggression.
• Early sex drive. Children are not mentally prepared for sex at a young age. This can become a problem if kids act on their impulses.","• How can I tell if my child’s symptoms are due to CPP?
• Does CPP run in families?
• Does my child have to take medicine to stop puberty?
• Can you recommend a support group for my child and I?
• Are there any disorders related to CPP?","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Puberty and Precocious Puberty

67,Cerebral Palsy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cerebral-palsy/,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurological (brain) disorders. These disorders affect body movement and muscle coordination. It usually appears in infancy or early childhood, as the brain develops. Children with CP may have stiff or weak muscles. This can cause them to make unusual muscle movements. It may take a baby with CP longer than usual to start rolling over, sitting up, crawling, or walking.

CP can be mild or severe. A child with mild CP may have awkward movements but require little or no assistance. A child with severe CP may not be able to walk. He or she may have trouble speaking and may require lifelong care and assistance.

There are 3 general types of CP:

• Spastic CP is the most common form. It causes the muscles to stiffen and makes movement difficult. It can affect just one side of the body, only the legs, or the whole body. This depends on the type of spastic CP and the severity.
• Dyskinetic CP causes uncontrolled body movements. These can be slow or fast and jerky. It affects the entire body.
• Ataxic CP affects balance, coordination, and depth perception. It is the least common form of CP.

Some children will show signs of more than one type of CP. This is referred to as mixed CP.

Many children with CP have other conditions as well. Some of the most common include:

• Intellectual disability or learning difficulties
• Seizures
• Delayed growth and development
• Spinal deformities
• Vision or hearing loss
• Speech disorders
• Infections and long-term illnesses","Children with CP show a wide variety of symptoms. The symptoms usually do not get worse over time. They may include:

• Stiff muscles or muscles that are too floppy
• Uncontrolled movements
• Lack of coordination
• Difficulty walking (for example, one foot or leg may drag)
• Difficulty with fine motor control (for example, difficulty with writing or buttoning a shirt)
• Difficulty speaking, swallowing, or eating
• Excessive drooling
• Seizures

Signs of CP usually show up in the first few months of a baby’s life. They often are signs of developmental delay. This means they don’t reach developmental milestones in the typical time. These milestones include learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk.","CP is caused by abnormal brain development or brain injury. The brain damage can occur before the child is born. It can also occur during birth or in the first few years of life. In most cases, CP is present at birth.

Normally, the brain sends out messages telling the body exactly how and when to move. Children with CP have damage to the part of the brain that sends out these messages. This affects the way a child who has CP talks, walks, and moves.

Certain infections in the pregnant mother can increase the risk of brain damage in the developing baby and cause CP. These infections include rubella or chickenpox. Sometimes, a baby’s brain does not develop properly in the womb. This can also lead to CP. Doctors don’t know for sure why this happens. In some cases it can be associated with the mother’s exposure to certain toxic substances.

A difficult labor or delivery can cause CP. This can happen if there is a lack of oxygen to the baby’s brain during birth. Severe jaundice that is left untreated in newborns can also result in CP.

Meningitis or viral encephalitis in children can lead to CP. Meningitis causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Viral encephalitis causes inflammation of the brain.

CP can also be caused by brain injuries during the first few months or years of life. These could be from an accident or from being shaken.

In many cases, the cause of a child’s CP is never found.

Some things can increase the risk of a baby developing CP. Risk factors include:

• Infection, such as rubella, in a pregnant mother
• Problems with blood circulation in the brain before birth
• Abnormal brain development
• Premature birth or low birth weight
• Babies in a feet-first (breech) position at the beginning of labor
• Difficult labor and delivery or delivery of multiple babies
• Exposure to toxic substances in a pregnant mother
• Severe jaundice in newborns
• Infections in the baby after birth, such as bacterial meningitis
• Head injuries after birth","CP is often diagnosed in the first two years of a child’s life. Your doctor will look at your child’s muscles, posture, and reflexes. They will ask you about your child’s physical development. They may monitor your child over time, tracking their growth and development. They may also order special tests, such as a CT scan or an MRI. These can help the doctor see if there is any damage to the brain. These tests can also help your doctor determine if your child’s symptoms are the result of a different disorder.

Children with milder symptoms may not be diagnosed until they are 4 or 5.","Some cases of CP cannot be prevented. They are the result of complications that happen during pregnancy or birth that could not be foreseen.

The best way to prevent CP is to take measures to lower the risk factors. You can do this by:

• Maintaining your physical health during your pregnancy. This includes eating a healthy diet, exercising, and getting plenty of rest.
• Taking folic acid. It has been shown to prevent premature birth, which is associated with CP. It also helps with neurological development.
• Attending all prenatal doctor appointments. Tell your doctor if anything doesn’t feel right.
• Avoiding unhealthy habits. This includes drinking alcohol, smoking, or using drugs.
• Watching for jaundice after the baby is born. Untreated jaundice (yellow skin) could lead to CP.
• Keeping your baby current on vaccinations. Some preventable illnesses, such as rubella (German measles), can cause CP.
• Avoiding potential injury or accidents. Always fasten your child securely into his or her car seat when traveling in the car. Don’t ever shake your baby. This can cause brain injury that could result in CP. Make sure anyone who watches your baby is trustworthy and won’t shake or harm your baby.","There is no cure for CP. If your child has CP, your doctor will help you create a treatment plan. Treatment should improve his or her skills. The plan may include:

• Physical therapy: Exercise and muscle training will help your child with balance, flexibility, coordination, and strength. It can help your child learn to use assistive devices. These could include crutches, braces, splints, or a wheelchair if necessary.
• Speech therapy: A speech therapist can help your child with speaking or sign language, swallowing, and eating.
• Occupational therapy: This teaches your child how to help take care of themselves. It can help teach your child to perform daily activities at home or school. It also helps your child learn or improve fine motor skills, such as writing.
• Medicines: Your doctor may prescribe muscle relaxants to ease muscle stiffness. If your child has seizures, your doctor may suggest an anticonvulsant.
• Surgery: Your child’s muscles or tendons could be very stiff. This limits the range of motion in the arms or legs. In these cases, your doctor may recommend surgery.","Many people with CP are in treatment for most of their lives. Some use other methods to help manage their disease. Orthotic devices help stabilize movement. These could include braces, wedges, special chairs, rolling walkers, or powered scooters. Many assistive devices have been developed to help people with CP and other disabling diseases. These include computers, software, voice synthesizers, and picture books to help with communication.

Many parents explore complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for their children. Although the FDA hasn’t approved these therapies, some parents have reported positive results. Some alternative therapies include:

• Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
• Electrical stimulation
• Specialized learning strategies
• Stem cell therapy","• Where can I get help and support in my community?

68,Cervical Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cervical-cancer/,Cervical cancer is abnormal growth of cells in a woman’s cervix. The cervix is the lowest part of the uterus (womb). It connects the uterus and the vagina. Cervical cancer is almost always caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).,"In its early stages, cervical cancer may not have any symptoms. This is the case with many cancers. In later stages, symptoms could include:

• Unusual vaginal bleeding (not during your menstrual cycle)
• Abnormal vaginal discharge
• Pelvic pain
• Pain during sex

These could also be signs of a condition other than cervical cancer. If you experience any of these symptoms, see your family doctor.",Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV. This is a common sexually transmitted virus that can cause infections. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Some types cause no symptoms. Others cause body warts or genital warts. More aggressive kinds can cause cancer in both women and men. Cervical cancer is the most common kind of cancer caused by HPV.,"Abnormal results from a routine Pap test (or smear) could lead to a cervical cancer diagnosis. During a Pap test, your doctor takes a sample of cells from your cervix. The sample is sent to a lab and checked under a microscope.

Abnormal Pap test results could mean there are changes in the cells on your cervix, including:

• Inflammation (irritation). This can be caused by an infection of the cervix. These include yeast infections, HPV, the herpes virus, or many other infections.
• Abnormal cells. These changes are called cervical dysplasia. The cells are not cancerous but may be precancerous. This means they could eventually turn into cancer.
• More serious signs of cancer. These changes affect the top layers of the cervix, but don’t go beyond the cervix.
• More advanced cancer. These cell changes extend into tissues beyond the cervix.

If the results of your Pap test are abnormal, your doctor may repeat the test. He or she may also do a cervical HPV test. This test can show if you have one of the types of HPV that can cause cancer. Your doctor may want you to have a colposcopy. During this procedure, he or she will use a magnifying lens to look more closely at your cervix. They can also take a sample of tissue (biopsy) to test for cancer.

Cells of the cervix go through many changes before they turn into cancer. A Pap test can show if your cells are going through these changes. If caught and treated early, cervical cancer is not life threatening. This is why it is so important that you get regular Pap tests.

All women should get regular Pap tests. These can detect abnormal cells before they turn into cancer.

Certain things put you at higher or lower risk for cervical cancer. Your doctor will consider these when recommending how often you should have a Pap test. Most women can follow these guidelines:

• Every 3 years beginning at 21 years of age and continuing until 65 years of age.
• If you are between 30 and 65 years of age, you might be able to combine a Pap test with HPV testing every 5 years.
• If you are older than 65, ask your doctor if you still need regular Pap tests.","In many cases, cervical cancer can be prevented. The best ways to do this are to avoid getting HPV and to get regular Pap tests.

An HPV vaccine can protect young people against the virus. The vaccine is FDA-approved for all boys and girls between 9 years and 26 years of age. It is most effective when you get it before you have been exposed to HPV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that girls and boys who are 11 or 12 get the vaccine. But anyone age 26 or younger should get the vaccine, even if you’ve already had HPV.

Other ways to lower your risk of getting HPV include:

• Limit your number of sex partners.
• Don’t have sex with someone who has had a lot of partners.
• Use condoms anytime you have sex. (Remember, condoms aren’t 100% effective. HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact. This makes condoms less reliable for prevention.)","In many cases, precancerous cells are found before cancer develops. Treatment for these is different than for invasive cancer cells.","Cervical cancer is treatable, especially when detected early. Precancerous cells can be removed before they develop into cancer. Early treatment often does not affect your ability to have children. Treatment of more advanced cancers could require removal of the uterus or other reproductive organs. Some women have their eggs frozen for future use before undergoing this kind of surgery.

Cancer treatments can be stressful. Treatments can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying mildly active.

Even after your cancer goes into remission, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.","• How often do I need a Pap test?

These include severity, age, general health, desire to get pregnant in the future, and preference. Options include cryosurgery (freezing), cauterization (burning), or laser surgery. These procedures destroy the abnormal cells without causing much damage to nearby healthy tissue.

This means that the cancer has spread from the surface of the cervix. It may spread to tissue deeper within the cervix or to other parts of the body. Treatment options depend on the size of the tumor and how far the cancer has spread. They also may depend on your plans for having children in the future. The most common treatments include:

• Surgery — The cancerous tissue is removed in an operation.
• Radiation —High-energy rays like X-rays shrink or kill the cancerous cells.
• Chemotherapy — Powerful medicines, in pill form or injected into the veins, shrink or kill the cancer.

Treatment of invasive cancer often involves a team of specialists. This could include your family doctor, a gynecologist, and an oncologist (cancer specialist). You will all work together to develop the best treatment plan for you."
69,Cervical Dysplasia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cervical-dysplasia/,"Cervical dysplasia is when there are abnormal, or precancerous, cells in and around a woman’s cervix. The vagina opens up into the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus.

Cervical dysplasia is detected by a pap test (pap smear). It’s diagnosed with a biopsy. Abnormal changes in cells can be mild, moderate, or severe. The presence of abnormal cells doesn’t mean you have cervical cancer. But the cells could lead to cancer if they aren’t treated.",People with cervical dysplasia don’t usually have symptoms. This is why it’s important to get screened regularly. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends routine pap tests to diagnose cervical cancer early. You can check AAFP’s clinical guidelines (at the end of this article) to see when and how often you should be tested.,"The cells on your cervix can change over time. This means that you can develop cervical dysplasia at almost any age.

HPV is the primary cause of cervical dysplasia. There are more than 200 different HPV viruses. About 40 of these affect the genitals. The viruses are spread through sexual contact. Most viruses are low risk for cancer. About 12 are high risk. High-risk HPV types 16 and 18 cause about 70 percent of cervical cancer cases.

In the United States, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection.

There are several factors that can increase your risk of cervical dysplasia:

• Becoming sexually active before age 18
• Having a high number of sexual partners
• Having illnesses or using medicines that lower your immune system
• Smoking or chewing tobacco
• Not using condoms (while condoms help prevent HPV, they don’t fully protect you)
• Giving birth before age 16
• Not getting the HPV vaccine","Cervical dysplasia is typically detected during a routine pap test. For this test, your doctor swabs your cervix to collect a sample of cells. This is generally not painful. The cells are then sent to a lab. It can take up to 3 weeks for the lab to process the test.

The pap test results can be normal, inconclusive, or abnormal. If normal, you should follow AAFP’s recommendation for regular pap tests.

Inconclusive results don’t indicate cervical dysplasia. You could have a simple infection in your cervix or vagina. Your doctor may order a repeat pap test. Further action or diagnoses will depend on your age and medical history.

An abnormal result is known as cervical dysplasia. It’s called a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). On the pap test, the precancerous cells may be classified as:

• Low-grade SIL (LSIL), indicating mild abnormality
• High-grade SIL (HSIL), indicating moderate to severe abnormality
• Atypical glandular or squamous cells (ASCUS)

Additional testing is needed to see if the cell changes are mild, moderate, or severe. A colposcopy is an in-office procedure that gives your doctor a closer look at your cervix. He or she may take a biopsy of the cervix to help identify the abnormal area. These biopsies are small and don’t cause much discomfort.

Cervical dysplasia that is found on a biopsy is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). There are 3 levels:

• CIN I (mild dysplasia)
• CIN II (moderate to marked dysplasia)
• CIN III (severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ)

An HPV test can be completed at the same time or separately as the pap test. It will identify the presence and type of HPV.","The best way to prevent cervical dysplasia is to get the HPV vaccine. It’s proven to lower your risk of HPV. It doesn’t fully prevent cervical dysplasia. Consult your doctor to know if you meet all criteria for the vaccine. For best results, girls and boys between the ages of 9 and 26 should get vaccinated before becoming sexually active. However, vaccination can be helpful after onset of sexual activity and up to age 45. Consult your doctor to discuss the vaccine criteria and if you should be vaccinated.

You can also take the following steps to reduce your risk of developing cervical dysplasia:

• Get the HPV vaccine if you’re between the ages of 9 and 26.
• Don’t smoke.
• Delay the onset of sexual activity as long as possible or until you are in a long-term relationship.
• Use a condom whenever you have sex.
• Have as few sexual partners as possible.","Treatment for cervical dysplasia will depend on the degree of abnormal cells and your medical history. Most mild cases will clear up without treatment. Your doctor may suggest getting a pap test every 6 to 12 months, instead of every 3 to 5 years. But if the changes don’t go away or get worse, treatment will be needed.

Instances of moderate or severe cervical dysplasia could require immediate treatment. Options include:

• Cryosurgery to freeze off the abnormal cervical tissue
• LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) to burn off the abnormal cells with an electric looped wire
• Surgery to remove the abnormal cells with a laser, scalpel, or both

Rare cases of severe cervical dysplasia could require a hysterectomy to fully remove the cervix.","Early diagnosis and prompt treatment cures most cases of cervical dysplasia. Follow your doctor’s and AAFP’s screening recommendations for early detection.

Once treated, cervical dysplasia can return. People who have severe cervical dysplasia, high-risk HPV, or whose condition goes untreated could develop cervical cancer.","• Can I get the HPV vaccine?
• How can I prevent cervical dysplasia?
• Does cervical dysplasia or HPV affect my chances of getting pregnant?

70,Cervical Dystonia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cervical-dystonia/,"Cervical dystonia is a neurological disorder that causes the muscles in your neck to contract involuntarily. That means without you making them move. This muscle contraction can make your head lean or twist to one side. Your chin may pull up, down, forward, or backward. Your shoulder also can contort up.

The disorder is more common in men than women. It’s more likely to develop during middle age, although it can happen at any age.

The disorder also is known as spasmodic torticollis (ST). It can cause severe pain and discomfort. It often begins slowly, gets worse, and then stabilizes.","The main symptom is involuntary muscle contractions in your neck. Other symptoms include:

• Burning pain in your neck and shoulder
• Severe headaches
• Spasms and/or tremors","In many instances, doctors don’t know what causes cervical dystonia. In some cases, people who have a neck injury may develop it. When the cause isn’t known, it’s called primary dystonia.

Secondary dystonia can be caused by disease or injury, such as a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or Parkinson’s disease. You may develop it if there’s a problem with your basal ganglia. This is the part of your brain that sends messages to start muscle movement. Nerve damage from certain medicines is another possible cause.

Both primary and secondary cervical dystonia can be genetic, meaning it runs in families.","Your doctor will review your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They also will want to know about any health problems or disorders you may have. Your doctor may want to do some tests to see how your muscles work. These tests can detect the underlying cause of your muscle contractions. Cervical dystonia can resemble stiff neck, an acute pain, or spasm that goes away.",Cervical dystonia can’t be prevented or avoided.,"There are several treatment options for cervical dystonia. Medicines can help your neck muscles relax and reduce spasms. These include muscle relaxers and certain medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease. Injections may also help.

Your doctor may recommend physical therapy. This includes exercises to stretch and strengthen your muscles. Physical therapy can reduce pain and improve neck posture and movement. Massage and practices to reduce stress also can help with pain and discomfort. Some people use neck or head braces for support.

Severe cases may require surgery. Selective denervation surgery cuts the nerves to the affected muscles. Deep brain stimulation surgery uses electrical pulses to correct your nerves.","Cervical dystonia is a lifelong disorder. There is no cure. However, it doesn’t lower your expected life span. Some people may experience lengths of time without any symptoms. That means they’re in remission. If your cervical dystonia causes you pain, work with your doctor to help control it.

There is a small chance of getting dystonia in other parts of your body. It can affect muscles that you voluntarily control.

Try to minimize stress in your life. Even though stress doesn’t cause dystonia, your symptoms may be worse when you’re feeling stressed.","• My mother had cervical dystonia. Am I at risk of getting it? Can I pass it to my children?

71,Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM),https://familydoctor.org/condition/cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy/,"What is cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM)?

Your spinal cord is a group of nerves that runs from your head to your lower back. The cervical spine is the part in your neck. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a compression of the spinal cord in your neck. A compression of the spinal cord means pressure, pinching, or squeezing on it.

CSM often affects adults 40 years or older. It can affect younger people born with narrow spinal canals and men at an earlier age than women.","Symptoms of CSM are wide-ranging and occur over time. They can include:

• Neck pain or stiffness
• Arm pain
• Numbness in your hands or weakness of your arms and legs
• Trouble using your hands or walking
• Loss of bladder or bowel control","Changes in the bones, discs, and ligaments of your spine as you age can cause pressure on the spinal cord. Sometimes growths called bone spurs add pressure to the spine. These changes often occur due to normal aging. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause CSM as well as spinal cord trauma.","Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They will look for changes in your feeling, strength, and reflexes. Your doctor also will do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test. This uses radio waves to take pictures of your spine. The test can confirm if you have spinal cord compression in your neck. It also can show other problems that have similar symptoms to CSM. Your doctor may have to do other tests to confirm the cause of CSM. One of these tests may be a CT scan. They also may refer you to an orthopedist or neurosurgeon.",You can’t prevent CSM. It’s caused by a natural breakdown of the body as you age.,"Mild cases of CSM can be treated with neck braces, physical therapy, and pain relief medicine. These treatments help some symptoms but may not provide long-term relief. They also don’t help other symptoms, such as weakness or numbness. Severe cases may require surgery. This can help reduce or relieve the compression of your spinal cord.","CSM can get worse if left untreated. Talk to your doctor to create a treatment plan to manage your symptoms.

• What types of medicines are used to treat CSM? Do they have side effects?
• What can I do to ease the symptoms of CSM?
• What can I do to prevent CSM from getting worse?
• Can CSM be a sign of another health condition?

72,Chickenpox,https://familydoctor.org/condition/chickenpox/,"Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It is most common in children. The classic symptom is an itchy rash of red spots all over the body. Your child could have as many as 250 to 500 red spots before the virus runs its course in 5 to 7 days.

Chickenpox used to be a common childhood disease. Then a vaccine was invented to prevent it. Now there are many fewer cases.","You may not know your child has chickenpox at first. They may have flu-like symptoms to start off with. These include:

• fever
• drowsiness
• poor appetite
• headache
• sore throat
• stomachache

Several days later, the rash appears. It usually starts on the child’s stomach, back, and face before spreading to his or her entire body. In more severe cases, the spots can move inside your child’s throat, eyes, bottom, and vagina. The spots begin as raised bumps, turn into fluid-filled blisters, and end as scabs. They are extremely itchy. Scratching causes the blisters to break open. This can lead to infection and scars.

Most cases of chickenpox are mild. Symptoms last 5 to 7 days.","Chickenpox is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. You can catch it by coming in contact with someone who is infected. It is spread through touching or breathing in virus particles that have come from the blisters.

A person with chickenpox is contagious from 1 to 2 days before they develop the rash. The can pass on the disease until all of their blisters have formed scabs. This usually takes 5 to 7 days.

The varicella-zoster virus also causes a disease called shingles. This is a painful skin condition that lays dormant until you get older. It also appears as an itchy, sore rash with blisters. If you have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine, you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles.","Your doctor can generally tell if the rash is chickenpox just by looking at it. He or she may check for other flu-like symptoms. They also can test blood or test a small sample from one of the blisters.

You should call your doctor if your child:

• Has difficulty breathing.
• Has a fever that lasts for more than 4 days or spikes beyond 102°.
• Has blisters with yellow fluid coming out from the sores.
• Has blisters that feel warm or look swollen.
• Has a severe headache.
• Is unusually sleepy or has difficulty waking up.
• Is bothered by bright lights.
• Has trouble walking.
• Is confused.
• Is vomiting, is extremely nauseated, or has a stiff neck.","The best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the vaccine. Children should receive the vaccination when they are 12 to 15 months old. They should get a booster vaccination between ages 4 and 6. The vaccine is 99 percent effective in protecting against the virus. On rare occasions, children who get the vaccine may still get chickenpox. But their case is usually milder than if they hadn’t gotten the vaccine.

Chickenpox is an airborne virus. It can also be spread through mucus, saliva, or by touching the fluid from the blisters. If you know a child who has chickenpox or was recently exposed to the virus, keep your child away from that friend or classmate. Keep your child home once you know he or she has chickenpox. This minimizes spreading it to others.

Adults who escaped chickenpox as a child, but have not gotten the vaccine, are at risk for getting the virus. Getting chickenpox puts you at a higher risk of getting shingles. If you’ve never had chickenpox or the vaccine, talk to your doctor. You can still get vaccinated, even as an adult.","A virus causes chickenpox. That means antibiotics won’t help in treating it. Doctors might prescribe an antibiotic if the spots become infected from scratching. This will depend on the age and health of your child. It will also depend on how bad the chickenpox have become in a 5-to-7-day period.

Some people with chickenpox may need antiviral medicine. Your doctor may recommend antiviral medicine if you:

• Are over the age of 12.
• Have chronic skin or lung disease.
• Receive steroid therapy.
• Are pregnant.

In most cases, the best your doctor can offer is solutions to treat the symptoms. For itching, your doctor may suggest applying a cool, wet cloth to the blisters. Do not rub the sores or they will break open. Cool or lukewarm baths also may help. Many people find that lotions and bathing products made with oatmeal help relieve itching. Using calamine lotion on areas below the face also can provide relief from itching.

If your child has mouth blisters, avoid causing the blisters to break open. Give him or her foods and drinks that are cold, soft, and bland. Topical pain relief creams approved by your doctor also can help. Keeping your child from scratching the sores will be a big challenge. Have them wear mittens or socks on their hands. This will reduce the damage from scratching with their fingernails.

If your child is experiencing pain, you can give them over-the-counter pain medicine. Do not give your child aspirin. It can cause Reye syndrome, which can cause liver failure and death. Acetaminophen (1 brand name: Tylenol) is an acceptable oral pain relief medication.","For the short time you have chickenpox, there’s little you can do other than make yourself as comfortable as possible. Follow the guidelines in the treatment section. Limit your exposure to others.

In most cases, once you have chickenpox, you will not have it again in your lifetime. Rarely, someone may get it more than once.

Some people are at higher risk of developing serious complications from chickenpox. They include those who:

• Are pregnant.
• Have a weakened immune system.
• Are under 1 year old.
• Are over 12 years old.

• Pneumonia
• Infection or inflammation of the brain
• Bleeding problems
• Infection of the blood (sepsis)
• Bacterial infections of the skin
• Dehydration

Some people get so sick from chickenpox that they need to stay in the hospital. In rare cases, chickenpox can cause death.","• How do I keep myself and others from catching chickenpox if we haven’t had a vaccine or the virus?
• Can a hot shower or bath irritate the sores?
• Can you catch chickenpox more than once?
• Who should not receive the chickenpox vaccine?
• What should I do if I think my child has been exposed to chickenpox?","U.S. National Library of Medicine, Chickenpox

73,Chlamydia: Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/chlamydia/,"Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and it often shows no symptoms. Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that can occur in any person. That’s why understanding chlamydia symptoms and treatment is so important. Left untreated, chlamydia can lead to serious health problems—but with early testing and proper care, it’s easy to treat and manage. Knowing how chlamydia spreads and what signs to watch for can help protect your health and your partner’s.","Chlamydia often doesn’t produce symptoms, especially early on. Most people don’t know they have it. Symptoms may appear 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the bacterial infection. These can include:

• Pain or burning during urination
• Lower abdominal pain
• Painful sexual intercourse
• Genital discharge
• Irregular periods
• Testicular pain
• Rectal pain, discharge, or bleeding
• Reactive arthritis (pain and inflammation of the joints that develop from an infection)

At its worst, chlamydia can affect fertility, making it difficult to get pregnant. It can sometimes cause an ectopic pregnancy (fertilization that develops outside the womb). Ectopic pregnancies are serious and can be life-threatening.","Chlamydia is caused by engaging in unprotected sexual activity (vaginal, anal, and oral) with a person who has the infection. It also can spread by touching an infected person’s genitals.","Your doctor can easily diagnose chlamydia. They may order a urine test. This involves peeing in a cup provided by the doctor’s office. The urine sample is sent to a lab to be tested. Your doctor may want to take a sample of bacteria. This involves taking a sample from your genitals with a swab to test.

If you are pregnant, your doctor will check for chlamydia even if you have no signs of the disease. This infection can be extremely dangerous to a newborn.

Women ages 25 and younger who are sexually active should be screened for STIs by their doctor on a regular basis. Women also should avoid douching (a form of vaginal hygiene). It reduces the “good” bacteria in the vagina and increases the risk of infection.

If you have chlamydia, you should tell anyone you have sexual contact with. If your partner has chlamydia or another STI, you should be tested right away.","You can reduce your risk of chlamydia by always using protection properly during sexual activity. Using it incorrectly can lessen this protection. Limit your number of sexual partners. Know the people with whom you have sexual contact, since the disease can also spread by touching your partner’s genitals. If you use spermicide for birth control, be aware that they contain nonoxynol-9 which can cause genital irritation. This can increase your risk of STIs.","Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotic medicine. Your doctor will prescribe either a single-dose pill or a several-day course of the same pill taken by mouth. Your partner also needs to be tested and treated. Tell your doctor if you are allergic to any type of antibiotic. Finish taking your entire antibiotic. Do not engage in sexual contact again until 7 days after you finish the medicine. Tell your doctor if you get a fever or stomach pain while taking the medicine. Also, tell your doctor if you are or might be pregnant.","If left untreated, chlamydia can spread to different parts of your body. This can cause additional harm. For example, if it spreads to your eyes, it can cause eye infections and blindness. If chlamydia spreads to the testicles and prostate, it can cause swelling, painful urination, fever, and lower back pain. The infection can also spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes (part of the female reproductive system). This can cause scarring in the area, as well as infertility or difficulty becoming pregnant. It may cause an ectopic pregnancy. If chlamydia is passed on to a newborn baby through a vaginal delivery, it can cause pneumonia, an eye infection, and even blindness in the baby.","• How long does chlamydia last?
• Can chlamydia come back once it’s been treated?
• Can antibiotics repair any damage from chlamydia?
• Is there any type of preventive medicine that can be taken before exposure to the disease?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: About Chlamydia

74,Chronic Bronchitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/chronic-bronchitis/,"Bronchitis is an inflammation (or irritation) of the airways in the lungs. Chronic means it lasts longer than 3 months. Airways are the tubes in your lungs that air passes through. They are also called bronchial tubes. When the airways are irritated, thick mucus forms in them. The mucus plugs up the airways and makes it hard for air to get into your lungs. That makes it hard to breathe.

Bronchitis also causes a cough that produces mucus (sometimes called sputum) and a feeling of tightness in your chest.

Chronic bronchitis is one type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and often occurs with emphysema.

When I see patients with chest colds, they usually don’t need antibiotics. Instead, I tell them about some simple treatments they can do at home. Read More","The main symptom of chronic bronchitis is a persistent cough that doesn’t go away for months. The cough nearly always produces mucus. The cough is also associated with wheezing (while breathing) and shortness of breath.

What causes chronic bronchitis?

Cigarette smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. When tobacco smoke is inhaled into the lungs, it irritates the airways, and they produce mucus. People who have been exposed for a long time to other things that irritate their lungs – such as chemical fumes, dust, and other substances – can also develop chronic bronchitis.","Cigarette smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. When tobacco smoke is inhaled into the lungs, it irritates the airways, and they produce mucus. People who have been exposed for a long time to other things that irritate their lungs, such as chemical fumes, dust, and other substances, can also develop chronic bronchitis.","Your doctor can diagnose chronic bronchitis. He or she will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as:

• Are you coughing up mucus?
• Are you having trouble breathing?
• Does your chest feel tight?
• How long have you had these symptoms?
• Do you smoke cigarettes?
• How many cigarettes do you smoke each day?
• How many years have you been smoking?
• Have you been breathing in other things that can irritate your lungs?

If your doctor thinks you have chronic bronchitis, you may be tested to find out if your lungs are damaged. You might have a pulmonary function test to see how well your lungs are working. During this test, you breathe into a machine that measures the amount of air in your lungs. Your doctor may also order blood tests and a chest X-ray or chest CT scan.","If you smoke, the most important thing you can do is to stop. The more smoke you breathe in, the more it damages your lungs. If you stop smoking, you’ll breathe better, you won’t cough as much, and your lungs will begin to heal. You’ll also reduce your chance of getting lung cancer. Ask your doctor to help you stop smoking.

Try to avoid other things that can irritate your lungs, such as aerosol products like hairspray, spray deodorant, and spray paint. Also avoid breathing in dust or chemical fumes. To protect your lungs, wear a mask over your nose and mouth if you are using paint, paint remover, varnish, or anything else with strong fumes.","Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called a bronchodilator to treat your chronic bronchitis. This medicine dilates (or opens) the airways in your lungs and helps you breathe better.

This medicine is usually inhaled (breathed in) rather than taken as a pill. An inhaler is the device used to get the medicine into your lungs. It’s important to use your inhaler the right way, so you get the most from the medicine. Your doctor will show you how to use your inhaler.

If you have severe shortness of breath, your doctor may also prescribe other medicines (such as medicines that help thin mucous) for you to take in pill form.

If your symptoms don’t get better with these medicines, your doctor may prescribe steroids. You can take steroids either as an inhaler or in pill form.

Will antibiotics help chronic bronchitis?

In general, antibiotics can’t help chronic bronchitis. You may need antibiotics if you get a lung infection along with your chronic bronchitis. If you have a lung infection, you may cough up more mucus. This mucus may be yellow or dark green. You also may have a fever, and your shortness of breath may get worse.

Because of the damage from chronic bronchitis, your lungs may not be able to get enough oxygen into your body. Your doctor may prescribe oxygen if your chronic bronchitis is severe, and medicine doesn’t help you feel better. If your doctor prescribes oxygen for you, be sure to use it day and night to get the most benefit. Oxygen can help you breathe better and live longer.","Exercising regularly can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe. Try to exercise at least 3 times a week. Start by exercising slowly and for just a little while. Then slowly increase the time you exercise each day and how fast you exercise. For example, you might begin by walking slowly for 15 minutes 3 times a week. Then, as you get in better shape, you can increase your walking speed. You can also increase the length of time you walk to 20 minutes, then 25 minutes, then 30 minutes. Ask your doctor for help creating an exercise plan that’s right for you.

An exercise program called pulmonary rehabilitation may help you improve your breathing. Pulmonary rehabilitation is often given by a respiratory therapist (a health care worker who knows about lung treatments). Your doctor may refer you to the pulmonary rehabilitation program at your local hospital.

A breathing method called “pursed-lip breathing” may also help you. To do this, you take a deep breath and then breathe out slowly through your mouth while you hold your lips as if you’re going to kiss someone. Pursed-lip breathing slows down the fast breathing that often comes with chronic bronchitis. It may help you feel better.

Chronic bronchitis increases your risk of lung infections, so be sure to get a flu shot every year. Also, get a pneumococcal vaccination as directed by your doctor to help protect against pneumonia. A COVID-19 vaccine is also important.","• How do I know what’s causing my chronic bronchitis?

75,Chronic Cough,https://familydoctor.org/condition/chronic-cough/,"Coughing is necessary to clear your throat and airways. A chronic cough lasts for 8 weeks or more. It’s commonly caused by allergies, acid reflux (heartburn), some health conditions, infections, or medicine. It usually goes away after the underlying condition is treated.","Coughing is a symptom of an underlying health condition. An occasional cough is common. However, see your doctor if your cough won’t go away and includes any of the following:

• Coughing up thick mucus
• Wheezing (making a whistling sound while breathing)
• A temperature (fever) higher than 101°F
• Losing weight without trying
• Night sweats (significant sweating while you sleep)
• Coughing up blood
• Swollen face and hives (an allergic skin reaction)
• Difficulty breathing
• Chest pain","Several lifestyle and health conditions can cause chronic cough, including:

• Smoking
• Common allergies (hay fever, mold, pets)
• Postnasal drip (the mucus that drains down the back of your throat from the back of your nose)
• Certain medicines (blood pressure medicines called ACE inhibitors can cause a persistent cough.)
• Air pollution
• Asthma (a lung disease)
• GERD/acid reflux /heartburn (when acid from your stomach backs up into your throat)
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD is a lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe)
• An upper respiratory infection such as bronchitis or sinusitis (some respiratory infections commonly affect children)
• Viral and post-viral infections (the cough can last for weeks after the infection has cleared)
• Lung cancer

Sometimes, a chronic cough occurs because of aspiration (inhaling food or drink).","Your doctor will examine you. This includes taking your temperature, looking at the back of your throat, and inside your ears. They will place a stethoscope on your back and chest. This is to listen to you breathe. They will ask you about your symptoms and health history. Your doctor may ask you if you know what triggers your cough. Your doctor also may check your oxygen level by placing a small clip on your index finger. This device measures how much oxygen you are getting. A reading of 100 is ideal. A reading of less than 90 is a concern. You may be given oxygen by placing a mask over your nose. The mask is connected to the oxygen canister with a tube.

Additional tests may include lab tests, such as a blood sample (to check for infection), throat swab, and mucus sample. Your doctor may order a chest X-ray or a CT (computed tomography) scan to look at your lungs. They may have you do a spirometry test. This involves breathing into a tube that is connected to a computer. The computer evaluates your breathing. Another breathing test is the methacholine challenge test if your doctor believes you may have asthma. For this test, you breathe in a mist of a substance called methacholine. Methacholine causes your lungs to open and close. After breathing in the methacholine, you will do a spirometry test.","You can prevent or avoid a chronic cough if the underlying cause of your cough is treatable. If your cough is due to allergies, your doctor can treat your allergies with medicine. If it is caused by smoking, you should quit smoking. If your cough is triggered by food, avoid those foods. If your doctor believes your chronic cough is due to other health conditions or medicines you take, they can evaluate alternative options.","Treatment depends on the cause of your chronic cough.

• Smoking: Stop smoking. See your doctor for suggestions if you have difficulty stopping.
• Allergies: If you have postnasal drip from allergies, avoid the things that bother your nose and throat. That might be dust, smoke, the outdoors, pets, cleaning products and deodorizers, and chemical fumes. Some over-the-counter medicines can help your allergy symptoms. If that doesn’t help, ask your doctor for prescription medicine.
• Acid reflux (heartburn): If you have acid reflux, try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches. Avoid overeating and consuming things that trigger your cough. Don’t eat or drink for a few hours before you lie down. Ask your doctor about over-the-counter or prescription medicines that can help relieve the acid in your stomach. This reduces acid reflux.
• Medicine: If you are taking a medicine that causes you to cough, your doctor might be able to prescribe another medicine for you. Don’t stop taking the medicine without consulting your doctor.
• Asthma: If you have asthma, your doctor will help you decide on the right treatment for your symptoms.","Living with a chronic cough is uncomfortable. It leaves you feeling exhausted (from coughing day and night). It causes chest pain, headache, urinary incontinence (when you unexpectedly urinate a little), and even broken ribs. It’s possible to live without a cough or reduce it by treating the underlying cause. See your doctor instead of suffering unnecessarily.","• Do cough drops, hot drinks, or water help ease a chronic cough?

76,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disease that causes you to become so fatigued (tired) you can’t perform normal daily tasks. The main symptom of CFS is chronic fatigue that lasts more than 6 months. Physical or mental activities often make the,"symptoms worse. Rest usually doesn’t improve the symptoms.

People who have CFS may experience the following symptoms:

• Fatigue.
• Headaches.
• Sore throat.
• Tender or painful areas in your neck or armpits due to swollen lymph nodes (or lymph glands).
• Muscle soreness.
• Pain that moves from joint to joint without swelling or redness.
• Loss of memory or concentration.
• Trouble sleeping.
• Extreme tiredness after exercising that lasts more than 24 hours.

These and other symptoms often won’t go away or keep coming back for 6 months or more.

CFS may occur after an illness (such as a cold). Or it can start during or shortly after a period of high stress. It can also come on slowly without any clear starting point or any obvious cause. In some cases, CFS can last for years.",No one is certain about what causes CFS. The symptoms may be caused by a weak immune system. Or they may be caused by some kind of virus. Researchers are still looking for the cause of CFS.,"CFS is difficult to diagnose. Some people have a hard time accepting CFS as a disease. It’s important to remember that your fatigue is real and that you can work with your doctor to improve your symptoms.

The first step is to see if there is any other explainable cause for your fatigue. Your doctor will probably want to review your symptoms and medical history and give you a physical exam. Your doctor may also want to do some blood tests, but lab testing is not often helpful in the diagnosis of CFS.","CFS as a disease cannot be prevented. However, you can manage the symptoms of CFS.","Medicine can treat some of the symptoms, such as muscle aches, sleep problems, anxiety, and depression. The medicine may only reduce your symptoms and allow you to be more active, not cure the fatigue. So far, there is no medicine that cures the entire syndrome. Most symptoms improve with time.

Your doctor can work with you to provide relief from your CFS symptoms. He or she also can help you find ways of coping with the way CFS changes your life. Chronic fatigue affects you physically, emotionally, and socially. When you address all of these factors, you have the best chance of adjusting to your illness and feeling more satisfied with your life.

If you have CFS, having a good long-term relationship with your doctor helps. Communicating with your doctor will help him or her manage your CFS symptoms.","There are strategies for dealing with the daily challenges of CFS. These may work for you, especially in combination with medications prescribed by your doctor.

• Keep a daily diary to identify times when you have the most energy. Plan your activities for these times.
• Keep up some level of activity and exercise, within your abilities. Your doctor can help you plan an exercise program to maintain your strength at whatever level is possible. Exercise can help your body and mind.
• Give yourself permission to recognize and express your feelings, such as sadness, anger, and frustration.
• Ask for support from family and friends. Look for support groups or counseling in your community. Your doctor is another important source of help. Emotional support is important in coping with a chronic health problem.
• If your memory and concentration are affected by chronic fatigue, keep lists and make notes to remind yourself of important things. Also, give yourself more time for activities that take concentration. Medicine may also help you sleep better, which might improve your memory and concentration.","• I’m always tired. Is there something wrong with me?
• Do I need any tests to help determine why I’m so tired all the time?
• What is the likely cause of my fatigue?
• Will alternative therapies such as yoga or acupuncture help?
• Do I need to make any diet or lifestyle changes?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? What kind of exercise should I do?
• How do I convince people that my fatigue is real?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

77,Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/chronic-kidney-disease-ckd/,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs from progressive damage to your kidneys. The damage occurs slowly, over time. Normal, healthy kidneys remove waste and extra water from the blood. Then, your body removes the waste in your urine. Kidneys help to control your blood pressure and make hormones. If you have CKD, your kidneys cannot remove waste from the blood as well as they should. Almost 20 million people in the United States have this disease.","Most people who have CKD do not have symptoms early on. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include:

• Fatigue
• Weakness
• Loss of appetite
• Trouble sleeping
• Trouble thinking clearly
• Swelling of feet and ankles","The most common causes of CKD are high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Infections and urinary blockages can cause CKD as well.

CKD may be genetic (run in families). You may be at risk of CKD if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. Talk to your doctor about your risk factors. It is important to diagnose CKD early.","Your doctor can review your symptoms and do an exam. There are 3 tests they may do if they suspect CKD:

• Blood pressure test: Checks for high blood pressure.
• Urine albumin: Checks to see how much protein is in your urine.
• Serum creatinine: Checks to see how much waste is in your blood.

Routine screening for chronic kidney disease isn’t generally recommended for adults who don’t have symptoms. However, if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other risk factors, talk to your doctor about whether CKD testing is right for you. Early testing and treatment can help prevent serious kidney problems down the road.","If you are at risk of CKD, there are things you can do to prevent it:

• Lower your blood pressure. Medicines called ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers can help. They also can keep kidney damage from getting worse.
• Manage your blood sugar level if you have diabetes. This often includes taking medicine and making changes to diet and exercise.
• Quit smoking. Smoking damages your kidneys and raises blood pressure. It can interfere with blood pressure medicines.
• Eat healthy and exercise.
• Lose weight.
• Reduce your alcohol consumption.
• Drink lots of water and make sure you stay hydrated.
• Reduce your salt intake.","Treatment for CKD depends on the cause of your condition. CKD can cause other problems. Talk with your doctor about how to treat these. They may have you take medicine for:

• High triglycerides and cholesterol. Triglycerides are a type of fat. These levels often are higher in people who have CKD.
• Anemia. Anemia occurs when your blood doesn’t have enough hemoglobin. This is a protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Symptoms of anemia include feeling tired and weak.
• Weak bones. CKD can change the way your body uses minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus. This can cause your bones to weaken.

People who have CKD may lose their appetite. A nutritionist can help you plan a diet that will keep you strong. Talk to your doctor about CKD and nutrition. He or she may want you to eat less protein. Too much protein can make your kidneys work too hard. Proper hydration is important, too. Make sure you are drinking enough water.","Even with the right treatments, CKD can get worse over time. You need to have regular checkups so your doctor can check your kidney function.

If your kidneys stop working, you have kidney failure. This can cause waste to build up in your body and poison your blood. It can cause vomiting, weakness, confusion, and coma. Kidney failure is treated with dialysis. A special machine filters your blood to remove the waste build-up. Dialysis may be done in a clinic or hospital setting. Some dialysis machines are small enough to strap to your body and use at home.

People with CKD should also avoid taking NSAIDs (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory medications).","• What is the cause of my CKD?

78,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/,"COPD is a disease that makes it hard for you to breathe. The two main types of COPD are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis happens when there is an increase of swelling and mucus in your airways. (The airways are the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs.) This swelling causes your airways to narrow, making it harder to push air through them. Emphysema happens when the walls of the air sacs inside your lungs are damaged. This traps air inside your lungs. It can make you feel short of breath.

COPD develops slowly and gets worse over time. When COPD is severe, it can interfere with basic tasks. These include doing light housework, walking, or even washing and dressing.","COPD can cause a variety of symptoms, including:

• A long-lasting cough
• A cough that produces mucus
• Shortness of breath, especially during physical activity
• A tight feeling in the chest
• Not being able to take a deep breath

COPD symptoms start slowly. They get worse over a period of years if not diagnosed and treated early. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to complications. These could include heart problems (irregular heartbeat and heart failure), high blood pressure, and respiratory infections. Infections can further damage your lungs.","COPD is caused by damage to the lungs. Damage occurs from breathing in unhealthy substances over time. This includes:

• Air pollution
• Chemical fumes
• Gases
• Vapors
• Mists
• Tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke)

The majority of COPD cases are caused by smoking.

You are at higher risk of developing COPD if you smoke or are around secondhand smoke. Your risk also increases if you have long-term exposure to things that irritate your lungs. This could include certain chemicals, air pollution, or dust. Some people have a genetic condition that can cause COPD, even if they have never been exposed to lung irritants.","The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) does not recommend general screening for COPD. If you are showing symptoms of COPD, your doctor will perform an exam. They will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. They will place a stethoscope on your chest and back to listen to you breathe.

An important test to diagnose COPD is called a spirometry test. This simple, non-invasive test measures the amount of air you can blow out of your lungs. It involves breathing into a tube that is connected to a computer. The computer may have a graphic (such as candles or a brick wall) to help you with the test. You are asked to take a deep breath and blow into the tube to blow out as many candles (or knock down as many bricks) as you can. You may be asked to repeat the test multiple times in order to get a good reading.

The spirometry test will tell your doctor if you have COPD and how severe it is. It can also be used to determine if something else is causing your symptoms, such as asthma or heart failure. Your spirometry reading will help your doctor decide on the best treatment for you.","In most cases, COPD is an avoidable disease. The best way to prevent COPD is to not smoke. You should also limit your exposure to things that can irritate your lungs over time. This includes secondhand smoke, air pollution (avoid being outside on days when air pollution is high), chemicals, and dust.","If you are at risk for COPD, an early diagnosis is key. According to the AAFP, death from COPD is preventable with early diagnosis and treatment. Treatment includes:

Lifestyle changes: Stop smoking if you smoke cigarettes, cigars, or e-cigarettes. Don’t smoke anything. Talk to your family doctor about quitting. They can provide great resources for helping you quit.

Medicines: Your doctor may prescribe one or more medicines to ease your symptoms and help you breathe. These medicines may include:

• Oral antibiotics – to treat infections
• Bronchodilators – inhaled medicine to relax the muscles around your airway
• Oral or inhaled steroids – to control the inflammation in your lungs and help you breathe
• Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics) – inhaled medicine to relax the muscles around your airway

Several of these medicines can be combined into a single inhaler.

Inhaled medicines involve a small, handheld canister that you carry with you. You can use the medicine as needed or as your doctor has advised. Ask your doctor if you should use a spacer. This is a small, hollow device that helps you inhale more of the medication into your lungs where it is needed.

Some inhaled medicine is given through a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a machine that turns liquid medicine into a vapor that you breathe in. It is commonly used to treat people who have more serious COPD. It also helps people who have trouble using handheld inhalers.

Vaccines: Certain vaccines can prevent dangerous respiratory infections, such as the flu, pneumonia, RSV, and COVID-19. These infections can cause serious problems for people with COPD.

Oxygen therapy: You may have to use oxygen on a regular basis to help you breathe. This involves wearing a mask or nasal prongs and having the oxygen tank with you to use as you need or as your doctor has advised.

Pulmonary rehabilitation: This is a combination of therapies to help you manage your disease and improve your quality of life. A team of health professionals will help you create a plan to help you feel better. Your plan may include a diet and exercise program, breathing strategies, and ways to conserve energy.

Surgery: This is rare. This could involve a lung reduction operation or a lung transplant. This is usually a treatment of last resort.",null,"• How can I tell if my symptoms are caused by COPD or another illness?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","COPD is a lifelong condition. But there are things you can do to manage your symptoms.

One thing you should do is work with your doctor to develop a COPD Action Plan. A COPD Action Plan can help you recognize when your symptoms change. It also tells you what actions to take when they do. It is important to follow your plan every day, so make it part of your daily routine.

You play an active role in managing COPD symptoms through lifestyle changes. Managing symptoms can also slow the progression of the disease. If you have COPD, you should:

• Avoid things that irritate your lungs. If you smoke, quit. Also avoid air pollution, chemical fumes, dust, and secondhand smoke.
• Get ongoing medical care. It is important that you see your doctor regularly. Take the medicines that they prescribe. Call your doctor or make an appointment if you have any questions, new symptoms, or worsening symptoms.
• Manage your disease. Make lifestyle changes to minimize the effects of your symptoms. Do activities slowly. Find simple ways to do daily activities, such as cooking or cleaning. Wear clothes and shoes that are easy to take on and off. Ask for help instead of trying to do everything yourself.
• Prepare for emergencies. Talk to your doctor about what symptoms signal an emergency. That way, you’ll know when to call the doctor or go the emergency room. Keep phone numbers on hand for your doctor, the hospital, and someone who can help you get medical care. Call your doctor if your symptoms are getting worse, if you have signs of an infection such as fever, or if you’re having trouble breathing.
• Get emotional support. Living with COPD can be hard. You may feel anxious, depressed, afraid, or stressed. It can help to talk to someone about your feelings. You may talk to a counselor or join a support group. Family and friends can also help. Don’t be afraid to tell others how you feel.

Remember that early diagnosis can lead to proper treatment, which can help you feel better. The longer you let your COPD go untreated, the worse you will feel. Serious COPD will make it difficult to be physically active. This will affect even the simplest of activities, such as dressing or shopping.

COPD symptoms may make you feel fatigued (overly tired). Having difficulty breathing also interferes with eating. Your doctor may discuss a plan for diet, nutrition, and supplements."
79,Chronic Pain,https://familydoctor.org/condition/chronic-pain/,"There are 2 types of pain: acute and chronic. Acute pain lets you know that your body is injured. It usually doesn’t last long. It should go away as your body heals. Chronic pain lasts much longer. Chronic pain may last months or even years. Chronic pain may interfere with your daily activities. And because the pain lasts so long, people who have chronic pain may also have low self-esteem, depression, and anger. Sometimes these emotions make the pain even worse.","Chronic pain can occur anywhere in the body. People with chronic pain may have these types of pain:

• Headaches
• Back pain
• Cancer pain
• Arthritis pain
• Pain resulting from nerve damage

• A dull ache
• Soreness
• Stiffness
• Stinging
• Squeezing
• Throbbing
• Burning
• Shooting

Sometimes people with chronic pain have other symptoms. These could include feeling tired, having trouble sleeping, or mood changes.","Sometimes, chronic pain is caused by an old injury or infection, or by a disease. Sometimes there is no known cause for the pain.

Conditions that may trigger or cause chronic pain include:

• Infections
• Headaches or migraines
• Back problems
• Cancer
• Arthritis
• Fibromyalgia
• Nerve damage
• Previous surgery

Depression and stress tend to make pain worse, including chronic pain.","Your doctor will ask you about your medical history. Describing your pain will help your doctor find the right treatment for you. Tell them where the pain is, how bad it is, and how often it occurs. Also talk about what makes the pain better or worse. Your doctor will do a physical exam and may run tests to help determine the cause of your pain.

They will also review other health problems you may have (such as breathing problems or heart conditions). These could keep you from doing some types of therapy. Your doctor may also ask if you have had any problems with sleep, mood, or anxiety.","In many cases, chronic pain can’t be prevented. Some conditions that cause it, such as cancer, can be avoided in various ways. But there is often nothing you can do to control if you get chronic pain.","The goal of treatment for chronic pain is to reduce pain and to improve your ability to function. There are many treatments available. They will usually not take away all of your pain. But they can reduce how much pain you have and how often it occurs. Some of the more common treatments include:

Several types of therapy can help ease your pain:

• Physical therapy– includes stretching and activities to strengthen muscle.
• Low-impact exercise– could include walking, swimming, or biking.
• Occupational therapy– teaches you how to pace yourself and do ordinary tasks differently. This helps you reduce your pain or avoid reinjuring yourself.
• Behavioral therapy– methods that help you relax and decrease stress. They could include meditation, tai chi, or yoga.

Almost anything you do to relax or get your mind off your problems may help control pain. Even if you are taking medicine for pain, you should include relaxing activities in your daily life. Relaxation can actually change the body’s chemicals that produce pain. You might have to use stress-reduction methods for several weeks before you notice a decrease in pain. Your doctor can give you tips about stress reduction and relaxation methods.","Lifestyle changes are an important part of treatment for chronic pain. Getting regular sleep at night and not taking daytime naps should help. Stopping smoking also helps because the nicotine in cigarettes can make some medicines less effective and impairs healing. Smokers also tend to have more pain than nonsmokers.

Living with chronic pain can be very difficult. It is important to take care of yourself. Get plenty of sleep, eat a healthy diet, and try to exercise moderately. Do the best you can to manage stress and depression. These can make your pain worse.

Learn about what is causing your pain. Understand your limits and work within them so you don’t cause yourself more pain. Be open to trying new ways of managing your pain.","• What is the likely cause of my pain?
• Why won’t it go away?
• What is the best treatment option for me? Will I need medicine?
• Will I become addicted to opioid pain relievers?
• Will physical, occupational or behavioral therapy help relieve my pain?
• What about alternative therapies, such as yoga, massage or acupuncture?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? What kind of exercise should I do?
• Do I need to make any lifestyle changes?","National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health: Chronic Pain: In Depth

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Medicines used for chronic pain include pain relievers, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. Different types of medicines help people who have different types of pain. If your doctor recommends an over-the-counter pain reliever, read and follow the instructions on the box. Short-acting medicines treat pain that comes and goes. Your doctor usually will recommend long-acting medicines for constant pain.

Your doctor might recommend a prescription pain reliever. Be sure to follow their instructions for how to take the medicine. Many prescription pain relievers are opioids. Opioids can be effective when taken as directed. But many people who misuse opioids become addicted. Opioid addiction is a very serious health issue that can lead to death.

Some people with chronic pain find benefits in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). These involve treatments that are not part of mainstream medical care. Acupuncture and massage are examples of these treatments. Talk to your doctor before trying any CAM procedures.

Severe cases of chronic pain could require more invasive treatment. This could include electrical stimulation, nerve blocks, or surgery. There is usually no cure for chronic pain. Talk to your doctor to learn how to best control your pain."
80,Chronic Pelvic Pain,https://familydoctor.org/condition/chronic-pelvic-pain/,"Chronic pelvic pain is pain in your pelvic region (the area below your belly button and above your hips). It’s considered chronic if it lasts for at least 6 months. The pain may be steady, or it may come and go. It can feel like a dull ache, or it can be sharp. The pain may be mild, or it may be bad enough to interfere with normal daily activities.",The primary symptom of chronic pelvic pain is the pain itself. How often you feel the pain and the severity differs. It depends on the person and what is causing the pain. A woman may feel it during sex. Another person may feel it only after eating. It may come and go or be present every day.,Some of the more common causes of chronic pelvic pain include:,"Your doctor will ask you questions about your past and present health. He or she will ask about illness or health-related problems in your family. You may be asked to describe the kind of pain you have, where it is, and how strong it is. Tell your doctor anything you can about what causes the pain to get better or worse. He or she may ask:

• Is the pain related to your menstrual cycle?
• Is it related to bowel movements?
• Does it hurt during urination or sexual activity?
• Have you had an infection?
• Have you had surgery in your pelvic area?
• Your doctor may also want to perform some tests to help make the diagnosis.

What types of tests may be performed?

Several tests can help your doctor find the cause of your pain. Your history and physical exam will help him or her decide which, if any, tests to do. These may include blood tests, urologic tests, ultrasound, or X-rays. In some cases, your doctor may need to perform minor surgery, such as laparoscopy. Laparoscopy is a procedure in which the doctor inserts a thin, lighted tube in your abdomen to look at your pelvic organs.","Whether your chronic pelvic pain can be prevented or avoided depends on what is causing the pain. There are many different causes. Some of them can be prevented. Others cannot be prevented.

Early diagnosis can sometimes prevent chronic pelvic pain. It is important to talk to your doctor when you begin to feel pelvic pain.","Treatment depends on your individual problem. Your doctor will help you determine which form of treatment is right for you. Some treatment options include:

• Stopping ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovary). This can be done with birth control pills or injections.
• Using nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory pain relievers. This includes ibuprofen (one brand name: Motrin) or naproxen (brand name: Aleve).
• Relaxation exercises, biofeedback (treatment to control emotional states using electronic devices), and physical therapy.
• Changing posture.
• Regular physical activity.
• Antibiotics
• Counseling

Rarely, surgery is necessary if doctors can see pelvic abnormalities.","Chronic pain is never easy to live with. If traditional methods of pain relief don’t work, there are alternatives. Your doctor can help you find a way to manage your pain. Sometimes, chronic pain responds to a nerve block that can block the pain for an extended period of time. Sometimes physical therapy or weight loss can help. Just know that things aren’t hopeless. Keep exploring pain management options until you find the one that works for you. You never want to take opioids for chronic pain.","• What is the likely cause of my pelvic pain?
• Do I need any tests, such as ultrasound or X-rays?
• What do my test results mean?
• Based on the cause of my pain, what are my treatment options?

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","• Endometriosis: When tissue that normally grows inside the uterus grows in other parts of the body, it’s called endometriosis. It can grow on your ovaries, in your pelvis, on your bladder, or in other areas. When you have your period, this tissue swells and bleeds, just like the lining of your uterus. This is often painful. Scar tissue can form in your pelvic area.
• Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection in the female reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries). Normally, the cervix (opening to the womb) prevents bacteria in the vagina from spreading to these organs. If the cervix is exposed to a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, it becomes infected. This allows bacteria to travel to the internal organs. This can make organs inflamed and infected. When this happens, the woman’s fallopian tubes may be damaged. It causes pain and makes it difficult to become pregnant.
• Fibroids: Fibroids are benign (not cancerous) growths in the muscular wall of the uterus. These growths can be very tiny or as large as a cantaloupe. They are often painful.
• Ovarian remnant: During a complete hysterectomy, the uterus and ovaries are removed. Sometimes a small piece of the ovary gets left behind, and painful cysts can develop.

• Irritable bowel syndrome: IBS is a painful problem with the intestines. With IBS, the intestines squeeze too hard or not hard enough. This causes food to move too quickly or too slowly through the intestines.
• Interstitial cystitis: Interstitial cystitis is a chronic bladder problem. People with interstitial cystitis have a bladder wall that is inflamed and irritated (red and sore). This inflammation can scar the bladder or make it stiff. A stiff bladder can’t expand as urine fills it. In some cases, the walls of the bladder may bleed slightly. A few people get sores in the bladder lining.
• Past or present sexual abuse: If you have been the victim of sexual abuse, you are more likely to experience chronic pelvic pain."
199,High Cholesterol,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cholesterol/,"Cholesterol is a waxy substance your liver makes to protect nerves and to make cell tissue and certain hormones. Your body also gets cholesterol from the food you eat. This includes eggs, meats, and dairy. There is “good” (HDL) cholesterol and “bad” (LDL) cholesterol. Too much bad cholesterol (LDL) can be bad for your health.

Good cholesterol is known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). It removes cholesterol from the bloodstream. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the “bad” cholesterol.

If your total cholesterol level is high because of a high LDL level, you may be at higher risk of heart disease or stroke. But, if your total cholesterol level is high only because of a high HDL level, you’re probably not at higher risk.

Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. When you eat more calories than your body can use, it turns the extra calories into triglycerides.

Changing your lifestyle (diet and exercise) can improve your cholesterol levels, lower LDL and triglycerides, and raise HDL.

Your ideal cholesterol level will depend on your risk for heart disease.

• Total cholesterol level – less than 200 is best, but it depends on your HDL and LDL levels.
• LDL cholesterol levels – less than 130 is best, but this depends on your risk for heart disease.
• HDL cholesterol levels – 60 or higher reduces your risk for heart disease.
• Triglycerides – less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) is best.","Often, there are no specific symptoms of high cholesterol. You could have high cholesterol and not know it.

If you have high cholesterol, your body may store the extra cholesterol in your arteries. These are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body. A buildup of cholesterol in your arteries is known as plaque. Over time, plaque can become hard and make your arteries narrow. Large deposits of plaque can completely block an artery. Cholesterol plaques can also break apart, leading to formation of a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood.

A blocked artery to the heart can cause a heart attack. A blocked artery to your brain can cause a stroke.

Many people don’t discover that they have high cholesterol until they suffer one of these life-threatening events. Some people find out through routine check-ups that include blood tests.","Your liver produces cholesterol, but you also get cholesterol from food. Eating too many foods that are high in fat can increase your cholesterol level.

Being overweight and inactive also causes high cholesterol. If you are overweight, you most likely have a higher level of triglycerides. If you never exercise and aren’t active in general, it can lower your HDL (good cholesterol).

Your family history also affects your cholesterol level. Research has shown that high cholesterol tends to run in families. If you have an immediate family member who has it, you could have it, too.

Smoking also causes high cholesterol. It lowers your HDL (good cholesterol).","You can’t tell if you have high cholesterol without having it checked. A simple blood test will reveal your cholesterol level.

Men 35 years of age and older and women 45 years of age and older should have their cholesterol checked. Men and women 20 years of age and older who have risk factors for heart disease should have their cholesterol checked. Teens may need to be checked if they are taking certain medicines or have a strong family history of high cholesterol. Ask your doctor how often you should have your cholesterol checked.

Risk factors for heart disease include:

• Cigarette smoking
• High blood pressure
• Older age
• Having an immediate family member (parent or sibling) who has had heart disease
• Being overweight or having obesity
• Inactivity","Making healthy food choices and exercising are two ways to reduce your risk of developing high cholesterol.

Eat fewer foods with saturated fats (such as red meat and most dairy products). Choose healthier fats. This includes lean meats, avocados, nuts, and low-fat dairy items. Avoid foods that contain trans fat (such as fried and packaged foods). Look for foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These foods include salmon, herring, walnuts, and almonds. Some egg brands contain omega-3.

Exercise can be simple. Go for a walk. Take a yoga class. Ride your bike to work. You could even participate in a team sport. Aim to get 30 minutes of activity every day.","If you have high cholesterol, you may need to make some lifestyle changes. If you smoke, quit. Exercise regularly. If you’re overweight, losing just five to 10 pounds can improve your cholesterol levels and your risk for heart disease. Make sure to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish.

Depending on your risk factors, your doctor may prescribe medicine and lifestyle changes.","If you have high cholesterol, you are twice as likely to develop heart disease. That is why it is important to have your cholesterol levels checked, especially if you have a family history of heart disease. Reducing your LDL “bad cholesterol” through good diet, exercise, and medicine can make a positive impact on your overall health.","• Am I at risk for heart disease?
• How often should I get my cholesterol tested?

81,Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cirrhosis-and-portal-hypertension/,"Cirrhosis is a form of liver disease. It occurs when cells in your liver become damaged and your body can’t repair them. As the liver cells die, scar tissue forms. A buildup of scar tissue prevents proper blood flow. A normal liver is able to filter wastes and toxins to get them out of your body. If scar tissue keeps blood from flowing through your liver, it can’t get filtered. This causes toxins and wastes to build up in your body.

Portal hypertension is a leading side effect of cirrhosis. Your body carries blood to your liver through a large blood vessel called the portal vein. Cirrhosis slows your blood flow and puts stress on the portal vein. This causes high blood pressure known as portal hypertension.","Cirrhosis is a condition that happens over time. You may not have any symptoms in the early stages. Contact your doctor if you begin to notice the following symptoms or signs:

• Loss of appetite
• Unplanned weight loss
• Weakness and fatigue
• Nausea
• Jaundice (yellowing of your skin and eyes)
• Dark brown urine
• Red palms
• Vomiting blood
• Menstrual problems (in women)
• Mental confusion, such as a hard time focusing or remembering
• Itchy skin
• Swelling or bloating in your abdomen, due to fluids collecting","There are three main causes of cirrhosis.

• Fatty liver disease. This occurs when too much fat builds up in your liver. People who are overweight or have obesity are more at risk for this disease. People with diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure also are at risk.
• Alcohol-related liver disease. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to cirrhosis. This includes long-term alcohol use and frequent binge drinking.
• Hepatitis B and C. These are viral infections you can contract.

Minor causes of cirrhosis include:

• Certain genetic diseases, such as Wilson disease or autoimmune hepatitis
• Continued exposure to toxic chemicals
• Infections caused by parasites
• Continued use of certain medicines
• Certain congenital heart defects or chronic heart failure","To diagnose cirrhosis, your doctor will begin with a physical exam. They also will review your symptoms, health history, and lifestyle. Tests are needed to check your liver and confirm diagnosis. These include blood and imaging tests. Blood tests can detect hepatitis, abnormal enzyme levels, or abnormal blood cells. Imaging tests take pictures of your liver. In some cases, your doctor may do a biopsy on your liver. This involves taking a sample of liver tissue to look at it in the lab.

If you have cirrhosis, your doctor will likely check for portal hypertension. They will check your abdomen for extra fluid (ascites). Your doctor will check for swelling or pressure in the blood vessels around your portal vein. They may perform other tests to diagnose portal hypertension. Your doctor also may do an endoscopy (using a lighted camera scope to look at your digestive system).","Some people can make lifestyle changes to help prevent cirrhosis. These include drinking safe amounts of alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and protecting yourself from hepatitis. If you’re overweight or have obesity, talk to your doctor about how to safely lose weight.","The goal for cirrhosis treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent further damage. Treatment also can avoid or manage complications caused by cirrhosis. With this condition, blood can’t flow normally through the portal vein. The blood has to return to your heart through other blood vessels. Most often it goes through blood vessels in your stomach, esophagus, or intestines. These vessels then swell due to the increased amount of blood flowing through them. This puts pressure on the vessels and can cause them to burst. Bleeding from a broken blood vessel is serious and can be fatal.

Your doctor may prescribe medicine to help prevent your blood vessels from bursting. These medicines have some side effects and may interact with other medicines. They’re not suitable for everyone. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to lower your blood pressure if you have portal hypertension. If you have hepatitis, your doctor will prescribe an antiviral medicine. You may need other medicines, depending on the cause of cirrhosis.

If medicine isn’t enough, you may need surgery. Surgery can decrease pressure by interrupting the blood flow in your blood vessels. The doctor or surgeon will insert a long tube through your mouth to your stomach. Then, they will place rubber bands or hardened chemicals in the swollen blood vessels to block them off. Another type of procedure, called TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), may be done in some cases.

People who have portal hypertension may need surgery to connect certain blood vessels. If a blood vessel bursts, you’ll need surgery to stop the bleeding and repair it.

If surgery doesn’t work or you have liver failure, you may need a liver transplant.","There is no cure for cirrhosis. However, work with your doctor on a treatment plan to manage symptoms and help prevent more damage.

• You shouldn’t drink any alcohol, as it continues to damage your liver.
• Talk with your doctor before taking any medicines. This includes antibiotics, birth control pills, and all over-the-counter medicines.
• Take care of yourself. Ask your doctor if you should follow a special diet. You may need to watch how much sugar and protein you eat. If you have swelling or are retaining fluid, avoid salt or sodium.

Your doctor may recommend screening for liver cancer. If left untreated, cirrhosis can get worse and be life threatening. It can cause a coma, liver failure, or death.","• Will I need to have surgery or a liver transplant?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to help manage cirrhosis?
• What type of exercise is good for me?
• Are there any medicines I should avoid taking?
• Can I drink any alcohol?
• If my symptoms get worse, when should I call the doctor?","American Liver Foundation: Cirrhosis

82,Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cleft-lip-cleft-palate/,"Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects. They happen when a baby’s lip or mouth don’t form correctly early in pregnancy. The word cleft means split or break. Cleft lip is an opening in the upper lip and nose. Cleft palate is an opening in the roof of the mouth (palate).

Babies can have a cleft lip, cleft palate, or both. A cleft may affect one side of the lip or palate, or both sides. About 1 or 2 in 1,000 babies are born with cleft lip or palate in the United States each year.","The major symptom is the presence of the cleft at birth. A cleft lip could be as small as a tiny notch in the upper lip. It could also be as large as a split or hole that goes up into the nose. A cleft palate could be just a small area that isn’t formed properly. But it also could be a large separation in the roof of the mouth.

Children who have clefts often have other health issues. They can have trouble eating and talking. They may also have hearing problems, problems with their ears, or problems with their teeth.","Cleft lip and cleft palate are defects that occur early in pregnancy. A baby’s facial features develop in the first trimester (3 months). The lips form first, followed by the mouth and palate. Clefts occur if the tissues and cells don’t form right. Cleft lip and cleft palate can occur by themselves. They also can be part of another condition or syndrome.

No one knows exactly what causes clefts. Doctors believe it’s due to factors from genetics or the environment. There are certain things that could increase your risk of having a baby with a cleft. These include:

• Having a family history of cleft lip or palate.
• Using tobacco, drugs, or alcohol during pregnancy.
• Not getting enough nutrients during pregnancy, such as folic acid.
• Having diabetes before pregnancy.
• Taking certain medicines, such as some for epilepsy, during pregnancy.
• Obesity during pregnancy.
• Having certain infections during pregnancy, such as rubella (German measles).",Cleft lip and cleft palate are usually diagnosed at birth during the baby’s first examination. Sometimes your doctor can see it on a routine ultrasound. This is an imaging test done throughout your pregnancy.,"The exact cause of these birth defects is unknown. So, you cannot prevent or avoid them. But there are steps you can take to lower your risk of having a baby with a birth defect. These include:

• Taking folic acid before and during pregnancy.
• Avoiding tobacco, drugs, and alcohol during pregnancy.
• Getting to a healthy weight before pregnancy and not gaining too much weight during pregnancy.
• Getting vaccinations and protecting yourself from infections.

Talk to your doctor about these and other ways to help reduce the chance of birth defects.","The treatment for cleft lip and cleft palate depends on a few key factors. These include the type of cleft and your baby’s overall health. Clefts can cause problems with a child’s development. So, treatment is recommended to start as early as possible.

Most babies who have a cleft lip, cleft palate, or both will need some type of surgery. Surgery to repair a cleft lip is usually done before the baby is 1 year old. A cleft palate is usually repaired before the baby is 18 months old. Some children will need more surgeries as they grow.

Clefts can create other health issues, such as speech and dental problems. You should work with your doctor to form a team of experts to treat your baby. The group will contain doctors and nurses from many related areas. It could include an oral surgeon, speech therapist, pediatric dentist, audiologist, and nutritionist, among many others. You also can search for special cleft teams and centers throughout the United States.","Over time, most children need added treatment to manage their related issues. This is another reason to have a cleft team that you know well and are happy with. Some follow-up problems include:

• Ear tubes, for hearing loss or fluid buildup.
• Dental care, for any teeth or mouth issues.
• Speech therapy, for language difficulties.
• General counseling, for emotional well being. Doctors also recommend counseling for parents and other family members. The condition affects everyone. It is important to talk with doctors on how to best manage it.

Adults who had cleft lip or cleft palate as a child may have some lasting effects. But with early treatment, most live normal and healthy lives. You do have a chance of passing the birth defect to your children. This is a low percentage though, as most cleft cases are random.","• Will my child always have issues related to their cleft lip or cleft palate?
• If I have cleft lip or cleft palate, what is the chance of my children having it?
• If one child has it, what is the chance of future children having it?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Cleft Lip and Palate

83,Club Drug Use,https://familydoctor.org/condition/club-drug-use/,"Club drugs are a group of drugs commonly found at parties, bars, nightclubs, and concerts. They are often used for the purpose of getting high and impair your judgment. Most forms of the drugs are illegal and can cause serious illness, injury, or even death. This can occur from one-time use, repeated use, or use with other substances, such as alcohol.

• Flunitrazepam (roofies)
• GHB (liquid ecstasy)
• Ketamine (special K)
• LSD (acid)
• MDMA (ecstasy or molly)
• Methamphetamine (meth)

Club drugs contain a combination of agents that affect your brain and central nervous system. All of them can lead you to make choices or do things you wouldn’t otherwise do.

• Stimulants make you excitable. They can cause you to feel open, aroused, and unafraid.
• Depressants slow your nervous system and affect your ability to react.
• Hallucinogens affect your ability to think, feel, judge, and act. They make it hard to know what’s real or not. They can cause you to forget periods of time.
• Methamphetamines are stimulants that cause excitement. They can make you hyper, anxious, or paranoid.",null,null,null,"Some people choose to use club drugs. Although most club drugs look like prescription medicines, they’re not safe. Club drugs that contain meth are very addictive. These drugs may be mixed or cut to include meth. These include GHB, ketamine, and flunitrazepam. They can cause severe, long-lasting symptoms and medical problems with repeated use.

Club drugs are often laced with other harmful chemicals, as well.

You should be careful not to consume club drugs. Most of them have no color, smell, or taste. They can easily be slipped into drinks and food. Some types, including GHB and flunitrazepam, often are used as date-rape drugs. A small amount can cause a person to blackout or become unconscious.

Teenagers and young adults are more often victims of date rape. Talk with your children about the dangers of club drugs. They can help prevent someone giving them drugs by doing the following:

• Don’t accept drinks, food, or substances from other people. This includes strangers and people they don’t know very well.
• Don’t drink or eat anything they didn’t open themselves.
• Keep drinks with them and in their sight at all times.
• Watch their friends’ drinks.

Everyone reacts differently to club drugs. Symptoms vary depending on the person, the drug, and the dose of the drug. Side effects often appear 10 to 20 minutes after use. They can include:

• Drowsiness
• Dizziness
• Blurred vision
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Loss of muscle control
• Changes in heart rate and blood pressure
• Trouble breathing
• Aggressive behavior
• Impaired memory and judgment
• Hallucinations
• Loss of consciousness
• Seizures
• Death

It’s important to know when someone has taken drugs, either on purpose or by accident. Look for any of the side effects listed above. Club drugs also can cause people to overheat. If a friend looks too hot or feels weak or sick, get them to a cool, quiet place as soon as you can. If the person is thirsty, give them a sports drink instead of water. If they vomit, lose consciousness, or have seizures, get medical help right away.

Alert a manager, security person, or law official if you suspect someone is trying to give you or a friend a club drug.",null,null,"• Will I be addicted if I use club drugs once?

If it sounds bad or made up, it probably is. Some drugs are legal for certain health problems. However, you should never take any drugs that are not part of a prescription.

Buying club drugs and opioids on the internet and through social media has become increasingly easy for kids and young adults in recent years. Be aware of certain images, names and codes related to the sale of these drugs and talk to your doctor about what to look for."
84,Clubfoot,https://familydoctor.org/condition/clubfoot/,"Clubfoot is a congenital condition (present at birth) that causes a baby’s foot to turn inward or downward. It can be mild or severe and occur in one or both feet. In babies who have clubfoot, the tendons that connect their leg muscles to their heel are too short. These tight tendons cause the foot to twist out of shape.

Clubfoot is one of the most common congenital birth defects. It occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 babies born in the U.S. and affects more boys than girls. In fact, boys are twice as likely to be born with clubfoot.

Usually, a baby born with a clubfoot is otherwise healthy. In a small percentage of births, it occurs as part of a more serious condition like spina bifida.

Clubfoot is not a painful condition for your baby. Most of the time, clubfoot can be corrected while your child is a still a baby. Treatment should begin a week or two after birth. Correction methods vary from manual foot manipulation over time to surgically fixing the foot.

There is a high success rate for treating clubfoot. After correction, your child should be able to participate in a variety of physical activities and lead a normal life. Children who do not get treatment for clubfoot will not be able to walk normally. Their foot or feet will remain deformed.","The symptoms of clubfoot vary but are easy to identify by a medical professional. Clubfoot could be more difficult to spot if you are a first-time parent and if the condition is not severe.

• A foot that turns inward and downward, with toes pointing toward the opposite foot.
• The foot, heel, and calf muscle on one side may be smaller than the other.
• In severe cases, the clubfoot may be twisted upside down.","Doctors are not sure what causes clubfoot. There is some evidence to suggest that there is a genetic link. This means it seems to run in families. Also, if you already have one child born with clubfoot, your next child has a greater risk of also having clubfoot.

There is also research to suggest clubfoot is more common in babies whose mothers smoked or used recreational drugs (street drugs) during pregnancy. This is especially true if there is already a family history of clubfoot. Plus, there could be a link between low amniotic fluid and clubfoot. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds a baby in the womb.

If you are pregnant and have a family history of clubfoot, you may want to meet with a genetic counselor. He or she will be able to tell you more about the chances that your baby will have clubfoot.","In most cases, clubfoot is diagnosed after your baby is born. Your doctor will be able to identify clubfoot based on the appearance of your baby’s foot. Sometimes after a visual inspection of the foot, they may also order an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis.

Clubfoot also can be discovered in utero (while the baby is still in the mother’s womb) during an ultrasound. An ultrasound is a type of imaging used to look at babies in the womb. It is routine for a woman to have an ultrasound during her pregnancy to confirm her baby’s growth and development.

Even if clubfoot is discovered in utero, there is nothing that can be done to correct it until after the baby is born.","You cannot prevent clubfoot because no one is sure what causes it. You may be able to lower the risk of clubfoot by not smoking or using recreational drugs if you are pregnant.

However, with treatment, your child should be able to participate in a variety of physical activities and lead a normal life.","There are two primary ways to treat clubfoot. One way involves stretching to reshape the foot. The other involves surgery. Most cases of clubfoot can be successfully treated without surgery.

For most babies, stretching and reshaping the foot is the best treatment option. There are a few reliable techniques for treating clubfoot with stretching. The most widely used is called the Ponseti method. Treatment usually begins as soon as possible after birth, typically within the first week. This is the best and easiest time to reshape the foot.

When clubfoot is severe, surgery is often the best option for your baby. The surgeon (usually an orthopedic surgeon) will work to lengthen the tendons in the foot and may also need to realign the bones and joints.

Following surgery, your baby will likely also wear a cast for a few months. Your doctor may also prescribe special shoes and a brace for your baby once the cast is removed.

In rare cases, clubfoot is not completely correctable. Most of the time, babies who had clubfoot and received treatment can lead active lives as they get older.","If your child’s clubfoot is not treated, they will not be able to walk normally. It is sometimes possible to walk with clubfoot, but it is very difficult. Children who have clubfoot tend to walk on the sides of their feet. This can cause large callouses and chronic pain.

As your child gets older, having uncorrected clubfoot will mean having a less active lifestyle.","• If I had clubfoot, how likely is it that my baby will have it?
• What kind of follow-up care will my baby need?
• Will my baby have full use of the foot after treatment?
• Will my child be able to play sports?
• Are there any long-term side effects of having a treated clubfoot?

Your doctor (or orthopedic specialist) will stretch your baby’s foot toward the correct position and then place a cast on it to hold it there. Every week or so, the doctor will remove the cast, stretch the foot further toward the correct position, and re-cast it. This will continue until the foot is fully in the correct position (usually several months).

Sometimes, the doctor will also need to clip a portion of the Achilles tendon that connects your baby’s heel to his or her calf muscle. Doing so will allow the tendon to grow to a normal length. If this is required, the doctor will do the clipping before putting on your baby’s final cast.

Once the final cast is off, your baby will probably need to wear special shoes and possibly a brace. They won’t have to wear these things forever. It could be several months or even a few years. You’ll also need to continue doing stretching exercises with your baby."
85,Colds and the Flu,https://familydoctor.org/condition/colds-and-the-flu/,"A cold and the flu are viral infections. They both affect your respiratory system. This includes your throat, nose, airway and lungs. It is difficult to tell the two apart. The flu is generally worse than a cold. It is common to get a cold more than once a year. Most people get the flu only a few times every 10 years.","A cold and the flu have similar symptoms. However, they are two different conditions.

• Fever up to 102°F
• Runny or stuffy nose
• Green or yellow nasal discharge
• Sore throat
• Cough
• Sneezing
• Feeling tired
• Muscle aches
• Headache
• Watery eyes
• Symptoms develop slowly
• Symptoms are mild

• Fever over 102°F
• Stuffy nose
• Nausea
• Chills and sweats
• Feeling tired
• Muscle aches, especially in back, legs, and arms
• Cough
• Headache
• Poor appetite
• Symptoms appear suddenly
• Symptoms are more intense

One particular type of flu is considered serious. It is called H1N1 flu. Some people call it swine flu. It is a respiratory infection. It is caused by a virus found in pigs. It can infect humans. Its symptoms are similar to other flu symptoms.

For a common cold or the flu, you don’t need to see your doctor. However, if your symptoms become serious, call or see your doctor. Serious symptoms for children include:

• High fever (above 103°F)
• Fever that lasts for more than 3 days
• Trouble breathing, fast breathing, or wheezing
• Bluish skin color
• Earache or ear drainage
• Difficulty waking up
• Irritability
• Seizures
• Symptoms that improve and then return with a fever or worse cough
• Worsening of chronic medical conditions (such as diabetes or heart disease)
• Vomiting or stomach pain

• A high, prolonged fever (above 102°F) with fatigue and body aches
• Symptoms that last longer than 10 days or get worse
• Trouble breathing or shortness of breath
• Chest pain or pressure
• Fainting or feeling like you are going to faint
• Confusion or disorientation
• Severe or persistent vomiting
• Severe sinus pain in your face or forehead
• Swollen gland in the neck or jaw

Cold and flu symptoms can last between 2 and 14 days.",Viruses cause colds and the flu. More than 200 different viruses can cause colds. Not as many viruses cause the flu. That’s why there’s a vaccine available for the flu and not for colds.,"There is no test to diagnose a cold. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and suggest treating the symptoms. If your doctor suspects you have the flu, he or she may test you. The test involves swabbing the inside of your nose or back of your throat. Results are available fairly quickly.","There are things you can do to reduce your risks for colds and flu. They include:

• Wash your hands frequently. Use soap. This stops the spread of germs.
• Eat healthy, exercise, and get enough sleep. These things boost your immune system.
• Cough and sneeze into the inside of your elbow (not your hands).
• Clean common surfaces, such as tables, counters, toys, door handles and bathrooms. Use anti-bacterial disinfectants.
• Get a flu vaccine (shot or nasal spray). It is available through flu season. The best time is October and November. The flu shot is safe for adults and all children 6 months of age and older. It is strongly recommended that all children 6 months of age to 59 months of age get a yearly flu shot. The nasal-spray vaccine contains live but weakened viruses. It is safe for adults and all children 2 years of age and older who do not have asthma or breathing problems. Talk to your doctor before getting the nasal spray vaccine. You cannot get the flu from the flu shot or the nasal-spray vaccine. Some people who get the vaccine will still get the flu. They usually get a milder case than people who aren’t vaccinated. The vaccine is recommended for people who are more likely to get really sick from flu-related complications.","There’s no cure for the common cold or the flu. Antibiotics do not work against the viruses that cause colds and the flu. The illness has to run its course. You can do some things to ease your symptoms. For a low fever, mild aches, and pains, take products such as acetaminophen (one brand: Tylenol), naproxen (one brand: Aleve) or ibuprofen (one brand: Advil). Drink plenty of fluids. Get as much sleep as you can. Stay home to avoid spreading germs to others.

Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine for the flu. This only shortens the length of time you are sick. These medicines come as pills, syrup or in an inhaler. The inhaled type may cause problems for some people who have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Some antiviral medicines can cause nausea and vomiting.

When easing a child’s symptoms, acetaminophen (one brand: Children’s Tylenol) can help ease pain and lower a fever. Be sure you are giving your child the correct dose according to his or her age and weight.

To treat your child’s cold or the flu, make sure that your child rests. Give him or her plenty of fluids. Use a humidifier to moisten the air in your child’s bedroom. This will help with nasal congestion. Use a saline nasal spray to thin nasal mucus. Use a bulb syringe to suction mucus out of your baby or child’s nose.","Cold and flu symptoms are uncomfortable. You will not feel well for the time it takes your cold and flu to run its course. Ease your symptoms with rest, fluids, over-the-counter medicine, and blowing your nose.","• How long will my cold or flu symptoms last?
• How long should I or my child stay home?
• Do all cold and flu medicines require prescriptions?
• Can I get the flu vaccine while I’m sick?
• Is the vaccine effective after I’ve had the flu?

86,Colic,https://familydoctor.org/condition/colic/,"Colic is when an otherwise healthy baby cries or fusses frequently for no clear reason. It’s defined as crying for more than 3 hours a day at least 3 days per week for more than 3 weeks. Sometimes there’s nothing you can do to relieve your baby’s crying. Managing colic can add stress to already tired or stressed new parents.

Colic in babies can start a few weeks after birth. It’s generally the worst between 4 and 6 weeks of age. Babies usually grow out of colic by the time they are 3 to 4 months old.","It’s normal for babies to fuss and cry. Babies who have colic cry more than most babies, even though they’re otherwise healthy. Other features of colic can include:

• Crying for no obvious reason. For example, if they’re not hungry or don’t need a diaper change.
• Crying around the same time each day. Colicky babies often get fussy toward the end of the day. However, the crying can happen at any time.
• Clenching their fists when crying or curling up their legs.
• Crying like they’re in pain.
• Turning bright red when crying.

When your baby cries, they can swallow air. This may give your baby gas. It can make their tummy look swollen or feel tight. They might show some relief in symptoms after passing gas or having a bowel movement (pooping).","Doctors aren’t sure what causes colic. Some of the contributing factors could include:

• Pain or discomfort from gas or indigestion
• A digestive system that isn’t fully developed
• Overfeeding or underfeeding
• Sensitivity to formula or breast milk
• Overstimulation
• Early form of childhood migraine headache
• Emotional reaction to fear, frustration, or excitement",Your baby’s doctor can diagnose colic. They will do a physical exam and review your baby’s history and symptoms. The doctor might perform some tests to rule out other possible problems.,You can’t prevent or avoid your baby from being colicky.,null,"Colic doesn’t cause any short-term or long-term problems for your baby. But colic can be difficult for parents. It can be hard to care for babies who don’t stop crying. You may feel overwhelmed or frustrated. If you’re feeling this way, it’s important to ask for help. Ask someone close to you to help watch your baby. Never shake or harm your child. Shaking a baby can cause serious brain damage and even death. If you feel like you might shake or harm your baby, get help right away.

The following are things to keep in mind about colic:

• You didn’t cause the colic, so try not to feel guilty.
• Colic will go away. Most babies outgrow it by the time they are 3 to 4 months old.
• Just because your baby has colic doesn’t mean they’re unhealthy.
• There are many ways to soothe your baby.
• Giving your baby extra attention, such as holding them for extended periods, won’t spoil them.","• When will my baby get over colic?
• What is the best way to feed my baby to avoid colic?
• Should I hold my baby upright for a certain amount of time after they eat?

There are ways you can avoid these triggers. There are also things you can try to help soothe your baby and reduce their crying.

If you’re breastfeeding your baby:

• Keep track of what you eat and drink. Everything you consume gets passed to your baby and can affect them.
• Avoid caffeine and chocolate, which act as stimulants.
• Avoid dairy products and nuts in case your baby is allergic to them.
• Ask your doctor if any medicines you’re taking could be causing the problem.

If you’re feeding your baby formula:

• Try a different brand. Babies can be sensitive to certain proteins in formula.
• Try feeding your baby smaller meals but more often.
• Avoid feeding your baby too much or too quickly. One bottle feeding should last about 20 minutes. If your baby eats faster, try using a nipple with a smaller hole. This will slow down their feeding.
• Try warming the formula to body temperature.
• Try feeding your baby in an upright position.

Babies who have colic can sometimes respond well to different ways of being held or rocked, including:

• Across your arm or lap while you massage their back
• Upright, if they have gas
• Rocking your baby in your arms or by using an infant swing

Try these movements and stimuli to sooth your baby:

• Provide extra skin-to-skin contact.
• Swaddle your baby. This mean wrapping them in a blanket.
• Sing to your baby.
• Give your baby a warm (not hot) bath or put a warm towel on their stomach.
• Massage your baby. Ask your doctor for guidelines.
• Provide white noise, such as a fan, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, hair dryer, or dishwasher.
• Give your baby a pacifier.
• Go for a walk with your baby in their stroller. Or go for a drive with your baby in their car seat.
• Give your baby simethicone drops. This over-the-counter medicine can help relieve gas.

• Your baby’s crying is mixed with a fever, vomiting, loose or bloody stools, or decreased movement.
• Your baby’s crying or behavior changes suddenly."
87,Colorectal Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/colorectal-cancer/,"Colorectal cancer starts in the tissue of the colon or the rectum (the largest part of the intestine located near the anus). Because they share common features, these two cancers are often referred to as colorectal cancer. Cancers start when cells in your body grow quickly in an abnormal way.

A colorectal cancer screening procedure, known as a colonoscopy, is the most effective method of checking for cancer. When colorectal cancer is discovered early, it’s usually treatable and not life threatening. However, it can lead to death if found too late to be treated.","The primary symptom of colorectal cancer is a polyp (growth) in the lining of your colon or rectum. If you have one, you may not even know. Polyps can only be seen with a special camera during a colonoscopy. Some polyps aren’t harmful, but some can become cancerous.

Once a polyp develops, it may lead to the following symptoms:

• Bleeding from your rectum
• Blood in your stool or in the toilet after you have a bowel movement
• Changes in the shape or consistency of your stool (diarrhea or constipation lasting several weeks)
• Stomach/abdominal cramps
• Stomach discomfort, such has the urge to have a bowel movement when you don’t really need to have one
• Weakness or fatigue
• Unplanned weight loss

Other medical conditions can cause these same symptoms. See your doctor right away to find what’s causing your symptoms.","There is no single cause. However, there are several things that can increase your risk for colorectal cancer. These include:

• Age (especially over 50)
• Ethnicity, especially African Americans and Jews of Eastern European or Russian ancestry
• Prior history of polyps
• Family history of colorectal cancer
• Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease
• Inherited genetic syndromes (Lynch syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome)
• Poor diet, specifically a low-fiber, high-fat diet
• Lack of exercise
• Type 2 diabetes
• Obesity
• Smoking
• Having more than three alcoholic drinks per day
• Previous radiation treatment for cancer

Beginning at age 45, doctors recommend, in general, you undergo screening every five to 10 years. If you fall into one of the groups above, you may need to be tested at a younger age and more often. You may also need to be test more often depending on past results or testing methods. Doctors have seen an increase in colon cancer cases in younger people in the last 5 to 10 years.","Colorectal cancer is diagnosed through several methods.

Routine screening tests can find polyps or cancers before they’re large enough to cause symptoms. This is when the cancer can be more effectively treated.

If you have symptoms, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam. In this exam, your doctor will put his or her gloved finger into your rectum to feel for growths. It’s not painful. However, it can be uncomfortable.

A colonoscopy is the most effective screening test for detecting colorectal cancer. This test involves inserting a thin, flexible tube into your rectum. The tube is connected to a small video camera that can see your entire colon. The tube also can be used to remove polyps and cancers during the exam. Before you have this test, you are given a medicine to make you sleepy. A colonoscopy may be uncomfortable. It’s usually not painful.

Additional tests might include:

• Barium enema. For this test, you are given an enema (fluid injected into the rectum). The liquid contains a dye that makes your colon show up on an X-ray. Your doctor looks at the X-ray to find abnormal spots in your entire colon. If they find one or detects polyps, your doctor will probably order a colonoscopy.
• Fecal occult blood test. This test checks your stool for blood that you can’t see. Your doctor gives you a test kit and instructions to use it at home. Then, you return a stool sample to your doctor for testing. If the lab finds blood, another test is done to look for a polyp, cancer, or another cause of bleeding.
• Stool DNA test. This test checks your stool for cells that are shed by colon cancers or precancerous polyps. If your test is positive, your doctor will probably want you to have a colonoscopy.
• Virtual colonoscopy. This test uses a computerized tomography (CT) machine to take pictures of your colon. Your doctor can then see all the images combined in a computer to check for polyps or cancer. If your doctor finds polyps or other abnormalities, you will need to have a traditional colonoscopy for further testing or to remove them.
• Flexible sigmoidoscopy. In this test, your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube with a light on the end into your rectum. The tube is connected to a tiny video camera so the doctor can look at the rectum and the lower part of your colon. This test can be done in your doctor’s office. It lets your doctor see polyps when they are very small (before they can be found with a fecal occult blood test). Flexible sigmoidoscopy may miss cancerous polyps that are in the upper part of the colon. Therefore, some doctors prefer a colonoscopy. Your doctor will discuss options with you.

If you’ve been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, your cancer will be given a stage. Cancer stages include stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV. Stage IV is considered advanced cancer. Stage I cancers offer more hope in a successful outcome after treatment.

The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends screening for colorectal cancer with fecal tests, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy (tests used to diagnose colorectal cancer) starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75 years.

For adults between the ages of 76 and 85, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that the decision to screen for colorectal cancer be an individual one. Your doctor will offer advice based on your overall health and prior screening history. The AAFP recommends against screening for colorectal cancer in adults older than 85 years.","Colorectal cancer can’t be prevented or avoided. However, you can reduce your risk by choosing a healthy diet and exercising. Also, lose weight, quit smoking, and reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. Genetics tests can tell you if you carry an inherited gene that increases your risk of colorectal cancer. Discuss this option with your doctor, including the costs. You can also catch it early by following screening guidelines.","If you have colorectal cancer, your doctor will talk to you about treatment options. These include:

• This is usually the main treatment for colon and rectal cancer. It removes the tumor.
• This is treatment with drugs that kill cancer cells that may have been left behind after a tumor is removed by surgery. It’s often used when there is a risk the colon or rectal cancer will come back. Chemotherapy is usually combined with another treatment called immunotherapy. During immunotherapy, a person takes drugs that help the immune system fight cancer. Research has shown the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is better than chemotherapy alone. Sometimes chemotherapy can be used before surgery to shrink the size of a tumor.
• Also known as radiation, this treatment uses high-power X-rays to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy can be used in many ways. Radiation may be used either before or after surgery for rectal cancer. It can also be combined with chemotherapy after surgery. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation have been shown to improve the outcome in rectal cancer treatment. Sometimes, radiation is given before surgery for rectal cancer to shrink the tumor and prevent return of the cancer in that area. If you have stage II or III colorectal cancer, the risk of cancer coming back is significant. There’s a risk the cancer may come back in your pelvic area. Your doctor will likely recommend radiation and surgery since radiation reduces this risk.
• Targeted therapy.These are drugs that attack the type of cancer cells you have. This treatment is used for advanced colon cancer.

Cancer treatment affects people differently. Some people have few or no side effects. However, many people feel very sick.

Talk to your doctor about clinical trials available to people with colorectal cancer. Clinical trials offer new research-based treatments that may or may not be effective. People enrolled in clinical trials must qualify for the trial.","Living with colorectal cancer can cause fear and discomfort, depending on the stage of your cancer. If you were treated successfully and are cancer free, you’ll be required to have regular screenings the rest of your life.","• What are the age guidelines for colorectal cancer screening?
• Is it too late to successfully beat colorectal cancer if I see blood in my stool?
• If I have surgery to remove all or part of my colon, will I have to have a colostomy bag?
• What is the recurrence rate for colorectal cancer caught and treated early?
• What are other reasons for blood in my stool?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Colorectal (Colon) Cancer

88,Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/complex-regional-pain-syndrome/,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition. It can occur after an injury. It usually affects an arm or a leg. It can also occur in other areas of the body. In rare cases, it develops after surgery, heart attack, or other medical problem. The pain is often described as a burning feeling. It is usually much worse than what’s considered normal for the injury. Your doctor may also call this condition reflex sympathetic dystrophy or causalgia.","• A painful (often burning) feeling in the affected area. This is usually an arm, leg, hand, or foot. It often occurs long past the time when your injury should have healed.
• The affected skin may be tender to the touch. It could be swollen and very sensitive to hot or cold temperatures.
• Change in skin color. It often turns red, blue, purple, or blotchy.
• Change in skin texture. The skin over the affected area may become thin or shiny.
• Stiffness and pain in the joints.
• Muscle pain and weakness.
• Loss of mobility in the affected area.

Some people’s symptoms are mild and eventually go away. For others, symptoms can be severe and cause long-term disability.","It is believed that CRPS happens because of damage to the nervous system. It may happen if the nervous system malfunctions. In most cases, it is triggered by an injury or trauma. These could include:

• Fractures
• Sprains/strains
• Burns, cuts, or bruises
• Surgery
• Minor procedures, such as a needle stick

Anyone at any age can get CPRS. It is more common in women. It seems to peak around age 40. It is uncommon in children and rare in the elderly.",Your doctor will ask you about your pain symptoms. He or she will physically examine you. There is not one specific test that can diagnose CRPS. Some tests may rule out another cause to your symptoms. An MRI may show changes in the tissue of the affected limb. Or it may verify that no other structural damage has occurred.,CRPS is not predictable. The only way to prevent or avoid it is to try to avoid being injured.,"A variety of therapies are commonly used to treat CRPS:

• Physical therapy. Keeping the body part moving increases circulation and promotes healing.
• Psychotherapy. People in chronic pain may develop mental health disorders. These include depression or anxiety. They can heighten pain. Psychotherapy helps you cope with the pain. It also helps you cope with any conditions that develop.
• Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). These can help with pain and inflammation. These medicines include aspirin (Bayer), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve). They are available over the counter. Talk to your doctor before using NSAIDs.
• Prescription medications. If your pain is severe, your doctor may prescribe medicines that block certain nerves. Sometimes steroids help swelling and pain. Some medicines used for depression and seizures also help chronic pain. Narcotics and other pain medications may not control the pain of CRPS. Sometimes a combination of medicine is necessary.
• Sympathetic nerve block. This is an injection of an anesthetic (pain reliever) into certain nerves. This blocks the pain signals. If the injection relieves the pain, it may be repeated. It is not a cure.
• Sympathectomy of the injured nerve. A surgeon will cut or clamp the nerve chain. This has been reported to improve pain caused by CRPS.
• Neural stimulation. This involves stimulating nerves with electrical or magnetic currents. Some types, such as spinal cord stimulation, require minor surgery.

A treatment that works for one person may not work for another. An individual treatment plan must be made for each person.","With early treatment, you may keep complex regional pain syndrome from getting worse. Sometimes the condition improves. If treatment is started early enough, the symptoms may completely go away. People with long-lasting, more severe symptoms often don’t respond to treatment. These people may benefit from a pain management program aimed specifically at dealing with chronic pain.","• What is the likely cause of my pain?
• If my injury has healed, why am I still in pain?
• Do I need any tests?
• What is the best treatment option for me? Do I need medicine? Physical therapy? Counseling?
• When can I expect relief from my pain?
• Will alternative therapies, such as yoga or acupuncture, help relieve my pain?","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Fact Sheet

89,Concussion,https://familydoctor.org/condition/concussion/,"A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Most often, it occurs when you hit your head hard against an object. This is sometimes called a blow to the head. It also can happen from a blow to your neck or body. This causes sudden head movement that jars, or shakes, your brain.

A concussion may be mild or severe. It can have serious effects, including damage to your brain cells. It can also affect chemicals in your brain and body.

More than half of the emergency room visits for TBIs are for children 5 to 18 years of age.","Most people with concussions stay awake after getting hurt. However, some people may lose consciousness. Concussion symptoms may show up right away. Some may even appear hours or days later. Symptoms include:

• Headache or pressure in your head.
• Trouble focusing.
• Memory loss.
• Dazed appearance.
• Confusion.
• Dizziness or balance problems.
• Blurry vision.
• Trouble hearing.
• Slow response to questions.
• Nausea and/or vomiting.
• Sensitivity to light or noise.
• Changes in mood or behavior.
• Changes in sleep, including trouble falling asleep or sleeping more than usual.

If you may have a concussion, get help right away for the following. Someone may need to help you call for help.

• Symptoms that get worse, such as headache.
• Frequent vomiting.
• Inability to wake up.
• Ongoing confusion.
• Trouble speaking, walking, or making eye contact.
• Weakness or numbness in your arms or legs.
• Loss of consciousness.
• Seizures.","Sports are a main cause of concussions. Concussions can occur during practice or a game. They can happen in a fall, wreck, or accident. Sports most linked to concussions are:

• football
• basketball
• soccer
• rugby
• lacrosse
• baseball
• biking or cycling","Contact your doctor if you have concussion symptoms after a blow to your head, neck, or body. He or she will want to know how you got hurt. He or she may test your senses, balance, reflexes, memory, and thinking. Your doctor may order tests to scan your brain. These include computed tomography, also known as a CT scan. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, is another test. These scans take pictures of your brain, and check for bleeding, swelling, or fractures.","There’s no guaranteed way to prevent concussions. However, you can lower your risk.

• Learn proper techniques for your sport or activity.
• Follow all safety rules.
• Use the right protective gear in sports. Make sure it fits and is in good condition.
• Wear a seatbelt in the car.
• Wear a helmet on a bicycle and motorcycle.
• Keep your house free of hazards that could cause trips or falls.","If you have a concussion, your brain needs time to heal. It’s important to get plenty of rest. Take a break from physical activities. You also should take a mental rest. This means no reading, watching TV, or using a phone or computer. You may need to stay home from work or school for a while. Talk to your doctor about when you can return to your normal routine.

• Drink plenty of fluids, such as water.
• Eat healthy foods.
• Get enough sleep.
• Avoid alcohol.
• Avoid operating vehicles or machines.
• Avoid activities that may worsen symptoms or affect your balance. These include being on airplanes, trains, or boats.
• Ask your doctor about taking any medicines.

When you have a concussion, your emotions may change. You may feel frustrated, angry, sad, or confused. Tell your doctor, family, and friends what you’re feeling. They can help provide support.","Most people get better after a concussion and don’t have lasting brain damage. However, the injury does put you at risk of post-concussion syndrome (PCS). PCS can cause symptoms to last for months or years. Ongoing memory problems are an example.

Don’t return to activities before making a full recovery. A second blow to the head, even a minor one, can be dangerous. You could get a rare condition called second impact syndrome. This is rapid brain swelling that can lead to death.

Having one concussion puts you at risk for future ones. The more concussions you have, the worse they can be. Brain damage can build up and cause other brain injuries.","• Could I have a concussion without knowing it?
• Are there any medicines I can take to make my symptoms go away?
• What should I do if my symptoms get worse?
• When can I return to my normal routine, including sports?
• If I’ve had a concussion, what is my risk of having another one?","American Academy of Family Physicians: Concussions in Kids

90,Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia/,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) affects your adrenal glands. These glands sit atop your kidneys and produce different hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Both are essential for life. People who have the condition lack an enzyme to make the hormones. CAH also causes the adrenal glands to over-produce the male sex hormone androgen. This hormone causes males characteristics to appear early or inappropriately (in the case of women).,"CAH symptoms vary based on the degree of your condition. Severe cases usually show up before or at birth. Females can be born with unclear genitals. This means that their genitals may look more male than female. As they get older, girls could develop facial hair and a deep voice. They also may have abnormal or no menstrual periods. Boys can be born with an enlarged penis.

Other severe CAH symptoms for girls and boys can start a few weeks after birth. These include:

• Uneven heart rate
• Poor eating or feeding
• Vomiting
• Dehydration
• Abnormal electrolyte levels

Most people who have CAH have a mild form. Symptoms are delayed until childhood or puberty. Boys can develop muscles and masculine features early. Girls can have irregular periods and eventually, infertility issues. They also may have some masculine features.

People who have CAH often are tall as children, but shorter than average as adults. They may have worse acne and blood pressure problems. When they get colds or infections, it can take them longer to recover.",We produce hormones in our adrenal glands. People who have CAH lack all or part of an enzyme to make correct hormone levels. They don’t make enough cortisol and aldosterone. They make too much of a male sex hormone called androgen.,"CAH can be diagnosed before or at birth, or later in life. The timeframe depends on the degree of your condition. The more severe it is, the earlier your doctor can diagnose it. Blood tests can check your hormone levels. Genetic tests also can confirm the disorder.

Some states include CAH in newborn screening done at the hospital. This is part of the heel-prick blood process. The sample checks for several congenital diseases.","You cannot prevent CAH. It is a genetic disorder. You can get it from your parents or a random gene mutation. If you have the condition, you can pass it on to your children.

If you are planning a family and you or someone in your family has CAH, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may suggest an amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. These tests can diagnose CAH before your baby is born. If your baby has CAH, they can get treatment in the womb. Your doctor can give them medicine to help correct hormone levels.","The main goal of CAH treatment is to manage your hormones. You want them to be normal or as close to normal as possible. Hydrocortisone increases your cortisol level. You may need extra medicine when you are stressed or sick. The use of steroids is common. Your doctor will prescribe a dose that replaces the hormones you can’t produce naturally. This medicine usually has low or no side effects. Do not stop taking steroids without your doctor’s orders.

Babies who are born with unclear genitals may require surgery. Your doctor will check chromosomes to confirm the genetic sex. This is called karyotyping.","Currently, there is no cure for CAH. Your doctor will want to closely monitor your hormone levels. They will order routine blood tests to ensure your medicine is working. Some symptoms of CAH may be hard to handle on an emotional level. You might consider a support group or therapy to help.","• If I have CAH, what are the chances I will pass it to my baby?
• Does having CAH make it more difficult to get pregnant?
• Are there any long-term health problems associated with CAH?
• Can you recommend a support group for people who have CAH?","National Adrenal Diseases Foundation: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

91,Congenital Heart Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/congenital-heart-disease/,"Congenital heart disease is a problem with the heart that is present at birth. “Congenital” is another way of saying your baby was born with it. It means the heart developed with an abnormality or weakness. The condition can be fatal.

Congenital heart problems are the most common kind of birth defect. They can be simple or complex. They could include:

• Heart valve defects
• A hole in the heart
• Defects in one of the chambers
• Heart muscle abnormalities","The symptoms depend on the type of problem. Some heart problems cause symptoms right away. Others cause symptoms as the child gets older. Sometimes there are never any symptoms. Many babies who have a congenital heart defect grow up to be healthy and strong.

Serious congenital heart defects may cause the following symptoms in newborns:

• Fast breathing
• A blue color to the skin, lips, and fingernails
• Fatigue or poor feeding
• Heart murmur (an extra sound heard when a doctor listens to the heart)

In older children or adults, congenital heart problems may cause symptoms such as:

• Heart murmur
• Shortness of breath
• Fatigue during exercise","Doctors don’t always know what causes a congenital heart defect. Some risk factors for congenital heart defects include:

• A family history of congenital heart problems
• Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome
• Certain infections during pregnancy, such as rubella
• Some medicines, chemicals, and alcohol

Heart problems have also been found in babies of women with diabetes who don’t control their blood sugar during pregnancy.

Some people with congenital heart problems are at a higher risk for other heart problems, including:

• Bacterial endocarditis. This is an infection of the heart valves or the lining of the heart chambers.
• Pulmonary hypertension. This is an increase in blood pressure going to the lungs.
• Arrhythmia. This is a heartbeat that’s too fast or too slow or skips a beat.
• Congestive heart failure. This is when a heart doesn’t pump blood like it should. This causes fluid to build up in the lungs or body.

Even if the problem is fixed, your child will need to be monitored for heart problems for the rest of his or her life.","Severe heart problems can be diagnosed during pregnancy with an ultrasound test. Sometimes, the problem is diagnosed right after the baby is born. Less severe heart problems may not be found until the child is older or even in adulthood.

Several tests can show what kind of heart disease your baby may have. They also help your doctor see how well the heart is working. A doctor will order tests if he or she suspects a congenital heart defect, or if your baby has a high risk factor. Here are some tests your baby might have:

• An ECG or EKG (electrocardiogram) measures electrical activity in the heart.
• Pulse oximetry shows how much oxygen is in the baby’s blood.
• A fetal ultrasound gives the doctor an ultrasound picture of the baby’s heart.
• A Chest X-ray shows how well the heart is growing and if your baby’s lungs have fluid in them.
• Cardiac catheterization uses dye in the heart to give the doctor a clear picture of the problem.
• Cardiovascular MRI is becoming more popular because it produces better pictures than other methods.","In many cases, there’s nothing you can do to prevent congenital heart disease. But there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your baby.

• Tell your doctor if you’re pregnant before taking any medicines.
• Ask your doctor what types of chemicals or substances could be harmful to your baby.
• If you have diabetes or gestational diabetes, get your blood sugar under control.
• Get a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella. If you’re not, get vaccinated right after delivery.","Treatment depends on the heart problem and how severe it is. Some people don’t need any treatment. Other heart problems need treatment with medicine, procedures, or surgery. Your doctor will talk to you about treatment options for you or your child.

Many babies with heart disease need medicine to make their heart stronger or to prevent other problems. It’s very important to give the medicine exactly as your doctor tells you.

Some babies need to have surgery. Some heart problems must be fixed as soon as the baby is born. Other problems can wait until the child is older. Sometimes the repair takes more than one operation. After surgery, your baby will probably stay in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a few days. There the doctors and nurses can keep a close watch. Many children are back to normal just a few days after heart surgery.","Babies with heart disease may get tired easily while they’re feeding. Try giving smaller amounts of milk at one time. Then feed your baby more often. He or she may need more food because a heart defect makes the heart work harder. This makes your baby burn more calories—just like you burn more calories when you exercise.

Caring for a baby or child with a heart problem can be emotional and stressful. You need all the information and support you can get. Connect with parents of other children with a heart problem. They understand what you’re going through and can share coping skills. Your child’s doctor can help connect you with support groups. Talk to a counselor if you’re having trouble coping. He or she can help you reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.","• What kind of heart problem does my child have?

92,Constipation,https://familydoctor.org/condition/constipation/,"Constipation is a common condition that makes it difficult to have a bowel movement. A bowel movement occurs when the food you eat passes through your digestive system. Your body takes the nutrients it needs from that food. What’s left over is called stool. Your stool can be soft or hard. Bowel movements usually happen on a regular basis.

Everyone has a bowel movement schedule (how often, how consistent, and what time of day it occurs). If your bowel movements become less frequent, are difficult to pass, and you are physically uncomfortable, you may be constipated. People of all ages experience constipation occasionally. Usually, it goes away and is not serious. See your doctor if your constipation is chronic (frequent). It may be a problem with your diet or health.","Basic symptoms of constipation include:

• Feeling like you still need to have a bowel movement, even after you’ve had one.
• Having hard, dry stool that is difficult to pass.
• Having fewer than 3 bowel movements in a week.
• Straining to have a bowel movement.

You should see your doctor if these symptoms do not go away. You should also see a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:

• Bleeding from your rectum or blood in your stool
• Constant pain in your abdomen
• Inability to pass gas
• Vomiting
• Fever
• Lower back pain
• Weight loss without trying

Chronic (ongoing) constipation can lead to complications, including:

• Anal fissure(a tear in the skin around your anus).
• Stool impaction (when your stool becomes too large to pass on your own).
• Hemorrhoids.
• Rectal prolapse (when a small piece of your intestine comes out of your anus from straining to have a bowel movement).
• Encopresis (when your bowels are so backed up that only liquid can pass through). Many people mistake this for diarrhea take anti-diarrheal medicine, making constipation even worse.

Complications of constipation can become serious if left untreated. They may require surgery.","You may be constipated for many different reasons. It may have more than one cause at a time, including:

• Diet (too many processed foods and not enough fiber)
• Certain medicines (opioid medicines given for pain and even too many laxatives, which usually help you have a bowel movement)
• Dehydration (especially not enough water)
• Too little physical activity
• Intestinal problems
• Major life changes, such as pregnancy

Constipation may become more common as you age. Certain diseases and disabilities also can cause constipation. These include multiple sclerosis, stroke, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and lupus.

Dehydration (not enough fluids) and dietary changes are the most common causes of constipation in babies. For example, changing from breast milk to cow’s milk or from baby food to solids can cause constipation.","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. This will include asking you about any medicines you take. Your doctor also will ask when you had your last bowel movement and how often you have them. It might be helpful to write it down for before your appointment. During the visit, your doctor may examine your rectum (the end of your large intestine near your anus). The doctor will insert his or her finger (while wearing rubber gloves) into your rectum to feel for blockages.

Your doctor may order additional tests, including a blood test and X-ray. A more thorough test is a colonoscopy. This is an invasive procedure done with anesthesia. During this test, your doctor will examine your colon with a long, flexible scope attached to a camera.","There are things you can do to reduce constipation. These include:

• Adding more fiber to your diet. Adults should eat between 20-35 grams of fiber each day. Foods, such as beans, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are high in fiber.
• Drinking more water. Being dehydrated causes your stool to dry out. This makes having a bowel movement more difficult and painful.
• Not waiting when you have to go. When you have the urge to have a bowel movement, don’t hold it in. This causes the stool to build up.
• Getting physical. Exercise is helpful in keeping your bowel movements regular.
• Being aware of medicines. Certain prescription medicines (especially pain medicines) can slow your digestive system. This causes constipation. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for this if you need these medicines.
• Talking to your doctor. Especially if you are being treated for certain diseases that are related to constipation. They may have additional guidance for lowering your risks.","Most cases of constipation are easy to treat at home with diet and exercise. Some cases require doctor recommendations, prescription medicine, or a medical procedure.

Diet: Eating a healthy diet with fiber and drinking plenty of fluids (water is the most helpful) can usually clear up constipation.

High fiber foods include beans, dried fruits, fresh fruits and vegetables, whole-grain foods (choose brown rice or whole wheat bread instead of white), flaxseed meal, and powdered products containing psyllium. For example, 3 cups of popped popcorn has a little more than 3 grams of fiber. One cup of oatmeal has 4 grams of fiber. Adding fiber to each meal and snack will help you reach your goal for the day. Fiber supplements are helpful. Processed foods, such as desserts and sugary drinks, only make constipation worse.

The amount of fiber you need each day varies:

• Men over the age of 50 should get at least 30 grams of fiber per day.
• Women over the age of 50 should get 21 grams per day.
• Children ages 1 to 3 should get 19 grams of fiber per day.
• Children between 4 and 8 years old should get 25 grams per day.
• Girls between 9 and 18 should get 26 grams of fiber each day.
• Boys of the same age range should get between 31 and 38 grams of fiber per day.

Bowel training: Teach your children to go to the bathroom when they have to. Holding it can lead to constipation. This also may be necessary for your elderly parents, if you are caring for them.

Laxatives: This is over-the-counter medicine that helps you have a bowel movement. Laxatives should only be used in rare instances. Do not use them on a regular basis. If you must use a laxative, bulk-forming laxatives are best (two brands: Metamucil and Benefiber). These work naturally to add bulk and water to your stools so they can pass easily. Bulk-forming laxatives can cause some bloating (when your stomach feels full) and gas.

There are other treatments that require consulting with your doctor:

Mineral oil: Do not use this without your doctor’s recommendation. Your doctor may recommend using it if you recently had surgery and should not strain for a bowel movement. Do not use it regularly. It causes your body to lose important vitamins: A, D, E and K.

Enema: This is a liquid medicine. It is inserted into your anus to help with constipation. It is often used after a surgery or before some medical procedures.

Prescription medicine: Your doctor will prescribe a medicine based on the reason for your constipation.

Surgery: This is rare. It might involve removing a damaged intestine for serious reasons.

Living with constipation can be uncomfortable and miserable. This is true when it’s just for just a couple of days. Long-lasting (chronic) constipation can be so uncomfortable that it influences how your clothes fit, what foods you eat, and your everyday activities. Keep a journal of your bowel movements to see what a normal bowel movement schedule is for you or your child. A normal schedule is between 3 times per day to 3 times per week. Try to keep your diet and lifestyle as routine as possible to prevent constipation.",null,"• Does aging play a significant role in constipation?

93,Corneal Abrasion | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/corneal-abrasions/,"Corneal abrasion symptoms and treatment are important to understand if you’ve scratched your eye. A corneal abrasion happens when the clear, protective layer on the front of your eye—the cornea—gets damaged. This can cause pain, redness, and blurry vision. Fortunately, most minor scratches heal quickly with the right care and follow-up.

A corneal abrasion is a type of eye injury that involves a cut or scratch on your cornea. The cornea is a clear layer of protective tissue at the front of your eye that lies over the iris (which is the colored part of your eye). The cornea helps focus light.","The cornea is very sensitive, so a corneal abrasion is usually quite painful. You may feel like you have sand or grit in your eye. You may notice tears or blurred vision, or your eye may look red. You may also notice that light hurts your eye. Some people also get a headache when they have a corneal abrasion.

If you wear contact lenses, you need to be especially careful with a corneal abrasion because you have a higher risk of infection. Your doctor may tell you not to wear your contact lenses for a few days after a corneal abrasion, especially if you’re treating your eye with medicated drops.

The cornea can also be scratched by a fingernail, a tree branch, or a contact lens that is dry or dirty. Rubbing your eyes very hard is another way that an abrasion can occur.

In some people, the outer layers of the cornea are weak. These people may get a corneal abrasion for no apparent reason.",Your doctor will examine your eye for any damage or particles that may be trapped under your eyelid. They may offer numbing drops to help with the pain so that you can keep your eye open for the exam. Your doctor may also place a yellow-orange dye on your eye (fluorescein drops) and then use a blue light. This helps the doctor see imperfection along the surface of your eye.,"Corneal abrasions can often by avoided by taking the following steps:

• Wear protective eye goggles when you’re around machinery that causes particles of wood, metal, or other materials to fly into the air (such as a chainsaw or a sandblaster).
• Keep your fingernails trimmed short. Cut infants’ and young children’s fingernails short, also.
• Trim low-hanging tree branches.
• Use care when putting in contact lenses. Make sure you clean them properly each day.
• Don’t sleep in your contact lenses.
• Avoid rubbing your eyes.","If you think something has gotten into your eye, first try to wash out the eye by flushing it with clean water or saline solution. Your workplace may have an eye rinse station for this purpose. Sometimes, blinking or pulling the upper eyelid over the lower eyelid may remove a particle from under the eyelid. Avoid rubbing your eye. If you or someone else notices something on the white part of your eye, use a soft tissue or cotton swab to gently lift it out of the eye. Don’t try to remove something that is directly over the cornea — this might cause more serious damage.

Call your doctor if you can’t remove the particle or if there doesn’t seem to be anything in your eye.

Your doctor will probably treat the abrasion with eye drops or ointment. Most small abrasions heal within 1 to 3 days. You may need to return to your doctor for another exam the next day.",null,"• Can a corneal abrasion cause permanent damage to my eye?

94,Coronary Artery Disease (CAD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/coronary-artery-disease-cad/,"Coronary artery disease is also called CAD. It is the most common form of heart disease in the U.S. — and is the leading cause of death, too. It occurs when the coronary arteries (blood vessels) that carry blood to your heart get blocked with plaque. That plaque collection is called atherosclerosis. Plaque is made of elements including fat and cholesterol. Over time, plaque can harden inside the walls of your arteries. When it does, it blocks the flow of blood to your heart. That blockage can cause angina (squeezing pain or pressure in your chest), a heart attack, or death. Coronary artery disease can lead to other problems, too, including heart failure and arrhythmias.","As your arteries become blocked over time, you may experience:

• Angina
• Tightness in your arms, back, the back of your neck, or jaw
• Shortness of breath
• Heart attack

Coronary artery disease may take years to develop. You may not notice symptoms until the disease has progressed far.","Coronary artery disease affects both men and women. Several factors can increase your risk of developing the disease, including:

• Family history
• High blood pressure
• High cholesterol
• Poor diet
• Obesity or being very overweight
• Not exercising (sedentary lifestyle)
• Other health conditions (such as diabetes)","Your doctor will perform a physical exam and listen to your heart. They will discuss your symptoms, family history, diet, activity level, and other medical conditions. There is no single test that can diagnose coronary artery disease. If you doctor suspects you have it, they may order one or more of the following tests:

• EKG (electrocardiogram). This is a painless, simple test that monitors your heart’s beat and rhythm. Also, it tests the strength and timing of your heart’s electrical signals. It involves putting electrodes (tiny pads attached to wires) on your chest. The pads are held in place by a sticky substance.
• Stress test. During this test, you will be asked to exercise to give your heart a workout. You will be connected to heart, blood pressure, and oxygen monitors during the test. These monitors can detect changes to your heart rate, rhythm, electrical activity, or blood pressure during the test. The staff will also monitor you for shortness of breath or chest pain. If you are unable to exercise for medical reasons, the staff will administer medicine to raise your heart rate. Your heart’s response to the workout may mean you have blockages and need further testing.
• Echocardiogram. This test is painless. It uses sound waves to see a picture of your heart while it’s beating. The picture will give doctors a look at the size and shape of your heart. Also, it shows your heart chambers and valves.
• Chest X-ray. This is an X-ray focused on your heart and lungs. The X-ray can detect signs of heart failure.
• Blood tests. Your doctor will take a sample of your blood to send to the lab. The lab can test for certain conditions that raise your risk of coronary artery disease. These include testing certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins.
• Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiogram. This procedure is done if other tests suggest you have coronary artery disease. It’s performed in a hospital. You will get medicine before the test to make you sleepy. However, you may remain awake. A thin, flexible tube is inserted into a blood vessel in your arm, groin, or neck. The doctor will move the tube to your coronary arteries, then inject a dye. An X-ray is used to monitor the dye as it travels through your coronary arteries. This helps the doctor see your blood flow through your heart and blood vessels. This test is generally painless.","Coronary artery disease can’t be completely prevented or avoided. This is because everyone develops some degree of CAD as we age. However, you can reduce your risks for getting the disease by:

• Quitting smoking. Nicotine raises your blood pressure, which contributes to coronary artery disease.
• Controlling your high blood pressure. Take your blood pressure medicine and follow a diet that helps lower your blood pressure.
• Eating healthy. Choose fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, and whole grains. Try to avoid processed foods, white flour, sugars, and high fructose corn syrup. The Mediterranean Diet is very good for heart health. If you have questions, talk to your doctor about how to make heart-healthy changes to your diet.
• Getting regular exercise. This can make your heart stronger and reduce your risk of heart disease.
• Taking vitamin supplements. A healthy diet will provide all the vitamins and minerals your body needs. For example, foods that are rich in vitamin E and beta-carotene are healthy and help reduce cardiovascular risk. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends against taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. There is no clear evidence that taking multivitamins offers additional protection.

Talk to your family doctor about how to improve your diet. Diet and lifestyle changes will lower your risk of coronary artery disease. Your body will need time to respond to the changes you make. Your doctor will watch your progress. For example, if your cholesterol level hasn’t improved after you’ve made changes for a few months, your doctor may prescribe medicine to lower it. You need to keep up the healthy lifestyle changes you started to help the medicine work.","Most people who have coronary artery disease take medicine to help control their condition. Medicines called beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates also can help relieve angina. Taking low-dose aspirin daily can reduce the chance of a second heart attack in people who have already had one. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors help lower blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart. Statins reduce the LDL cholesterol level in your blood. Your doctor will tell you whether you should take any of these medicines.

Medicines may have side effects. Aspirin may cause upset stomach. Nitrates may cause a flush (redness in the face) and headaches. Beta-blockers cause tiredness and sexual problems in some patients. Calcium channel blockers may cause constipation and leg swelling. Most patients don’t have side effects. If you have side effects after taking a medicine, tell your doctor.

Angioplasty is a surgery that opens blocked arteries around the heart. During this surgery, your doctor inserts a small tube, called a catheter, into an artery in your arm or leg. A small balloon and a metal stent are on the tip of the catheter. With a special instrument, the doctor threads the catheter from your arm or leg to the area around your heart. They will then inflate the balloon, which also moves the stent into place. The balloon moves the plaque out of the way. The stent keeps your artery open so the blood can flow properly to your heart.

Another surgical treatment for coronary artery disease is heart bypass surgery. Pieces of veins or arteries are often taken from the legs and sewn into the arteries of the heart. This moves blood past a blockage and increase the blood flow to the heart. Bypass surgery is usually done when angioplasty isn’t possible. Your doctor also may decide it’s a better choice for you.

Surgery has potential risks. These include heart attack, stroke, or death. These are rare and most patients do well. After angioplasty, you can usually expect to return to your previous activity level, or a better activity level, within a few days. It takes longer (a few weeks or months) to recover from heart bypass surgery.","Living with coronary artery disease means being aware of your risks and reducing the ones you can control. This includes diet, exercise, and stopping smoking. It is important to take your prescription medicine for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and any other health conditions.","• Does coronary artery disease ever go away?

95,Coronary Heart Disease (CHD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/coronary-heart-disease-chd/,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is also called coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CAD affects the larger coronary arteries on the surface of the heart. CHD is plaque buildup in your arteries. It’s known as hardening of the arteries, too. Arteries carry blood and oxygen to your heart. Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States for men and women.","CHD doesn’t always have symptoms. This is true in the early stages of the disease. Symptoms can vary in men and women.

• Chest pain or discomfort. This is known as angina. This happens when your heart lacks blood or oxygen. Angina can be stable or unstable. Activity or stress causes stable angina. Unstable angina is more dangerous. It can happen without warning. Symptoms of unstable angina include chest pain, tightness, or heaviness. People describe it as a squeezing feeling. The pain can spread to your arms, neck, stomach, back, or jaw, so don’t ignore pain in these areas.
• Shortness of breath. Also, you might feel tired or weak. Talk to your doctor about what to look for to help prevent and detect CHD.

Call 911 right away if you have those or any of the following abrupt symptoms. You might be having a heart attack or heart failure.

• Ongoing angina or chest pain that changes
• Dizziness
• Nausea or vomiting
• Sweating (with fever or chills)
• Swelling in your legs, ankles, feet, stomach, or the veins in your neck
• Numbness, particularly in your arms or chest","Coronary heart disease develops over time. It occurs as your arteries become blocked from plaque (fatty substances). This makes it hard for blood and oxygen to reach your heart. It puts stress on your heart, blood vessels, and body. If the plaque bursts, it can form a blood clot. A blood clot can produce a heart attack. If your brain lacks oxygen, you can have a stroke.","Your doctor can determine your risks for CHD. They may check your cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Your doctor also will want to know about your lifestyle and family history.

Currently, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends against electrocardiogram (ECG) screening for adults without symptoms and who are at low risk for CHD. The AAFP does not have enough data to recommend ECG screening for adults who don’t have symptoms but are at medium or high risk for CHD. In general, the greater the number of risk factors a person has, the more likely it is that the person will benefit from screening.

If you have symptoms, though, see your doctor. They will perform certain tests to diagnose CHD, including:

• Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This measures the rhythm, speed, and evenness of your heartbeat.
• Echocardiogram (echo). This produces an image of your heart using ultrasound.
• Chest X-ray. This produces an image of your heart and chest area using radiation.
• Exercise stress test. This checks your heart rate during activity.
• Coronary angiogram. This checks your arteries for flow and blockage. This test uses injected dye to take X-rays and monitor blood flow.
• Cardiac catheterization. This checks your arteries for flow and blockage. A catheter (thin tube) goes into your arteries from your groin, arm, or neck.
• Cardiac CT or MRI scan. This produces an image of your heart and arteries. This test uses radiation and contrast dye.","There are risk factors that increase your chance of getting CHD. Some of them you can prevent, including:

• Obesity or being overweight. Your doctor can help you calculate your body mass index (BMI). You should balance the numbrer of calories you consume and burn.
• Lack of exercise. Adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week. This includes fast walking, bicycling, or swimming. Increase this number if you need to lose weight. Children and teens should get at least 60 minutes of exercise every day.
• Poor diet. This plays a role in your body weight, cholesterol levels, and overall health. Learn how many calories you should consume in a day. Then, make it a point to eat foods high in nutrition. This includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, poultry, and fish. Limit your intake of fats, sodium (salt), sugar, and red meat.
• Smoking and alcohol. These unhealthy habits affect your oxygen level. They can damage your blood vessels and tighten your airways. Women should have no more than one drink per day. Men should have no more than two drinks per day. Talk to your doctor if you need help quitting alcohol or smoking.

Other CHD risk factors that you can manage or treat include:

• High cholesterol. Cholesterol is one substance that creates plaque. There are two types of cholesterol. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is bad. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is good. You should have low LDL and high HDL levels. You can help control these levels with medicine and a healthy lifestyle.
• High blood pressure. For most people, your blood pressure is high when it is at or above 130/80. Age and certain health conditions can affect normal blood pressure levels. You can help control your blood pressure with medicine. A healthy lifestyle and reduced stress also help.
• Certain health conditions.This includes conditions such as diabetes or preeclampsia.

Major risk factors that you can’t avoid include:

• Plaque. Plaque continues to build as you get older. The risk of CHD increases for men starting at age 45. It increases for women starting at age 55.
• Gender and race. Men are at higher risk than women. African Americans can be more likely to get CHD than other races.
• Family history

Ask your doctor for specific recommendations. They vary by person.","Treatment depends on age, health, degree of CHD, and other conditions. Mild or early cases of CHD may just need monitoring. Less invasive treatment options include:

• Medicine to relieve symptoms and reduce risk factors
• Eating healthy
• Losing weight
• Increased activity
• Stopping smoking
• Reducing stress

• Coronary artery bypass: Your surgeon will redirect the path to your heart. It will go around the blocked or narrowed areas. The new path will allow blood and oxygen to get through.
• Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): Your surgeon will insert and inflate a tiny balloon to fix your vessels. It will push back the plaque to allow blood and oxygen to pass through. They also might replace a part of your vessel. They can use tissue from another part of your body or a stent. This is a small tube-shaped medical device. It provides support to keep your arteries open.

There are different approaches for heart surgery. Minimally invasive involves small cuts in your chest, between your ribs. Open-heart requires a large cut in your chest to open your rib cage. Surgery can be done off-pump. This is where your heart beats on its own. Or, your surgeon can use a heart-lung bypass machine to pump for your heart.

Another type is cardiac rehabilitation. Your doctor can prescribe this instead of or in addition to surgery. Cardiac rehab focuses on education and exercise. It includes counseling to help you handle stress or emotions.","Finding coronary heart disease early can prevent it from getting worse. If left untreated, you could have a heart attack or get arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). CHD can lead to death. Proper diagnosis and treatment allows you to correct it with lifestyle changes and manage it with medicine or surgery. Surgery has various recovery timeframes.

Talk to your doctor about your specific outcomes and goals. You likely will need ongoing doctor visits and tests. CHD does increase your risk for a heart attack. Make sure you know the warning signs and when to call 911.","• How severe is my CHD?
• What can I do to prevent my disease from getting worse?
• What tests can I take to check for CHD?
• How do I know if I’m having a heart attack or stroke?
• If I’ve had one heart attack, am I at risk for a second one?","American Academy of Family Physicians, Clinical Recommendation for Coronary Heart Disease

96,Coronavirus (COVID-19),https://familydoctor.org/condition/coronavirus19/,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in 2019. Coronaviruses mutate (change) into new and different variants. However, they remain infectious to people and some animals. The infection spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and even talking.

SARS-CoV-2, like other virus mutations, behave and present","symptoms differently from the original virus strain. This includes the Delta, Omicron, and JN.1 variants. These variants can be transmitted between people more easily, produce different symptoms, and cause severe disease.

In early 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 remains a pandemic but is in a different phase. Additionally, many factors can impact COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. This includes poverty, physical environment (e.g., smoke exposure, unhoused), and race or ethnicity.

COVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. It takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Symptoms can differ slightly, based on the variant, but may include some or all of the following:

• Fever
• Cough
• Shortness of breath
• Chills
• Repeated shaking with chills
• Muscle pain or aches
• Headache
• Sore throat
• New loss of taste or smell
• Runny nose and/or congestion
• Nausea and vomiting
• Diarrhea

You may never develop symptoms after being exposed to COVID-19, which is referred to as being asymptomatic. But you can still spread the virus to others without symptoms.","The most common way to get COVID-19 is by inhaling respiratory droplets in the air. When a person with COVID-19 breathes, coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets leave their mouth and nose and go into the air. You can’t see these droplets. If you’re within 6 feet of that person, you may breathe in those droplets. You won’t know you’ve done it. But you may get the germs that cause COVID-19 in your body.

COVID-19 also can be shared if you touch a surface an infected person has touched. Some examples include door handles, elevator buttons and shopping carts. The germs can get into your body if you then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.","If you believe you have COVID-19, the first step is to get a test. You can test at home.

In general, testing availability may differ depending on where you live. There are some no-cost testing centers. Check your local health department to see what locations near you are doing testing and if there is a fee to test. This may include hospitals and pharmacies that offer drive-thru testing during high COVID-19 infection periods in your local community. This will allow you to stay in your car to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Depending on the location, someone may approach your car to collect a sample, or they may ask you to collect it yourself. Medical professionals collect samples for COVID-19 viral tests through nasal swabs. Depending on where you get your test, you may get your results the same day or you may have to wait a few days. If you test at home, be sure to follow the instructions to help insure accurate test results.","Getting the COVID-19 vaccine can protect you – and others around you – from getting very ill from COVID-19. Wearing well-fitting masks in public settings is very effective at preventing spread of the virus. While any mask will provide protection, people are encouraged to wear higher quality masks (KN95, Kf94, or N95) when possible. Even if you wear a mask, you should still avoid people who are sick or be cautious in large crowds. Stay home if you are sick, and talk with your doctor about getting tested. Cover your cough with a tissue, or cough into your upper sleeve or elbow. Do not cough into your hands.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.","As with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest. Symptoms of COVID-19 usually go away on their own. If symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor. They may prescribe pain or fever medication. If you are having trouble breathing, seek immediate medical care.

If you catch your symptoms early and test positive, talk to your doctor or health department about Paxlovid, a preferred anti-viral medication that reduces the severity of your symptoms, but does not eliminate the virus. Individuals covered under federal programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, and uninsured patients are eligible for the USG Patient Assistance Program (PAP) operated by Pfizer and can receive Paxlovid at no cost. Patients can enroll to participate.

There are certain eligibility requirements for receiving Paxlovid. A doctor or health department can tell you if you are eligible.

The FDA advises people to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. Additionally, do not take any form of chloroquine, ivermectin or other medicines unless your family doctor has prescribed them for you. There are a few options to treat COVID-19 for people at high risk of serious illness. Your physician will decide which option is appropriate for you.","Long COVID is a term for the wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems that occur after a COVID-19 infection. It may also be referred to as Post-COVID condition, long-haul COVID, and chronic COVID.

If you experience respiratory virus symptoms—such as fever, chills, fatigue, cough, runny nose, headache, or others—that can’t be attributed to another cause, remain at home and keep your distance from everyone, including healthy household members.

It’s also important to remember that even if you get a negative test, you may still need to self-isolate if you’ve been exposed to COVID-19. This is because it can take time after exposure for your sample to show a COVID-19 infection.

Once you resume your regular routine, exercise extra caution over the following five days. Consider measures like improving indoor air quality, maintaining good hygiene, wearing masks, keeping physical distance, and getting tested before spending time with others indoors. These steps are particularly crucial for safeguarding individuals who are at higher risk of severe respiratory illness.

A COVID-19 vaccine offers the best opportunity to reduce the spread of the virus and its symptoms or need for hospitalization. Vaccine recommendations are based on age, time since last dose, and in some cases, the first vaccine received.

Vaccines include Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, both of which are mRNA vaccines. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine which is a protein subunit vaccine. J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, a viral vector vaccine has expired and is no longer available for use in the United States as of May 6, 2023.

The AAFP and CDC recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for people 5 and older, and the Moderna vaccine for people 18 and older. To maximize protection, COVID-19 vaccine booster doses are now recommended for adults aged 12 and older. People 12-17 years old can only receive a booster dose of Pfizer.

In March 2023, the FDA authorized the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose for children 6 months through 4 years of age.

The CDC provides a guideline to vaccine availability and coverage to people who want the vaccine but do not have insurance.

Symptoms can come from the long-term effects of the viral infection, a long illness and hospitalization related to severe COVID-19 disease. They include difficulty breathing, fatigue, malaise, “brain fog” or cognitive impairment, cough, chest pain, headache, rash, impaired daily function, etc. View a complete list of symptoms and talk with your family doctor is you’re experiencing any symptoms after a COVID-19 infection.

If you had COVID-19 and were hospitalized or needed intensive care, your risk for having long COVID increases. There is also new evidence that repeated COVID-19 infections could increase the likelihood of developing long COVID. That is why it is important to get the vaccine. Even if you do get COVID-19, the vaccine will reduce your chances of getting severely ill.","• What can I do to prevent my friends and family from getting COVID-19?

If you experience respiratory virus symptoms—such as fever, chills, fatigue, cough, runny nose, headache, or others—that can’t be attributed to another cause, remain at home and keep your distance from everyone, including healthy household members.

It’s also important to remember that even if you get a negative test, you may still need to self-isolate if you’ve been exposed to COVID-19. This is because it can take time after exposure for your sample to show a COVID-19 infection.

Once you resume your regular routine, exercise extra caution over the following five days. Consider measures like improving indoor air quality, maintaining good hygiene, wearing masks, keeping physical distance, and getting tested before spending time with others indoors. These steps are particularly crucial for safeguarding individuals who are at higher risk of severe respiratory illness.

A COVID-19 vaccine offers the best opportunity to reduce the spread of the virus and its symptoms or need for hospitalization. Vaccine recommendations are based on age, time since last dose, and in some cases, the first vaccine received.

Vaccines include Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, both of which are mRNA vaccines. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine which is a protein subunit vaccine. J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, a viral vector vaccine has expired and is no longer available for use in the United States as of May 6, 2023.

The AAFP and CDC recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for people 5 and older, and the Moderna vaccine for people 18 and older. To maximize protection, COVID-19 vaccine booster doses are now recommended for adults aged 12 and older. People 12-17 years old can only receive a booster dose of Pfizer.

In March 2023, the FDA authorized the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose for children 6 months through 4 years of age.

The CDC provides a guideline to vaccine availability and coverage to people who want the vaccine but do not have insurance.

There is a lot of misinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccine, so be sure you are getting your information and recommendations from a reputable organization or from your family doctor.

Top 10 Tips From Your Family Doctor"
98,Crohn’s Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/crohns-disease/,"Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes ulcers to form in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Crohn’s disease can have “skip” areas that are normal. These normal areas lie in between areas that are affected. Some people who have Crohn’s disease have severe symptoms. Others have symptoms that are not as severe. Some people who have the disease have long periods without symptoms, even without getting treatment. Others who have more severe symptoms will need long-term treatment or even surgery.","The symptoms of Crohn’s disease vary, depending on which part or parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is/are affected. Common symptoms include:

• Diarrhea
• Stomach cramps
• Abdominal pain that comes and goes
• Blood in your stool
• Low appetite
• Unintended weight loss

Other less common symptoms may include

• Fever
• Joint pain
• Eye problems
• Skin problems
• Feeling tired (called fatigue)

Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can come and go. Symptoms can start suddenly or gradually.","Doctors don’t yet know exactly what causes Crohn’s disease. It seems to run in families, which means that genetics play a role. Many researchers believe that a problem with the immune system causes inflammatory bowel diseases. Normally, the immune system protects your body from infection. In people who have an inflammatory bowel disease, the immune system mistakes food, healthy bacteria, and other substances for an infection. This causes the immune system to attack the cells of the intestine, which leads to inflammation.","Your doctor will give you a physical exam and listen to you describe your symptoms. To help diagnose the problem, your doctor may order a number of tests, including blood tests and stool samples. Additionally, your doctor may order one or more procedures to help them view your colon. For example, lower GI endoscopy procedures include colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy. During these procedures, your doctor uses a narrow, flexible tube to look directly inside your large intestine. Upper GI endoscopy allows a look at your stomach and small intestine for ulcers. For this type of endoscopy, you may swallow a small camera (called capsule endoscopy). If not, your doctor inserts a scope into your GI tract through your mouth.

Your doctor may also order other imaging tests such as X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI.","Crohn’s disease cannot be prevented, but you can make lifestyle changes to minimize symptoms. The best thing you can do is to take good care of yourself. It’s important to eat a healthy diet. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may ask you to reduce the amount of fiber or dairy products in your diet. It also may be necessary to limit or avoid caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages. In addition to eating well, you need to get enough rest and exercise regularly. It’s also important that you learn to manage the stress in your life. When you become overly upset by things that happen at home or at work, your intestinal problems can get worse.","The goal of treatment is to get rid of the inflammation that causes your symptoms. Many types of medicine can help reduce inflammation. Talk to your doctor about anti-inflammatory drugs and drugs that suppress the immune system. Some medicines are needed only during flare-ups, however, you may need long-term medicines to suppress your immune system. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also recommend these medicines and supplements:

• Antibiotic
• Anti-diarrheal
• Anti-inflammatory (aminosalicylates)
• Corticosteroid (steroid)
• Laxative
• Pain reliever
• Vitamin supplements

In severe cases of Crohn’s disease, you may need to go to the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids or surgery.

A team of doctors will most likely oversee your treatment. This team may include your family physician, a gastroenterologist (a specialist in stomach and intestinal disorders), and, possibly, a surgeon.","If you have inflammatory bowel disease, you are at an increased risk for colon cancer. Therefore, it’s important to talk to your doctor about when to start screening for colon cancer and how often to have screening.

Crohn’s disease can keep coming back, and its symptoms can be unpredictable. This cycle can cause patients who have these illnesses to become depressed. If you feel depressed, talk with your family doctor. They may be able to prescribe an antidepressant medicine could help you feel better.

How can I get more information?

You can understand and manage your illness better if you are informed. So be sure to ask questions and read about IBD. You can also discuss treatments with your doctor. Finally, consider joining a patient support group, especially if you have severe symptoms.","• How will my Crohn’s disease be treated?
• Will I need surgery? Are there other options?
• What lifestyle changes can I make to help Crohn’s disease?
• What are some medicines used to treat Crohn’s disease and what are the possible side effects?
• Are my children at risk of getting Crohn’s disease?","Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America

99,Croup,https://familydoctor.org/condition/croup/,"Croup is a common childhood infection that affects breathing. It is recognizable by a “barking” cough commonly referred to as croup cough. It is caused by a virus and is common during winter and spring months. It usually affects children age 5 and younger, but older children can contract it as well.

The “barking” cough associated with croup is caused by inflammation of the upper trachea as a result of the virus.","In addition to the barking cough, your child may have a fever and a high-pitched noise as they breathe in (stridor). Another sign that it may be croup is that the cough is worse at night. Your child may have these symptoms for 3 to 5 days.",The most common cause of croup is an infection from the human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs). HPIVs are a group of 4 viruses. The viruses are airborne and can spread from an infected person’s cough or sneeze. The virus also spreads from hand to mouth when your child touches a contaminated surface or item and then puts his or her hand into their mouth or nose.,"Your doctor will examine your child’s breathing and listen with a stethoscope. Also, he will look at the inside of your child’s throat and ask about any recent history of illness. A chest X-ray may be required to rule out other reasons for the cough.","Good and frequent hand washing is the best way to prevent the virus that causes croup. Additionally, don’t allow your child to share cups, plates, and utensils with others. If you know someone with croup, avoid contact with that person. If your child has croup (or has been diagnosed with a respiratory virus), keep your child home from school and play dates.","Your doctor may prescribe a steroid to help with the trachea inflammation caused by croup. In more severe cases, doctors may prescribe certain breathing treatments. However, most cases of croup can be treated at home. Your child will need more fluids than normal when battling croup. You can help your child breathe easier by exposing him or her to moist air. This can be done with a warm, steamy room (let the shower run in a bathroom with the door closed) or a mist humidifier. Cool air also helps. You can take your child outside in the winter months for a few minutes for cool air.

Also, try having your child breathe through a warm, wet washcloth for a few minutes to help them breathe. If your child is coughing for long periods, he or she may have chest pain. Over-the-counter children’s pain medicine can help ease the pain. Do not give your child aspirin. Call 911 immediately if your child:

• Stops breathing or is having great difficulty breathing.
• Has excessive drooling and difficulty swallowing.
• Starts to turn blue around their fingernails, mouth, or nose.
• Starts to act extremely sluggish and weak.","Caring for a child with croup can be tiring. Since the coughing occurs more frequently at night, you may have to get up with your child several times a night to give them relief. The sound of their coughing also can interrupt the sleep of others in the house. Be prepared for your child to be irritable. The coughing is uncomfortable and interrupts their sleep.","• How long is my child contagious once I hear the barking cough?
• Can you build up immunity to the virus that causes croup?
• Can an antibiotic treat the virus that causes croup?
• Can untreated croup cause your child to stop breathing?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Croup

100,Cushing's Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cushings-syndrome/,"Cushing’s syndrome is a disease that occurs when your body makes too much of the hormone cortisol. Also, it can occur from getting too much cortisol from medicines.

A little cortisol is acceptable. Prolonged exposure to the hormone causes problems. Cortisol is produced by the outer area of your adrenal glands. These glands are located above each kidney. Cortisol is good for your body in limited amounts. In fact, cortisol is sometimes called a “stress hormone.” This is because it helps the body respond to stress. Also, it helps your body use nutrients, treat inflammation, control the amount of water in your body, and tell your liver when to increase your blood sugar as it needs it.

Cortisol is controlled by another hormone known as ACTH. It is made in your pituitary gland. This gland is located just below your brain.","The following are some of the symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome:

• Fat deposits that form around the abdomen and upper back (a hump often forms between the shoulders)
• Thinner skin that is easily bruised
• Cuts, scratches, and insect bites that take a long time to heal
• Pink or purple stretch marks on your skin (especially the arms, breasts, abdomen, and thighs)
• Fatigue
• Round and puffy face
• Muscle weakness
• Depression
• Irritability
• Irregular menstrual periods in women
• Thicker or more visible hair on the face and body (usually more noticeable in women)
• Erectile dysfunction in men
• High blood pressure
• Osteoporosis (weak and brittle bones)
• High blood sugar levels","The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is taking corticosteroid medicines (in pill form) every day for weeks to months. These medicines are usually used to treat inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Inhaled steroid medicines for asthma and steroid skin creams don’t usually cause Cushing’s syndrome. These forms are used for eczema and other skin conditions. Even pills taken every day for short periods of time or every other day for longer periods don’t often cause Cushing’s syndrome.

The next most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is when the body makes too much cortisol. It may be one adrenal gland producing too much cortisol, or it may be both adrenal glands. This overproduction could be triggered by a tumor on the pituitary gland. Pituitary gland tumors causing Cushing’s syndrome aren’t usually malignant (cancerous). However, if these tumors get too big, they can cause problems with your eyesight.

Cushing’s syndrome also can be caused by other tumors in your body. Ectopic ACTH-producing tumors can be malignant or benign (not cancerous). They release too much of the hormone ACTH. This tells your body to produce more cortisol. Not much is known about what causes the tumors. If your body isn’t getting enough ACTH, your cortisol levels will decrease. As this happens, it shrinks your adrenal glands. This can lead to another disease called Addison’s disease.

A primary adrenal gland disease or disorder can also cause Cushing’s syndrome. With this type of disorder, your glands make too much or too little cortisol. This production of cortisol is not in response to ACTH.","Your doctor may start by asking you questions about your medical history. They also may do a physical exam. If the cause is a medicine you’re taking, no tests are usually needed. If your doctor thinks you have Cushing’s syndrome and you’re not taking medicines that cause it, you may need to have blood and urine tests. These tests measure the amount of cortisol in your body.

You may be asked to collect your urine for 24 hours. You also may be given a certain medicine before your blood or urine is collected. This tests your body’s response to steroids. You also may be asked to collect your saliva late in the evening. How much cortisol is in the saliva can help your doctor determine if you have Cushing’s syndrome.

You may need a computerized tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These tests take a picture of your insides. Looking at these pictures, your doctor will be able to tell whether there are tumors on the pituitary gland or in other parts of your body that may be causing Cushing’s syndrome.","If your doctor plans to treat any of your health issues with steroid medicines, talk with them first. Discuss how long you will have to take the steroids. Ask them if there’s a possibility it will cause Cushing’s syndrome. There is no way of preventing pituitary gland tumors.","If a corticosteroid medicine is causing Cushing’s syndrome, your doctor will gradually lower your dose. Abruptly stopping a corticosteroid can cause a dangerous drop in your cortisol levels. Never stop taking these medicines without your doctor’s approval. Your doctor also may prescribe a noncorticosteroid medicine to replace the corticosteroid that was causing Cushing’s syndrome.

If a tumor is causing Cushing’s syndrome, sometimes a medication can be used to treat it. If not, your doctor will surgically remove it from your pituitary gland. This type of surgery is usually successful. Radiation treatments are sometimes used after surgery to lower the risk the tumor will return. You’ll need to take a cortisol replacement medicine after the tumor is removed. This is because it will take your body some time before it starts producing normal amounts of cortisol. Most people only need to take the cortisol replacement medicine for a few months. However, it could take up to year.","Cushing’s syndrome treatment does not always return people to the same level of health they once had. Their bones may not be as strong. People who no longer have Cushing’s syndrome are at higher risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. A person cured of Cushing’s syndrome might have some memory loss and slight mental decline. But the change is slight. In rare cases, people who have had surgery to remove a tumor that was causing Cushing’s syndrome never regain normal cortisol levels and must therefore continue to take the cortisol replacement medicine.

Once you’ve been diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome and treated, you will need regular checkups for the rest of your life. In rare cases, surgery to remove a tumor may miss some of the tumor and it may grow again.","• What risks are associated with surgery?
• When can I expect relief from my symptoms?
• How much stress is too much stress to cause increased cortisol levels?
• Are pituitary gland tumors genetic?","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Cushing’s Syndrome

102,Cytomegalovirus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/cytomegalovirus/,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus. Most people are exposed to the virus as infants. It is that believed most adults are diagnosed with the virus by age 40. Many people are infected with CMV and don’t know it. That’s because the virus rarely causes symptoms. It usually does not cause long-term problems. However, CMV can cause problems in people who have a weakened immune system. Also, it can cause problems in a newborn if the mother gets the infection during pregnancy.","Usually, CMV does not cause symptoms. Sometimes, it causes mild symptoms. A few people will have symptoms that are similar to the mononucleosis virus. Symptoms of CMV can include:

• sore throat
• swollen lymph nodes
• fever
• headache
• fatigue
• weakness
• muscle aches
• loss of appetite

Newborns infected with CMV while in the womb can be very sick when they are born. Symptoms at birth can include:

• jaundice (yellowing of the skin)
• low birth weight
• seizures
• enlarged spleen
• enlarged liver
• pneumonia

People taking immunosuppressant medicines for conditions like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or from having an organ transplant may have severe symptoms. Immunosuppressant medicines lower or suppress the immune system. Symptoms of severe CMV include:

• blindness
• pneumonitis (inflammation of the respiratory tract)
• diarrhea
• bleeding ulcers in the esophagus (windpipe) or intestines (stomach region)
• inflammation of the brain
• seizures

CMV is likely to cause vision problems in people who have weakened immune systems. So if you have certain conditions, such as HIV or AIDS, your doctor may recommend that you visit an eye doctor to check for infection. Let your doctor know if you are having painless, blurry vision (floaters) in one eye, light flashes, or areas of blindness. Also tell your doctor if you are experiencing frequent shortness of breath with flu-like symptoms, or if you are having problems hearing.","The virus is similar to the viruses that cause chickenpox and mononucleosis. It gets into body fluids, such as saliva, blood, urine, semen, and breast milk. A person can pass the virus onto others when it is active in his or her system. It spreads from one person to another through sexual contact or contact with blood and other body fluids. CMV is rarely spread by blood transfusion or organ transplantation.

If a pregnant woman passes CMV onto her unborn baby, it could cause a miscarriage, stillbirth, or death of the newborn. Newborns who survive are at an increased risk for hearing loss and mental disability. However, only a small percentage of newborns infected with CMV during pregnancy experience problems from the virus. Most are born healthy or with only mild CMV symptoms.","CMV is diagnosed with a blood test. If you are pregnant, your doctor may want to test you for CMV. If you do carry the virus, your doctor may suggest a test called amniocentesis. During this test, a needle is inserted into the mother’s uterus to collect a sample of fluid surrounding the baby. The fluid will be sent to a lab for testing.","Careful, frequent hand washing with soap and water may help prevent the spread of CMV. Daycare centers are high-risk areas for children 1 to 3 years of age. People caring for someone diagnosed with HIV, AIDS, or with weakened immune systems from organ transplant should wear gloves when dealing with bodily fluids. Avoid kissing and sexual contact with a known infected person. Always practice safe sex by using condoms.","For otherwise healthy people, CMV usually doesn’t require treatment. If your immune system is weakened, your doctor may use a medicine to treat CMV. However, because CMV is a virus, regular antibiotics won’t work. Antiviral drugs are usually prescribed. This slows the virus. However, it cannot cure CMV.

If you are pregnant and your baby has CMV, you doctor will likely check your baby for any health problems once he or she is born so they can be treated early. Treatable symptoms in newborns include pneumonia, hearing loss, and inflammation of the eye.","When the virus is inactive (no signs of symptoms), there is no discomfort. When the virus is active, the symptoms can affect your quality of life. See your doctor for recommendations on ways reduce the discomfort of the symptoms.","• Are there any activities I should restrict while I’m sick?
• How long should I keep my child home from school?
• How long will I be contagious?
• I have HIV. Do I need any special treatments?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Congenital CMV Infection

103,De Quervain’s Tenosynovitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/de-quervains-tenosynovitis/,"De Quervain’s tenosynovitis is a painful condition that affects the tendons in your wrist. It occurs when the 2 tendons around the base of your thumb become swollen. The swelling causes the sheaths (casings) covering the tendons to become inflamed. This puts pressure on nearby nerves, causing pain and numbness.","The main symptom of de Quervain’s tenosynovitis is pain or tenderness at the base of your thumb. You might also feel pain going up your forearm. The pain may develop slowly or come on suddenly. It may get worse when you use your hand, thumb, or wrist.

• Swelling near the base of your thumb
• Numbness along the back of your thumb and index finger
• A “catching” or “snapping” feeling when you move your thumb
• A squeaking sound as the tendons move within the swollen sheaths.","The most common cause of de Quervain’s tenosynovitis is chronic overuse of the wrist. Repetitive movements day after day cause irritation and pain. One common movement that causes it is lifting a child into a car seat. Another is lifting heavy grocery bags by the handles. Other causes could include a direct injury to the wrist or inflammatory arthritis.

You are more likely to develop de Quervain’s tenosynovitis if:

• You are a woman
• You are 40 years of age or older
• Your hobby or job involves repetitive hand and wrist motions. This is a very common cause
• You have injured your wrist. Scar tissue can restrict the movement of your tendons
• You are pregnant. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause it.
• You have arthritis.","To diagnose de Quervain’s tenosynovitis, your doctor may do a simple test. It is called the Finkelstein test. First, you bend your thumb so it rests across your palm. Then you make a fist, closing your fingers over your thumb. Last, you bend your wrist toward your little finger. If you have tenderness or pain at the base of your thumb, you probably have de Quervain’s tenosynovitis.

Other tests such as X-rays usually aren’t needed to diagnose the condition.","The best way to prevent de Quervain’s tenosynovitis is by avoiding repetitive movements. Change your actions to reduce the stress on your wrists. Take frequent breaks to rest if you are using your wrists. Wear a brace or splint on your thumb and wrist, if necessary. Follow the exercise routine suggested by your doctor or physical therapist. Be sure to tell them about any activities that cause pain, numbness, or swelling.","Treatment for de Quervain’s tenosynovitis focuses on reducing pain and swelling. It includes:

• Applying heat or ice to the affected area
• Taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve)
• Avoiding activities that cause pain and swelling. Especially avoid those that involve repetitive hand and wrist motions.
• Wearing a splint 24 hours a day for 4 to 6 weeks to rest your thumb and wrist
• Getting injections of steroids or a local anesthetic (numbing medicine) into the tendon sheath. These injections are very effective and are used regularly.

A physical therapist or occupational therapist can show you how to change the way you move. This can reduce stress on your wrist. They can also teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles.

Most people notice improvement after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment. They are able to use their hands and wrists without pain once the swelling is gone.

You might need surgery if your case is severe or if other treatments don’t relieve your pain. During outpatient surgery, the surgeon makes a small cut in the sheath around the swollen tendons. This provides more room for the tendons to move.

After surgery, you will need to do physical therapy to strengthen your wrist and thumb. This will help keep the problem from coming back. Once the area has healed and returned to full strength, you should have normal use of your hand.","De Quervain’s tenosynovitis is a temporary condition. It generally responds well to treatment. It is important to treat de Quervain’s tenosynovitis. If this condition isn’t treated, it can permanently limit your movement or cause the tendon sheath to burst. Once your symptoms are better, work to prevent the condition from happening again.","• What is the likely cause of my pain?
• What is the best treatment option for me?
• How long before I can expect relief from my symptoms?
• When can I return to my activity (job, sport, etc.)?
• Is it possible that my symptoms could return?
• What kind of exercises should I do to strengthen my thumb?
• What happens if the tendon sheath bursts?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: De Quervain tenosynovitis

104,Deep Vein Thrombosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/deep-vein-thrombosis/,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot. These clots usually occur deep down in your leg veins. DVT is common and can be dangerous. If the blood clot breaks off and travels through your bloodstream, it can block a blood vessel in your lungs. This blockage (called a pulmonary embolism) can be fatal.","Some people who have DVT do not have any symptoms. Most have some swelling in one or both legs. Often, there is pain or tenderness in one leg (may happen only when you stand or walk). Your skin may feel warm or look red or discolored. If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away.","Often, there are multiple factors that cause DVT. Your risk for DVT increases if you have several risk factors at the same time. You are at higher risk for DVT if you:

• Are 60 years of age or older.
• Are inactive for a long period of time, such as when you are flying in an airplane, taking a long car trip, or recovering in bed after surgery.
• Have a condition that causes increased blood clotting.
• Have an injury or surgery that reduces blood flow to a body part.
• Have a central venous catheter.
• Are pregnant or have recently given birth.
• Are overweight or have obesity
• Have varicose veins or vasculitis.
• Have cancer.
• Are a smoker.
• Take birth control pills or receive hormone therapy, including for postmenopausal symptoms.",Visit your doctor if you think you might have DVT. They will review your symptoms and health history and do a physical exam. They may order tests to help diagnose it. An ultrasound is the most common test. It uses sound waves to check the blood flow in your veins. A venography also can be done to find blood clots. A doctor injects dye into your veins and then takes an X-ray to check your blood flow.,"There are several things you can do to help prevent DVT. These are more important if you are at increased risk.

• Get frequent exercise. If you are inactive for a long period of time, move your legs around. Get up every hour or so and walk around, if you can. If you must stay seated, do lower leg exercises. With your feet flat on the ground, alternate lifting your heels and toes. This stretches your calves and keeps up your blood flow.
• Stretch your legs and lightly massage your muscles.
• Get out of bed and move around as soon as you can after being ill or having surgery.
• Control your blood pressure.
• Do not smoke.
• Lose weight if you are overweight.","The main goals of DVT treatment are to:

• Stop the clot from getting bigger.
• Prevent the clot from breaking off and traveling to your lungs.
• Prevent future blood clots.

Several medicines are used to treat and prevent DVT. Common ones include warfarin or heparin. These thin your blood so that clots won’t form. Warfarin is taken as a pill and heparin is given intravenously (in your veins). Warfarin can cause birth defects. Women who are pregnant should not take warfarin. If you can’t take heparin, your doctor may prescribe another type called a thrombin inhibitor. Newer treatment programs recommend NOACs (novel oral anticoagulants) as preferable medicines in most settings. Brand names include Eliquis, Pradaxa, and Xarelto.

Anticoagulants can cause you to bleed more easily. For example, you might notice that your blood takes longer to clot when you cut yourself. You may bruise more easily as well. If you have any unusual or heavy bleeding, call your doctor right away.

Some other medicines can affect how well an anticoagulant works. Talk to your doctor before you take any new medicine. This includes over-the-counter medicines and vitamins. Certain foods rich in vitamin K, such as dark green vegetables, also can have an effect.

There are other treatment options if you can’t take medicine to thin your blood, or if a blood thinner doesn’t work. Your doctor may suggest putting a filter in your vena cava. This is the main vein that carries blood from your lower body to your heart. This filter can catch a clot as it moves through your bloodstream and prevent it from reaching your lungs. This treatment is more common for people who have had several blood clots travel to their lungs.","It is important to start treatment right away for DVT. It takes about 3 to 6 months for a blood clot to go away. During this time, there are things you can do to relieve symptoms. Elevate your leg to reduce swelling. Talk to your doctor about using compression stockings. These cover the arch of your foot up to your knee. They create pressure on your leg to reduce swelling and relieve pain.

For some people, the clot may never fully dissolve. This can cause scar tissue in your veins. DVT also can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome. People who get this have chronic (long-term) swelling and pain.

If you have DVT and experience the following symptoms, get help right away. These are signs that the clot may have traveled to your lungs. You could be having a pulmonary embolism.

• shortness of breath
• chest pain
• dizziness
• fainting
• rapid heart rate
• coughing blood","• What is the likely cause of my DVT?

105,Dementia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/dementia/,"Dementia isn’t a disease. It’s a group of symptoms that can be caused by changes in brain structure. Dementia often occurs in older people. However, it’s not related to normal aging. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia.

Dementia makes it hard for people to remember, learn, and communicate. It may cause changes in mood and personality, such as depression. Early on, memory lapses and foggy thinking may bother someone who has dementia. Later, disruptive behavior and other problems can create a burden for caregivers and family. Over time, these changes make it hard for people who have dementia to care for themselves.","Symptoms of dementia may appear over time or all at once. Sometimes you may notice the symptoms in yourself. Sometimes those around you may notice them first. Either way, if you have two or more of the symptoms listed below, visit your doctor right away.

• Recent memory loss. It’s common to forget things for a while and remember them later. People who have dementia often forget things, but never remember them. They may cook a meal but forget to serve it. They might even forget that they cooked it.
• Difficulty performing familiar tasks. People who have dementia may struggle with simple things, like getting dressed. They may wake up and get dressed, then hours later get dressed again. They may forget how to tie their shoes or that milk needs to be refrigerated.
• Problems with language. People who have dementia may forget simple words or use the wrong words. This makes it hard for them to communicate and hard for others to know what they need.
• Time and place.People who have dementia may get lost on their own street. They may forget how they got to a certain place or how to get back home.
• Being absent-minded. Everyone gets distracted at times. People who have dementia can forget simple things. Examples are not putting on a coat before going outside when it’s cold or not using an umbrella when it rains.
• Problems with abstract thinking. Anyone can have trouble balancing a checkbook. People who have dementia may forget what the numbers are and what to do with them.
• Misplacing things. People who have dementia may put things in unusual places. They might put an iron in the freezer or a wristwatch in the refrigerator. When they can’t find the things, they may get upset or accuse others of stealing.
• Personality changes. People who have dementia may have drastic changes in personality. They might become irritable, suspicious, fearful, or depressed.
• Changes in mood. Everyone is moody at times, but people who have dementia can have sudden mood swings. They may go from calm to tears to anger in a few minutes.
• Loss of initiative.People who have dementia may become passive. They might not want to go places or see other people.","Dementia is caused by the damage of brain cells. A brain disease, such as Alzheimer’s, could trigger dementia. A brain tumor, head injury, or stroke could cause dementia.

Dementia isn’t the same as normal aging. As you get older, it becomes harder to recall information. Your short- and long-term and remote memories are less affected by aging. Your recent memory is more affected. For example, you may forget what you ate for breakfast or where you set your keys. These are normal changes.

A memory problem is serious when it affects your daily life. Memory problems that aren’t part of normal aging include:

• Forgetting things more often than you used to
• Forgetting how to do things you’ve done many times before
• Trouble learning new things
• Repeating phrases or stories in the same conversation
• Trouble making choices or handling money
• Not being able to keep track of what happens each day

Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have. They can decide if a medicine or condition may be affecting your memory.

When a loved one has dementia, your family doctor can be a trusted resource and partner in their care. Read More","Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They can do tests to find out if dementia is the cause of your symptoms. The sooner you do this, the sooner you can talk about treatment options.

If your family member shows signs, try to get them to see a doctor. You may want to go to the visit with them. This lets you speak with the doctor in private. You can tell them how your loved one is acting and learn about treatment.","There is little you can do to prevent or avoid dementia. If you have a head injury or brain tumor, ask your doctor if there are lifestyle changes you can make. You’ll want to take precautions to avoid additional head trauma or concussions. If you’re at risk of stroke, talk to your doctor about possible preventions.

Currently, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) concludes that the current science doesn’t clearly demonstrate if screening for cognitive impairments has more benefit that harm.","Some causes of dementia can be treated. However, once brain cells have been destroyed, they can’t be replaced. Treatment may slow or stop more brain cell damage. When the cause of dementia can’t be treated, the focus of care is on helping the person with their daily activities and reducing symptoms. Some medicines can help slow down the progression of dementia. Your family doctor will talk with you about treatment options.","There is no cure for dementia. People who have dementia should learn how to manage symptoms. Dementia is hard for the people who have it, as well as the people who love them. It’s important for family to learn about the condition and help their loved one. This may include visiting more, helping out, hiring medical care, or switching residences.

People who have dementia may become agitated for various reasons. Examples are frustrating or stressful situations, or a sudden change in surroundings. Simple things such as getting dressed or not remembering can lead to frustration. It’s possible that a person who is irritable may try to hurt themselves or others. Try to avoid things or places in which your loved one might become frustrated. Try to make your loved one’s tasks less difficult. You also can try to limit the number of difficult situations your loved one must face. For example, if taking a daily bath or shower causes problems, have him or he take one every other day. Or schedule difficult tasks for a time of day when your loved one tends to be less agitated. It’s helpful to give frequent reassurance and avoid challenging them.

Some people who have dementia may have hallucinations. These can be scary or upsetting. Try to distract the person by involving them in a pleasant activity. It’s best not to argue or fight with them when they’re hallucinating. You don’t want to agitate them more.

If your loved one is having trouble sleeping, try the following:

• Make the person aware of what time of day it is. Place clocks where they can easily see them.
• Keep curtains or blinds open so they can tell if it’s daytime or nighttime.
• Limit the amount of caffeine they consume.
• Try to help them exercise every day.
• Don’t let them take too many naps during the day.
• Make their bedroom peaceful. It’s easier to sleep in a quiet room.
• At night, provide a nightlight or leave a dim light on. Total darkness can add to confusion.
• Ask the doctor about medicine to treat pain, such as for arthritis. Some conditions can interrupt a person’s sleep.

If your loved one is prone to wandering, try these solutions:

• Allow them to wander in a safe place, such as a fenced yard.
• Tell them not to leave the house by themselves. You can put a large stop sign on the door as a reminder.
• Install an alarm system that will sound when the door opens. You can set it so you’re alerted when this happens.
• Place special locks on the doors. Don’t use this method if your loved one is left home alone.
• Get a medical bracelet for them to wear. Include their name, address, medical conditions, and your phone number.
• Check in with them frequently by telephone and/or in person.","• Does dementia run in families? Am I at risk?
• What types of medicines treat dementia? Are there any side effects?
• Are there any lifestyle changes that help improve the symptoms of dementia?
• Can you recommend a support group for people who have dementia and their families?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: What Is Dementia?

106,Depression,https://familydoctor.org/condition/depression/,"Depression is a serious medical illness of the brain. It is not a feeling of sadness or feeling “blue.” Someone who has depression has symptoms nearly every day, all day, for 2 weeks or longer. It’s persistent and interferes with everyday life—from work, home, and school to relationships and daily tasks. For some, depression can lead to suicidal thoughts. If you or a loved one are having suicidal thoughts, call or text 988. This is the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It is staffed around the clock. Your call or text will never be turned away.

Depression can affect people of all ages and is different for every person. A person who has depression can’t control their feelings. If you or your child, teen, or older relative is depressed, it’s not their fault. Left untreated, depression can last for weeks, months, or even years.

Women are twice as likely as men to experience depression. The reason for this is unknown. Changes in a woman’s hormone levels may be related to depression.","Symptoms are different for every person. You may have one or many of the symptoms listed below. Your symptoms may appear as emotional, physical, or a combination of both. The symptoms of depression may be different for children, teens, and seniors.

• Crying easily or for no reason
• Feeling guilty or worthless
• Feeling restless, irritated, and easily annoyed
• Feeling “empty,” numb, or hopeless
• Losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy (including sex)
• Thinking about death or suicide.

• Changes in appetite (eating more than usual or eating less and experiencing unplanned weight loss)
• Feeling extremely tired all the time
• Having other aches and pains that don’t get better with treatment
• Having trouble paying attention, recalling things, concentrating, and making decisions
• Headaches, backaches, or digestive problems
• Sleeping too much or having trouble sleeping","Depression is typically caused by one or more factors. This includes genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological causes.

For example, depression may be caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. Sometimes there aren’t enough chemical messengers (called neurotransmitters) in the brain. Neurotransmitters that affect your mood are serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. A chemical imbalance in the brain may be caused by one or more of the following:

• Your genes.Sometimes depression is hereditary. This means it runs in your family. You may be more at risk for having depression if you have a parent or sibling who has depression.
• A medical condition. Problems with your thyroid or nutrient deficiencies may be associated with an increased risk of depression. Sometimes, people experience depression after cardiac surgery. Depression also is a symptom of bipolar disorder.
• Events in your life.Situational depression can be triggered by stressful events in your life. These can include the death of someone you love, a divorce, chronic illness, or loss of a job.
• Medicines, drugs, or alcohol. Taking certain medicines, abusing drugs or alcohol, or having other illnesses can also lead to depression.
• Some people have seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in the winter, due to the reduction in sunlight and colder temperatures.
• Chronic disease. Living with a chronic disease, such as diabetes or obesity, can cause a person to be depressed. This is because the person feels they aren’t in control of their health outcomes or because their lifestyles are restricted.

Depression is not caused by personal weakness, laziness, or lack of willpower.

In the days following the birth of a baby, it is common for some mothers to have mood swings. They may feel a little depressed or have a hard time concentrating. They may lose their appetite or find that they can’t sleep well even when the baby is asleep. This is called the baby blues and goes away within 10 days after delivery. However, some women have worse symptoms or symptoms that last longer. This is called postpartum depression.","Tell your doctor about your symptoms. Don’t expect your doctor to guess that you’re depressed just by looking at you. You may feel embarrassed. It may be hard for you to imagine that treatment will help you feel better. But don’t wait to talk to your doctor. The sooner you seek treatment, the sooner the depression will lift.

Once you tell your doctor how you’re feeling, they may ask you some questions about your symptoms, your health, and your family history. Your doctor may also give you a physical exam and do some tests. It is important to tell your doctor about any medicines that you are taking, including substance abuse.

• Early diagnosis and treatment reduce the risk that depression will get worse or last a long time.
• Diagnosis and treatment can help you return to your “normal” self and enjoy life.
• Treatment can help prevent depression from returning.
• Thoughts of suicide are common in people with major depression. The risk of suicide is higher the longer you wait to treat it.","Generally, depression is a condition that cannot be prevented. There are lifestyle changes you can make that can boost your mood and minimize symptoms of depression (see depression treatment).","Depression can be treated with prescription antidepressant medicines, counseling, or a combination of the two. Lifestyle changes can help, too. This includes a nutritious diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, drugs, and too much caffeine. Research has shown that fueling your body with healthy foods can fuel your brain.

Depression usually can be treated through visits to your doctor. You may need in-hospital treatment if you have other medical conditions that could affect your treatment. In-hospital treatment is required if you’re at high risk of suicide.","The most important part of living with depression is not giving up. Stay focused on your goal to feel better and be consistent with your doctor-recommended treatment. Do not try to “self-medicate” for depression with substance use. It only makes it worse.

Consider these dos and don’ts as you work toward recovery.","• I’ve been feeling _____. Could I be depressed?
• Do I need treatment? What are my treatment options?
• Should I see a therapist?
• Is there anything I can do at home to help myself?
• Are there support groups in my area?
• If I’m pregnant or breastfeeding, can I take antidepressants?
• Will I feel this way the rest of my life?
• Will I have to take medicine the rest of my life?
• How can I tell if a loved one is depressed?
• Does dementia increase depression?
• What should I do if I am having thoughts of suicide?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Depression

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Your doctor may prescribe medicine to treat your depression. These are called antidepressants. They help increase the number of chemical messengers (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) in your brain.

Antidepressants work differently for different people. They also have different side effects. So, even if one medicine bothers you or doesn’t work for you, another may help. You may notice improvement as soon as 1 week after you start taking the medicine. But you probably won’t see the full effects for about 8 to 12 weeks. You may have side effects at first. They tend to decrease after a couple of weeks. Don’t stop taking the medicine without checking with your doctor first.

There is some new research that ketamine therapy may have a rapid effect on improving severe depression.

Counseling (or talk therapy) may be a good treatment option for mild to moderate depression. For major depression and for some people with minor depression, counseling may not be enough. A combination of medicine and talk therapy is usually the most effective way of treating more severe depression. If you continue the combination treatment for at least a year, you are less likely to have depression come back.

In psychotherapy, you talk with a trained therapist or counselor about things that are going on in your life. The focus may be on your thoughts and beliefs, on things that happened in your past, or on your relationships. Or the focus may be on your behavior, how it’s affecting you, and what you can do differently.

In more serious cases, your doctor may suggest the use of electroconvulsive therapy (also called ECT or electroshock therapy). It changes your brain’s chemistry. Electric currents are passed through the brain to trigger a seizure (a short period of irregular brain activity). It lasts about 40 seconds. Medicine is given during ECT to prevent damage to muscles and bones.

Electroconvulsive therapy may help people who have the following conditions:

• Severe depression that does not respond to antidepressants (medicines used to treat depression) or counseling
• Severe depression in patients who can’t take antidepressants
• Severe mania that does not respond to medicine. Symptoms of severe mania may include agitation, confusion, hallucinations, or delusions.
• Schizophrenia that does not respond to medicine

• Pace yourself
• Get involved in activities that make you feel good or feel like you’ve achieved something. This includes volunteering or joining a club.
• Avoid drugs and alcohol. Both make depression worse. Both can cause dangerous side effects with antidepressant medicines.
• Exercise regularly. It makes your body feel better. Exercise causes a chemical reaction in the body that can boost your mood. Your goal should be exercising 4 to 6 times a week for at least 30 minutes each time.
• Eat balanced meals and healthy foods. Avoid junk food and processed food.
• Get plenty of sleep. Keep your sleep routine consistent (waking up and going to bed at the same time each day).
• Take your medicine and/or go to counseling as often as your doctor recommends. Your medicine won’t work if you only take it occasionally.
• Set small goals for yourself if you have low energy.
• Encourage yourself.
• Get as much information as you can about depression and how to treat it.
• Call your doctor or the local suicide crisis center right away if you have thoughts of suicide.

• Don’t isolate yourself. Stay in touch with friends, family, your spiritual advisor, and your doctor.
• Don’t let negative thoughts linger in your mind. Don’t talk badly about yourself. Don’t expect to fail. This type of thinking is typical of depression. These thoughts will go away as your depression lifts.
• Don’t blame yourself for your depression. You didn’t cause it.
• Don’t make major life decisions while you are depressed. This includes marriage, divorce, separation, quitting your job, etc. You may not be thinking clearly while you are depressed. If you must make an important decision, ask someone you trust to help you.
• Don’t expect to do everything you normally can. Set a realistic schedule.
• Don’t get discouraged. It will take time for your depression to lift fully. Be patient with yourself.
• Don’t give up.

People who have depression sometimes think about suicide. This thinking is a common symptom of the depression. If you have thoughts about hurting yourself, tell someone. Tell your doctor, your friends, or your family. Or you could call your local suicide hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

Get help right away. There are people who can help you. Depression can be successfully treated."
107,Diabetes in Kids - Signs and Causes,https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetes-in-kids/,"Diabetes—in kids and adults—is a long-lasting (chronic) condition that affects how your body turns sugars known as glucose into energy. Your body turns most of the food you eat into glucose and releases it into your blood stream. It does this using a hormone called insulin.

Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your body doesn’t make or use insulin properly. It causes too much glucose to build up in the blood. There are two types of diabetes.

Type 1 occurs when your body doesn’t produce any insulin. It is often called juvenile diabetes because it is typically diagnosed when people are young but can be diagnosed in adults, too. Until recently, this was the most common type of diabetes in children and teens. In more recent years there has been an increase in Type 2 diabetes in all age groups.

Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough insulin or doesn’t use the insulin as it should. Doctors think the increase in Type 2 diabetes among kids is tied to an increase in having obesity and a drop in physical activity.","The symptoms of diabetes can vary from person to person. The early stages might have very few symptoms. You may not even be aware your child has the disease.

• Extreme hunger or thirst
• Frequent urination
• Unexplained weight loss
• Fatigue or drowsiness
• Blurry vision
• Slow-healing wounds, sores or bruises
• Dry, itchy skin
• Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet
• Frequent or recurring skin, gum, bladder or vaginal yeast infections

If your child’s blood sugar gets too low, they might:

• Feel tired
• Experience problems with muscle coordination
• Sweat
• Have difficulty thinking or speaking clearly
• Twitch
• Feel like they’re going to faint
• Become pale
• Lose consciousness
• Have a seizure

At the earliest sign of any of these symptoms, your child should eat or drink something that will raise their blood sugar fast. This could include candy, juice, milk, or raisins. If they don’t feel better in 15 minutes or if monitoring shows that their blood sugar level is still too low, they should eat or drink another item to raise their blood sugar fast. Always keep a supply of these items on hand for emergencies.

You may not know if your child’s blood sugar is too high unless you test it yourself. However, they may experience common symptoms such as frequent urination, extreme thirst, blurry vision, and feeling tired. Some factors unrelated to food can make your child’s blood sugar high. These include not taking your insulin correctly, overeating at a meal, illness, having hormonal changes, and stress.

If your child’s blood sugar level is too high and they take insulin, they may need to take an extra dose of rapid- or short-acting insulin to return it to normal. Your doctor can tell you how much insulin they need to take to lower their blood sugar level.","The cause of diabetes depends on the type.

With type 1 diabetes, your child’s body doesn’t make insulin. This is because the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin. Your child’s risk for type 1 diabetes is greater if one of their parents or one of their siblings has it.

With type 2 diabetes, the pancreas still makes insulin, but it doesn’t make enough. Type 2 diabetes can also happen if the cells in your child’s body can’t use insulin properly. This is called insulin resistance. This causes glucose (a form of sugar) to build up in the child’s blood instead of moving into the cells. Too much glucose in the blood can lead to health problems that damage the blood vessels, nerves, heart eyes and kidneys.

There are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes in kids. These include:

• Weight. Obesity is the single most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The more overweight it is, the more resistant your body is to insulin. To determine if your child is overweight, talk to their doctor.
• Family history. Be sure to let your child’s doctor know if diabetes runs in the family. Their risk for diabetes is higher if a parent or sibling has diabetes.","After examining your child, discussing symptoms and going over their health history, your doctor may test for diabetes if they suspect your child is at risk. Testing can include:

• Fasting blood sugar test. This test is usually done in the morning, after an 8-hour fast (not eating or drinking anything except water for 8 hours before the test). The blood test involves inserting a small needle into a vein in your child’s arm to withdraw blood. If your child’s blood sugar level is 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher, it suggests diabetes. Fasting blood sugar can also be measured with a finger stick, as long as only the glucose is being tested.
• Random blood sugar test. This test measures the level of glucose in your child’s blood at any time of day. It doesn’t matter when they last ate. Combined with symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes.
• A1C blood test. This test provides information about a person’s average levels of blood glucose over the previous 3 months. The results are reported as a percentage. A normal A1C level is below 5.7%. If your A1C is higher than that, it means your blood sugar has been higher than normal. A test result between 5.7% and 6.4% indicates prediabetes. A result of 6.5% or above indicates diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented or avoided. There are some lifestyle changes that may help lower your child’s risk for type 2 diabetes:

• Exercise and weight control. Exercising and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce your child’s risk of diabetes. Any amount of activity is better than none. Try to help your child exercise or move around for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week.
• Diet. A diet high in sugar and calories increases your child’s risk of diabetes. A poor diet can lead to obesity (another risk factor for diabetes) and other health problems.","The single most important thing your child can do is control their blood sugar level. They can do this by eating right, exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and, if needed, taking oral medicines or insulin.","Your child can live a normal life with well-controlled diabetes. However, they have to pay attention to their diet, weight, exercise, and medicine. If you don’t control your diabetes, you will have too much glucose in your blood. This can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and damage to the nerves and kidneys.","• Is my child at risk for diabetes?
• What can I do to lower their risk?
• Will my child need to take insulin?
• Can my child’s diabetes get worse even if we do everything right?","Mayo Clinic: Type 1 Diabetes in Children

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Your child’s diet should include lots of complex carbohydrates (such as whole grains), fruits, and vegetables. It’s important to eat at least 3 meals per day and never skip a meal. Your child should eat at about the same time every day. This helps keep their insulin or medicine and sugar levels steady. Avoid empty calories, such as foods high in sugar and fat, or alcohol.

Exercising helps your child’s body use insulin and lower their blood sugar level. It also helps control their weight, gives them more energy, and is good for their overall health.

Losing excess weight and maintaining a healthy body weight will help insulin work better in your child’s body.

If your child’s diabetes can’t be controlled with diet, exercise, and weight control, their doctor may recommend medicine or insulin. Most people who have type 2 diabetes start with an oral medicine (taken by mouth). Oral medicines can make their body produce more insulin. They also help their body use the insulin it makes more efficiently. Oral medicine doesn’t work for everyone, though. It isn’t effective in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Some people need to add insulin to their bodies with insulin injections, insulin pens, or insulin pumps. Insulin therapy is necessary for all people who have type 1 diabetes and for some people who have type 2 diabetes. If insulin is required, you’ll have to help give your child a shot or teach them to do it on their own (either with a syringe or with an insulin pen). Your doctor will tell you which kind of medicine your child should take and why. Make sure your child takes their medicines exactly as their doctor prescribes.

Your doctor will test your child’s blood sugar every 3 months with an A1C test. Your doctor may ask you to test your child’s blood sugar on your own throughout the day if they are taking insulin or they are adjusting their medication. You will need to use a blood glucose monitor to check it on your own at home. This involves pricking your child’s finger for blood and putting a test strip in the blood. You then insert the test strip in the monitor for results. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are also an option to help people with diabetes measure their blood glucose around the clock. A CGM is worn on the arm and offers real-time blood sugar levels you can check with an app on your phone."
108,Diabetes Insipidus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetes-insipidus/,"Despite the name, diabetes insipidus is not related to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Diabetes insipidus is a hormone disorder. It occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It can also occur if your body doesn’t use the hormone effectively. ADH helps your body balance water in the urine and blood.","There are several symptoms of diabetes insipidus, including:

• Extreme thirst
• Increased urine production up to 16 quarts a day
• Getting up multiple times in the night to urinate or wetting the bed
• Confusion and changes in alertness due to dehydration","Diabetes insipidus has several causes. In some people, a part of the brain (called the hypothalamus) doesn’t make enough ADH. In other cases, the pituitary gland doesn’t release enough of the hormone. Damage to either the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland can cause diabetes insipidus. This can occur after a head injury, during brain surgery, or when a tumor grows on the glands.

Abnormalities in the kidneys can also cause diabetes insipidus. This can affect the way they process ADH. Diabetes insipidus can be caused by some medicines, such as lithium. About 30% of the time, doctors can’t find the cause.","To check for diabetes insipidus, your doctor may order one of several tests:

• A urine test. This will show how much water is in your urine. It can rule out type 1 or type 2 diabetes. (If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, there will be excess sugar in your urine.)
• A blood test. This will check for high sodium levels – another indication of diabetes insipidus.
• A water deprivation test. This test can take several hours. You aren’t allowed to drink any liquids during this time. Your weight, urine and blood will be checked every hour.
• An MRI (magnetic resonance image) scan. The scan can show problems in the brain that could be causing your diabetes insipidus.","Most of the time, diabetes insipidus is a permanent condition. You likely won’t be able to prevent it. It is often associated with another health problem, such as abnormal kidney function or tumors. Even though you can’t prevent it in these cases, you can often manage the symptoms.","If your symptoms are mild, you might not need treatment. However, your doctor will want to check on you more often. You should make sure you always have something to drink. This will ensure that your body doesn’t get dehydrated.

For more severe cases of diabetes insipidus, your doctor may prescribe medicine. This medicine will help your body produce or more effectively use ADH. One medicine called desmopressin is a synthetic form of ADH. It comes in pill form, as a shot, or as a nasal spray. Drinking too much while taking this medicine can overload your body with fluids. This can make you feel sick, weak, or dizzy.

Other treatments will depend on the cause of the illness:

• If it is caused by kidney problems: Your doctor may recommend that you reduce salt in your diet. You’ll also need to drink enough water to avoid dehydration. Medicines like water pills may help your body balance salt and water.
• If it is caused by tumors or abnormal growths on your hypothalamus or pituitary gland: Your doctor may suggest surgery to remove the growths.
• If a medicine is causing diabetes insipidus: Your doctor may prescribe another type. He or she will look for a medicine that won’t cause excessive thirst and urination.

Talk to your doctor about which option is right for you.",There is no cure for diabetes insipidus. But you can work with your doctor to manage the symptoms. Medicine can help prevent the constant thirst and excessive urination that comes with this condition. Preventing these symptoms will add a great deal to your quality of life.,"• What is the likely cause of my diabetes insipidus?
• What’s the best treatment option for me? Will I need medicine? Surgery?
• What are the risks and benefits of this treatment option?

109,Diabetic Ketoacidosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetic-ketoacidosis/,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) happens when your blood sugar is higher than normal and your insulin level is lower than normal. This imbalance in the body causes a build-up of ketones. Ketones are toxic. If DKA isn’t treated, it can lead to diabetic coma and even death.

DKA mainly affects people who have type 1 diabetes. But it can also happen with other types of diabetes, including type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy).","DKA is a very serious condition. If you have diabetes and think you may have DKA, contact your doctor or go to a hospital right away. The first symptoms to appear are usually:

• Excessive thirst
• Dry mouth
• Frequent urination

The next stage of DKA symptoms includes:

• Vomiting (usually more than once)
• Abdominal pain
• Diarrhea
• Trouble breathing
• Confusion or trouble concentrating
• Loss of appetite
• Weakness and fatigue
• A fruity odor on the breath

If your sugar is very high or symptoms are severe (especially confusion), you should go to the nearest emergency room.","The main cause of DKA is not producing enough insulin. A lack of insulin means sugar can’t get into your cells. Your cells need sugar for energy. This lack of insulin causes your body’s glucose levels to rise. To get energy, your body starts to burn fat. This process causes ketones to build up. Ketones can poison the body.

High blood glucose levels can also cause you to urinate often. This leads to dehydration.

DKA can be caused by missing an insulin dose, eating poorly, or feeling stressed. An infection or other illness (such as pneumonia or a urinary tract infection) can also lead to DKA. If you have signs of infection (fever, cough, or sore throat), contact your doctor. It’s important to get the right treatment. For some people, DKA may be the first sign they have diabetes.","If you think you may have diabetic ketoacidosis, contact your doctor right away. They will want to run some blood tests before giving you an official diagnosis. These tests include checking your blood sugar and ketone level. Your doctor also may order a urinalysis (requiring a urine sample) and chest X-ray.","If you have diabetes, there are some things you can do to watch for diabetic ketoacidosis. When you’re sick, watch your blood sugar level very closely so it doesn’t get too high or too low. Ask your doctor what your critical blood sugar level is. Patients should watch their glucose level closely when those levels are more than 250 mg per dL.

When you’re sick or stressed, you should check your blood sugar level more often than normal (sometimes every 3 to 4 hours). If your blood sugar reaches a critical level, check it every 1 to 2 hours. Ask your doctor if you should test your blood sugar level during the night.

You should also test your urine for ketones every few hours if you’re sick, stressed, or if your blood sugar level is more than 250 mg per dL.

You should talk to your doctor to develop a plan if your blood sugar level gets too high. Make sure that you know how to reach your doctor in an emergency.","DKA causes excessive urination. This means you will urinate more than usual. You can become dehydrated and your body can lose electrolytes (minerals in your blood that help your body function). If you are diagnosed with DKA, your doctor will most likely treat you with fluids (usually through an IV). These fluids will contain electrolytes and insulin. Electrolytes will help your body function normally. Insulin will help lower your blood sugar level. Overall, fluids can help rehydrate you and dilute some of the sugar in your blood.","Keeping the balance between blood sugar and insulin is the key to controlling diabetic ketoacidosis. In most cases, this means sticking to your insulin schedule. But you may need to adjust the amount of insulin you’re taking.

You should also try to recognize when you feel stressed or sick. Small adjustments to your eating or drinking can make a big difference.","• I’ve never been diagnosed with diabetes, but I have many of the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Do I have diabetes?
• I’m having a hard time controlling my blood sugar levels. Am I at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis?
• Will diet and exercise help me to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis?
• If I notice I’m having symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, what should I do first?
• Is it safe for me to exercise?
• How often should I check my blood sugar level if I’m sick?
• What is the best way for me to check the ketone level in my body?
• I missed a dose of insulin. Should I start testing my blood sugar level and ketone level right away?","American Diabetes Association: DKA (Ketoacidosis) & Ketones

Your body needs insulin even if you’re not eating. Ask your doctor whether it’s necessary to adjust your dose or take extra insulin.

If you use an insulin pump, keep a variety of supplies on hand. Make sure that you have short-acting insulin, long-acting insulin, and needles in case your pump is not working right. You also should have an emergency phone number to call for help with your pump.

When you’re sick, drink lots of sugar-free, caffeine-free liquids. Sip small amounts every few minutes if you’re feeling sick to your stomach.

If your blood sugar level is more than 250 mg per dL, avoid foods that are high in carbohydrates."
110,Diabetic Nephropathy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetic-nephropathy/,"Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes and affects the kidneys. In healthy kidneys, many tiny blood vessels filter waste products from your body. These blood vessels have holes that are big enough to allow tiny waste products to pass through into the urine. But the blood vessels are still small enough to keep useful products (such as protein and red blood cells) in the blood. High levels of sugar in the blood can damage these vessels if diabetes is not controlled. This can cause kidney disease, which is also called nephropathy. If the damage is bad enough, your kidneys could stop working.","Diabetic nephropathy does not usually cause any symptoms until kidney damage is severe. As the condition progresses, symptoms can include the following:

• Swelling of the feet and ankles
• Weakness
• Loss of appetite
• Upset stomach
• Insomnia and difficulty sleeping
• Confusion and trouble thinking","Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes. Over time, high levels of sugar can damage kidneys. Kidney damage is more likely if your blood sugar is uncontrolled, and your diabetes is not managed. It is also more likely if you smoke or if you have high blood pressure. Diabetic nephropathy is more common in people who are African American, Mexican American, or Native American, according to the National Institutes of Health.","Your doctor will test your urine for protein. If there is protein in your urine, this could mean that your diabetes has damaged the holes in the blood vessels of your kidneys. This makes the holes big enough for protein (and other nutrients your body needs) to leak into your urine. Your doctor may also want to do a blood test to see how much damage has been done to the kidneys.",The best way to prevent diabetic nephropathy is to keep your blood sugar regulated. You should also regularly check your blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to a decrease in kidney function. Keeping blood pressure in the normal range can help prevent damage to your kidneys.,"If you have been diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy, you cannot reverse the damage, but you can slow it. Here are some of the most important things you can do to protect your kidneys:

• Keep your blood pressure lower than 140 over 90. High blood pressurecan speed up damage to the kidneys. Your doctor may give you medicine to help lower your blood pressure.
• Control your blood sugar level. Take your diabetes medicines and/or insulin exactly as your doctor prescribes.
• Stick to a healthy diet. People who have diabetic nephropathy may need to eat less protein.
• Be physically activeevery day.
• Stop smoking.
• Check with your doctor before taking any new medicines. This includes vitamins, herbal medicines, and over-the-counter medicines.
• Keep your doctor appointments.

Even with the right treatments, diabetic nephropathy can get worse over time. Your kidneys could stop working. This is called kidney failure. If this happens, waste products build up in your body. This can cause nausea, vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath, and confusion. In severe cases, kidney failure can cause seizures and coma.

If you have kidney failure, your doctor will refer you for dialysis. In dialysis, a machine is used to take waste products out of the blood. One kind of dialysis must be done in a clinic. For another kind of dialysis, the machine is so small you can strap it to your body while you go about your daily activities. If you develop kidney failure, your doctor will help you decide which type of dialysis machine is right for you.",Receiving treatment early can slow or even stop diabetic nephropathy from advancing. The disease progresses slowly. Not everyone who develops diabetic nephropathy will reach the stage of kidney failure. Having diabetes does not mean you will develop the disease.,"• I have diabetic nephropathy. Could my kidneys fail?
• Will I need dialysis for my kidneys?
• Are there any medicines that I shouldn’t take?
• Could herbal supplements be dangerous for me?
• What is the best thing I can to prevent further damage to my kidneys?

111,Diabetic Neuropathy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetic-neuropathy/,Diabetic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that happens in people who have diabetes. This damage makes it hard for their nerves to carry messages to the brain and other parts of the body.,"Diabetic neuropathy can cause the following symptoms:

• Changes of sensation, numbness (loss of feeling), or painful tingling and burning in parts of the body, especially your feet, legs, and toes
• Muscle weakness and difficulty walking
• Your feet heal slowly when you get cuts, sores, or blisters on them. Also, they don’t hurt as much as you would expect","Diabetes causes the level of sugar in your blood to be higher than normal. Over time, high blood sugar levels damage your blood vessels and nerves. That’s why people whose blood sugars are not well controlled are more likely to get diabetic neuropathy.

Men are more likely to have diabetic neuropathy than women. High cholesterol levels and smoking also increase your risk.","Your doctor or nurse should check your feet periodically when you go in for a visit. If you are diabetic and have symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, your doctor will take a complete health history and perform a physical exam. If you have never been diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor may order a blood test first. Nerve function tests may be used to diagnose diabetic neuropathy. Nerve function tests will measure your response to electrical signals, sensitivity to touch, and changes in temperature.","The most important thing is to keep your blood sugar under control. Take your medicines and/or insulin exactly as your doctor prescribes. Eat a healthy diet. If you are overweight, ask your doctor to help you lose weight. Get plenty of exercise.

Here are some other ways to protect your feet:

• Wash your feet every day with lukewarm (not hot) water and mild soap.
• Dry your feet well, especially between the toes. Use a soft towel and pat gently; don’t rub.
• Keep the skin of your feet smooth by applying a small amount of cream or lotion, especially on the heels. If the skin is cracked, talk to your doctor about how to treat it.
• Check your feet every day. You may need a mirror to look at the bottoms of your feet. Call your doctor if you have redness, swelling, pain that doesn’t go away, numbness, or tingling in any part of your foot.
• Don’t treat calluses, corns, or bunions without talking to your doctor first.
• Cut toenails straight across to avoid ingrown toenails. It might help to soak your toenails in warm water to soften them before you cut them. File the edges of your toenails carefully.
• Don’t let your feet get too hot or too cold.
• Don’t go barefoot.

When choosing shoes and socks, use these guidelines:

• Don’t wear shoes without socks.
• Don’t wear sandals or other open-toed shoes.
• Avoid high-heeled shoes and shoes with pointed toes.
• Wear comfortable socks that aren’t too tight. Change them every day.
• Don’t wear uncomfortable or tight shoes that rub or cut into your feet. If you’ve had problems before because of shoes that didn’t fit, you may want to be fitted for a custom-molded shoe.
• Talk to your doctor before you buy special shoes or inserts.
• Shop for new shoes at the end of the day when your feet are a little swollen. If shoes are comfortable when your feet are swollen, they’ll probably be comfortable all day.
• Break in new shoes gradually.
• Look inside your shoes every day for things like gravel or torn linings. These things could rub against your feet and cause blisters or sores.","There is no cure for diabetic neuropathy. Treatment focuses on slowing the development of the condition. You can do this by controlling blood sugar levels and making lifestyle changes. These lifestyle changes not only help slow nerve damage, but also promote overall health. They include:

• Eating a healthy diet
• Exercising regularly
• Maintaining a healthy weight
• Controlling blood pressure
• Not smoking
• Limiting alcohol use

Treatment for diabetic neuropathy also focuses on relieving pain and discomfort. There are several medicines available that help ease neuropathy pain. Your doctor will help you decide which is the best for you.","Taking good care of your feet is critical when you have diabetic neuropathy. Try to prevent injuries to your feet. Exercise to help keep muscles strong. Pay special attention if you see a crack or sore on either of your feet. Keep your skin dry. Apply a small amount of lotion to your feet each day to keep your skin soft and reduce cracking. If you are having any problems, such as increased numbness, sores, or ingrown toenails, tell your doctor right away.","• I haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes, but my feet are numb and sometimes tingle. Should I be tested for diabetes?
• Do I really need to adjust my footwear?
• If I get a sore on my foot, should I see my doctor immediately, or is it okay to monitor it myself?
• Can you recommend a good lotion for my feet?

112,Diabetic Retinopathy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetic-retinopathy/,"Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that affects people who have diabetes. It affects your retina. The retina is the part of your eye that is sensitive to light. The retina sends messages to your brain about what you see. A healthy retina is necessary for good vision.

Diabetic retinopathy can cause blurry vision and progressive vision loss. When it’s found early, laser treatment can help keep you from losing your vision. If it’s not treated, retinopathy can cause blindness.

It is important to note that retinopathy can occur even in well-controlled diabetes. You should be evaluated for retinopathy if you have diabetes.","The early stages of diabetic retinopathy may present few, if any, symptoms. That’s why eye exams are important. The American Optometric Association recommends that people who have diabetes get a comprehensive dilated eye exam once a year.

The symptoms for diabetic retinopathy can be mild to severe. Call your doctor if you:

• Have blurry vision for more than 2 days
• Suddenly lose vision in 1 or both eyes
• See floaters (black or gray spots, cobwebs, or strings that move or drift when you move your eyes)
• See flashing lights that aren’t really there
• Have pain or pressure in your eye(s)","Uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes can damage the small blood vessels of the retina. When the blood vessels of your retina are damaged, fluid can leak from them and cause swelling. The swelling and fluid can cause blurry vision and make it hard for you to see. If retinopathy worsens, your eye may begin to form new blood vessels over the retina. These vessels are fragile and can break easily and bleed. This bleeding can cause severe vision loss and blindness.","Your eye doctor may find evidence of diabetic retinopathy during a routine eye exam even if you have no symptoms. You probably won’t notice the early signs of diabetic retinopathy. These early changes in your eyes can only be seen using special equipment.

The best way for your eye doctor to check for this condition is to dilate your eyes. Dilating your eyes opens up your pupils. This makes it easier to see the insides of your eyes. They can dilate your eyes using eye drops.

While your eyes are dilated, your doctor will look for anything unusual. This includes looking for swelling, scar tissue, and abnormalities in blood vessels. They will also evaluate your optic nerve.","The best way to prevent diabetic retinopathy is to work with your doctor to manage your diabetes. You should also have your eyes checked regularly—at least once a year. Your doctor can tell you if you should have them checked more often.

Often, especially in rural areas, your family doctor may be able to screen you for diabetic retinopathy in their office. In these instances, your doctor will take an image of your dilated retina and send it to an eye doctor for review.

Tips for preventing diabetic retinopathy:

• Control your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol.
• Get a yearly eye exam.
• Exercise regularly.
• Eat a healthy diet.
• Quit smoking.
• Avoid alcohol.
• See your family doctor regularly.","There’s no cure for diabetic retinopathy. But there are some treatment options that can help prevent or slow down vision loss. These are more effective in the early stages of the condition.

• Laser treatment is one way to prevent vision loss. Lasers can seal leaking blood vessels within the retina. They also can blast abnormal blood vessels there.
• Anti-inflammatory medicine (steroids) also may lessen vision loss in diabetic retinopathy. This medicine works to help shrink abnormal blood vessels in the retina.
• Anti-VEGF medicine can help reduce the growth of abnormal blood vessels. It also reduces swelling of the macula.
• Your doctor may suggest a surgery called vitrectomy. This involves removing the vitreous gel from your eye. Doing this can improve vision by letting light flow through to the retina.",Learning to live with vision loss is difficult. The best way to prevent vision loss is to manage your diabetes. Keep your blood sugar at an appropriate level with the help of your doctor. Go in for a thorough eye exam every year or as recommended by your doctor. Doing these things can prevent vision loss even if you have been diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy.,"• Am I at risk for diabetic retinopathy?
• What signs should I look for if I think I may have diabetic retinopathy?
• If I get diabetic retinopathy, can the vision loss be reversed?

113,Diaper Rash,https://familydoctor.org/condition/diaper-rash/,"Diaper rash is redness and rash on a baby’s bottom or genital area. It is a very common rash. Most babies will get it from time to time. Normally, diaper rash can be treated easily at home.","The most common symptom of diaper rash is red, tender-looking skin in the diaper area (buttocks, thighs, and genitals). It could be a few spots, or the rash could cover much of the diaper area. Babies with diaper rash often fuss or cry when the area is touched or cleaned.

In bad cases, the rash can cause pimples, blisters, or other sores on your baby’s diaper area. If the rash gets infected, it may become bright red and the skin may get swollen. Small red patches or spots may spread beyond the main part of the rash, even outside the diaper area.

• Pimples or small ulcers form.
• The rash bleeds or oozes fluid.
• Your baby has a fever.
• The rash spreads to other areas, such as the arms, face, or scalp.
• The rash gets worse despite home treatment.
• The diaper rash occurs in the first 6 weeks of life.","Diaper rash can be caused by a number of factors, including:

• Irritation from stool or urine. Babies left in a wet or dirty diaper for too long can get diaper rash. Frequent stools or diarrhea can also irritate the skin.
• Friction. Diapers that rub against the skin or fit too tightly can cause irritation.
• Candida infection. Candida is a fungus that grows in warm, moist places. The rash it causes, also called a yeast infection, is usually bright red with smaller red spots around the edges.
• Allergic reaction. Soap, laundry detergent, fabric softener, disposable diapers, baby wipes, or lotions can irritate your baby’s skin. Watch your baby’s skin carefully for reactions. Stop using products that appear to cause a rash.
• New foods. Changes in your baby’s diet can change the content and frequency of their stools. This can make diaper rash more likely. A breastfed baby could develop a rash in reaction to something the mother has eaten.
• Antibiotics. Yeast infections are common after a baby has been taking antibiotics, or if the mother is on antibiotics while breastfeeding.",Your doctor will examine the rash to diagnose it. Tests are not usually necessary. Many times you can start treatment at home without seeing your doctor.,"In many cases, diaper rash can be avoided or prevented. Make these steps part of your daily routine.

• Check your baby’s diaper often and change it as soon as it’s wet or soiled.
• Allow your baby’s skin to dry completely before putting on another diaper.
• Secure diapers loosely to allow for airflow.
• Don’t allow adhesive tabs to stick to your baby’s skin.
• Wash your hands before and after changing diapers to prevent spreading germs that could cause infections.
• Some babies get rashes often. You can apply a barrier ointment at every diaper change to prevent irritation. Products that contain zinc oxide (such as Desitin) or petroleum (such as Vaseline) are good choices.
• Don’t use powders, such as cornstarch or baby powder, on your baby’s bottom. Inhaled powder can irritate their lungs.","The key to treating diaper rash is to keep your baby’s diaper area as clean, cool, and dry as possible.

Change your baby’s diaper often. Avoid baby wipes, which often contain alcohol or fragrance that can be irritating. Clean the skin with warm (not hot) water or very mild soap.

Let him or her go without a diaper when possible to let the air dry the skin. Try placing your baby on an open cloth diaper during naptime. (Check the diaper shortly after your baby falls asleep and replace it if it’s wet. Babies often urinate right after falling asleep.)

You can apply diaper rash ointment or cream to the affected area before putting on a new diaper. Don’t use creams that contain boric acid, camphor, phenol, methyl salicylate, or compound of benzoin tincture. These chemicals can be harmful.

If the rash appears to be caused by a candida infection, call your doctor. It may need to be treated with antifungal cream or medicine.","Diaper rash is very common in babies, especially those between 4 and 15 months old. Do the best you can to prevent it. But sometimes it can’t be avoided. Home treatment often clears up diaper rash in a few days. If that does not work, call your family doctor.

If you use cloth diapers, you should also keep these tips in mind.

• Wash diapers in hot water with bleach to kill germs. You can also boil them for 15 minutes on the stove after washing.
• Rinse diapers 2-3 times to remove all soap and chemicals.
• If you use detergent, be sure to choose detergent for sensitive skin. There are some brands specific to babies and cloth diapers.
• Avoid fabric softener and dryer sheets, which can irritate skin.
• Try to avoid plastic pants that fit over diapers. They increase heat and moisture in the diaper area. This makes it easier for diaper rash to start and for germs to grow.","• How often should I change my baby’s diaper?
• What ointment would be best for my baby?
• Are cloth or disposable diapers better?
• What should I do if the diaper rash spreads or gets worse?
• My baby is on antibiotics. Is there a way I can prevent him/her from getting diaper rash?
• Should I leave my baby’s diaper off while he/she is asleep?

114,Diverticular Disease (Diverticulitis),https://familydoctor.org/condition/diverticular-disease/,"Diverticular disease is a group of conditions that affect your large intestine (colon). It involves small pouches or sacs, called diverticula. These pouches can form in your intestine wall. They can push through the wall of your colon. The most common conditions of diverticular disease are:

• Diverticulosis. This is the base condition where the pouches form. It becomes more common as you age. Most people with diverticulosis don’t know they have it.
• Diverticulitis. This occurs when the pouches become inflamed or infected. It can cause pain and other symptoms. Serious cases could require staying in the hospital.
• Diverticular bleeding. Diverticular bleeding occurs when a blood vessel in a pouch bursts. It’s not as common as diverticulitis.","Diverticulosis normally doesn’t have symptoms. It could cause mild cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. Many other conditions cause these symptoms, too.

The most common symptom of diverticulitis is severe abdominal pain usually felt in the lower left side of your abdomen and that comes on suddenly. The pain can also start out mild and increase over several days. Other symptoms could include fever, nausea, constipation, or diarrhea.

You may have diverticular bleeding if you see a large amount of blood in your stool or in the toilet. Call your doctor right away if any of these things happen. Also call your doctor right away if you notice blood coming from your rectum.","Doctors haven’t determined exactly what causes diverticular disease. They think it not eating enough fiber could be a major factor. When you don’t eat enough fiber, your stools may not be soft. You can get constipated. Constipation and hard stools increase the pressure in the bowel walls. This pressure may cause the diverticular pouches to form.

Other factors that could contribute to diverticular disease include:

• Genetics
• Lack of exercise
• Obesity
• Smoking
• Decrease in healthy gut bacteria
• Increase in disease-causing bacteria in your colon
• Certain medicines, including steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen

Diverticular disease becomes more common as you age. Your risk starts increasing after age 40. Most people have it by the time they’re 80 years old.","If you’re having symptoms, your doctor may check your abdomen for tenderness. They may ask about your bowel habits, diet, and any medicines you take. Your doctor may want to do tests to look for diverticular disease. These tests can include:

• CT scan. This type of X-ray allows your doctor to see if you have pouches in your colon. It can show if any are inflamed or infected. This is the most common test for diagnosing diverticular disease.
• Barium enema (also called a lower GI series). This test injects liquid barium into your rectum and colon. The barium makes your colon more visible on the X-rays that will be taken.
• Flexible sigmoidoscopy. In this test, your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube with a light on the end into your rectum. The tube is connected to a tiny video camera. This allows your doctor to look at your rectum and the last part of your colon.
• In this procedure, the video camera and light go through your rectum and your whole colon. This allows your doctor to see the inside of your entire large intestine. Before the test, you receive medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy. While a colonoscopy may be uncomfortable, it’s usually not painful.

Sometimes, doctors find diverticular disease when you are being tested for something else. This could include a routine screening to check for colorectal cancer or when tests are performed to diagnose other digestive problems.","The best way to prevent diverticular disease is with a healthy lifestyle and a high-fiber diet. You can increase the amount of fiber in your diet by eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain foods. Also, be sure to drink plenty of fluids and exercise regularly.","Diverticulosis treatment focuses on preventing the pouches from getting inflamed or infected. Your doctor may recommend:

• A high-fiber diet
• Fiber supplements
• Medicines
• Probiotics

For mild cases of diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend rest and a liquid diet until symptoms ease. They may also prescribe medicine to treat the infection.

For severe cases of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding, you may need to stay in the hospital. There you can get intravenous medicine and the rest you need. Some people need surgery to remove the pouches and diseased parts of their colon.","If you have diverticulosis, you may sometimes get flare-ups of diverticulitis. To prevent these, your doctor may suggest you eat more fiber, drink plenty of fluids, and exercise regularly. This should help prevent the pouches from becoming infected or inflamed.

In the past, doctors thought people with diverticulosis should avoid certain foods like nuts, seeds, and popcorn. However, research now suggests these foods aren’t harmful and won’t cause diverticulitis flare-ups. Still, everyone is different. If you think certain foods are making your symptoms worse, stop eating them and talk to your doctor.

If you start feeling symptoms of diverticulitis, call your doctor right away. Untreated diverticulitis can lead to dangerous complications, including intestinal blockages and openings in the bowel wall. Diverticular disease can also lead to an abscess that could require surgery.","• What lifestyle changes can I make to prevent diverticular disease from getting worse?
• Is diverticular disease a sign of colon cancer or another health condition?
• Does having diverticular disease put me at an increased risk of colorectal cancer?

115,Down Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/down-syndrome/,"Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes physical problems and intellectual disabilities. It is most often caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome number 21. This condition is called Trisomy 21.

Each person born with Down syndrome is different. Some have health problems. These could include heart disease, hearing problems, thyroid disorders, obesity, or problems with their intestines. Many begin treatment for medical issues early and live full, healthy, productive lives.","There are many signs and symptoms of Down syndrome. Some people have different symptoms than others. Additionally, some have different problems at different points in their lives. Many people with Down syndrome share a distinct appearance.

• Upward, slanting eyes
• Flattened facial features
• Protruding tongue
• Short neck
• Small head, ears, and mouth
• Broad hands with short fingers
• Decreased muscle tone

Because of some of these physical features, children with Down syndrome often develop at a slower rate. This includes when they learn to roll over, sit, stand, and walk. They do eventually reach these milestones, but it takes them longer. Physical issues in areas such as the heart, brain, and GI tract can cause health problems.

In addition to physical signs, people with Down syndrome often have problems with thinking and learning.",Down syndrome is caused by a problem during cell division. This results in extra genetic material. The extra genetic material causes the features and problems of Down syndrome.,"Screening for Down syndrome is a normal part of prenatal care and has evolved over time. Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a blood test used in prenatal screening. It can determine the risk that the fetus will be born with certain genetic abnormalities. The test is most often used to look for chromosomal disorders, such as the one that causes Down syndrome. NIPT is considered noninvasive because it requires drawing blood only from the pregnant woman and does not pose any risk to the fetus, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The NIPT test is very accurate, but cannot be used to diagnose Down syndrome. It only indicates your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. Some women test positive in the screen but have perfectly healthy babies.

The only way to diagnose Down syndrome before birth is through diagnostic testing. This involves checking the tissue and fluid in the womb for the extra chromosome. This can be done through:

• Chorionic villus sampling (CVS).This takes a sample of the placenta during weeks 10 to14 of pregnancy.
• This takes a sample of the amniotic fluid during weeks 14 to 18 of pregnancy.
• Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS).This takes a sample of the fetal blood in the umbilical cord during weeks 18 to 22 of pregnancy. It is the most accurate test.

There is a slight risk that these tests can cause a miscarriage. So, doctors only use these tests when there is a higher chance of a genetic problem in the baby. This could be if the mother is 35 or older or if the mother received an abnormal screening result. After birth, your doctor can test the baby’s blood for the extra chromosome. This is done if the baby has any of the physical signs or birth defects of Down syndrome.

This decision is up to you. Some women feel better if they know their risk. They can prepare themselves for the possibility of having a baby who has Down syndrome. Your doctor can help you understand your risks and consider the pros and cons of getting tested.","There is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid your child having Down syndrome. However, the risk is lower if you have children at a younger age.","There isn’t one standard treatment for Down syndrome. A person’s treatment depends on their individual case. This includes their physical and intellectual needs, strengths, and limitations. Having Down syndrome puts your child at increased risk for a number of health problems. These need different forms of treatment. Treatments could be one-time (such as surgery) or lifelong (such as a special diet).

Treatment could start when your child is a baby. This could happen if they are born with a problem, such as a heart defect. Doctors may screen them for other problems that commonly occur with Down syndrome. These include hypothyroidism, hearing loss, vision problems, blood disorders, and digestive problems.

Your child will most likely have a team of health professionals. This team will include doctors, specialists, and therapists. They will work together to give your child the treatment and therapy they need. This will allow them to live as productive a life as possible. Services may include early intervention, therapies, and assistive devices.

Early intervention involves specialized programs and resources. These are provided to babies and toddlers with Down syndrome and their families. They usually start at birth and last until the child turns 3 years old. From that age, the public school system provides physical, academic, speech and occupational therapy, and life skills support through the age of 21. Research has shown that early intervention improves outcomes for these children later in life.

There are a variety of therapies that can help a child with Down syndrome. These include:

• Physical therapy– exercises and activities that increase strength, improve posture and balance, and build motor skills. Many children with Down syndrome have low muscle tone. Physical therapy can be particularly helpful for them.
• Speech therapy –helps them communicate better and improve their language skills. Children with Down syndrome often speak later than other children. This therapy can help them develop those skills.
• Occupational therapy –adjusts everyday activities to the child’s abilities. This therapy teaches skills your child will use every day. These include eating, getting dressed, handwriting, and caring for themselves.
• Behavioral therapy –helps your child cope with his or her condition. Complicated feelings and behaviors often go along with it. Children with Down syndrome get frustrated and can develop compulsive behaviors. They are more likely to have ADHD or other mental health issues. Therapy with a mental health professional can help.","There are other health problems that often go along with having Down syndrome. Every person with Down syndrome is different. Your child may or may not have or develop any of these other conditions.

• Poor muscle tone. This makes it harder for them to learn to roll over, sit up and walk. Physical therapy can help with these problems.
• Heart defects. About half of babies who have Down syndrome also have a heart problem. An ultrasound exam of your baby’s heart will show any defects. Surgery may be necessary to fix the heart problems associated with Down syndrome.
• Digestive problems. Some babies who have Down syndrome have problems swallowing. Others may have blockages in their intestines. Surgery may be necessary to fix these problems. Once they are fixed, they usually cause no further harm. Children are also more likely to have Celiac disease. This causes intestinal problems when they eat gluten, a protein in wheat.
• Hearing problems. Up to 75% of children with Down syndrome have problems with their hearing. They need regular hearing screenings and may need to have hearing problems corrected or use hearing aids.
• Vision problems. Some babies have eye problems, such as cataracts (cloudy lenses) or crossed eyes. Corrective lenses or surgery may be necessary to fix these problems.
• Down syndrome causes problems with the immune system that make it harder to fight infection. Your child may have colds, ear infections, and sinus infections more often than other children. Therefore, it’s important for children with Down syndrome to receive all of their recommended vaccines. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that people with Down syndrome are at a higher risk of contracting and having a poor outcome from COVID-19. As such, the CDC recommends all people with Down syndrome get vaccinated.
• Blood disorders. Those with Down syndrome are more likely to have blood problems. These could include anemia (low iron) and polycythemia (high levels of red blood cells). Children with Down syndrome are more likely to develop leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells).
• Premature aging. Adults with Down syndrome can develop health problems normally caused by aging. These include dementia, memory loss, high cholesterol, diabetes, cataracts, and early menopause.
• Learning disabilities. At birth, it isn’t possible to tell determine a baby’s IQ. Intelligence ranges from low normal to very slow to learn.","• Should I be tested when I’m pregnant to see if the baby has Down syndrome?

• Poor judgment
• Impulsive behavior
• Slow learning
• Delayed language and speech

While these kinds of problems are common, they are rarely severe.

• Trisomy 21. In this form, the cell division issue happens during the development of the sperm or the egg. This gives the child three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two copies. Up to 95% of people with Down syndrome have Trisomy 21.
• Mosaic Down syndrome. Some cells have an extra copy of chromosome 21 because of abnormal cell division in the embryo. This form is rare. Only 1% of Down syndrome cases are Mosaic.
• Translocation Down syndrome. Translocation (or shift) occurs before or at conception when part of chromosome 21 attaches onto another chromosome. It is the only form of Down syndrome that can be passed down from parent to child. This can happen even if the parent shows no symptoms of Down syndrome.

• Advanced maternal age. The older the woman is, the older her eggs are. Older eggs are more likely to divide abnormally. At age 35, your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is about 1 in 350. At age 40, the risk is 1 in 100. By age 45, your risk is 1 in 30.
• Already having a child with Down syndrome. If you have a baby with Down syndrome, you have a 1 in 100 chance of having another one.
• Being a carrier of a chromosomal abnormality. Both men and women can carry the translocation abnormality. If you are a carrier, you risk passing it on to your child.

An assistive device is any tool, technology, or piece of equipment that helps your child function more easily. This could include something as simple as a modified pencil that makes writing easier, a special touchscreen computer that allows your child to communicate or hearing aids.

Keep your child physically healthy. Provide therapy or treatment for his or her impairments. This will help them be better able to learn. With therapy, many children with Down syndrome grow up to have jobs and live independently. There are even post-secondary programs designed to give people with Down syndrome a college experience. This allows them to develop life skills through life in a dorm, to take specially designed classes and to train for employment in their communities."
116,Dysmenorrhea,https://familydoctor.org/condition/dysmenorrhea/,Dysmenorrhea is the medical term for pain that women have before or during menses (known as their period). It usually is not serious.,"Menstrual cramps can feel like a dull ache or a shooting pain. They most often occur in your low stomach. You may also feel them in your low back, hips, or thighs. The pain may start before your period or when your period begins. Menstrual cramps last about 1 to 3 days. The pain may be bad enough to keep you from normal activities.","There are two types of dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is pain caused by common menstrual cramps. Secondary dysmenorrhea is pain caused by a disease or condition. This could include:

• an infection
• ovarian cysts (fluid-filled sacs in your ovary)
• endometriosis (a problem with the lining of your uterus).","Most of the time, women do not need to see the doctor for menstrual cramps. This may be different if you have severe, lasting pain or pain that is new or different. In these cases, your doctor may want to do a physical exam, pelvic exam, or tests. These can help diagnose or rule out the cause of your pain. An ultrasound test lets your doctor see if you have ovarian cysts. A laparoscopy can check for endometriosis. In this minor surgery, the doctor makes a small cut in your low stomach. Then, they insert a thin tube to look inside your uterus.",Menstrual cramps and pain cannot be prevented or avoided.,"At-home treatment is available for women who have menstrual cramps. The goal is to relieve symptoms. Over-the-counter medicines can reduce pain. These include ibuprofen (brand names: Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (brand name: Aleve). Other medicines are Midol, Pamprin, and Premsyn PMS. You also can try using heating pads or taking a warm bath.

Talk to your doctor if these don’t help. They may suggest a stronger pain reliever. They may want you to try using birth control pills or a birth control shot. These can help make your periods less painful.","Menstrual cramps are painful but can be managed with treatment. Talk to your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:

• painful periods that start later in life
• pain at times other than the first couple days of your period
• abnormalvaginal discharge or bleeding
• pain that doesn’t go away when you take medicine to relieve it.","• Is the pain I have a normal part of my menstrual cycle?
• What can I do to treat and relieve my pain?
• Are there lifestyle changes I can make, such as diet or exercise, that will help?
• What should I do if my pain lasts or gets worse?
• Are there any health problems that are related to menstrual cramps?

117,Dyspareunia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/dyspareunia/,"Dyspareunia is painful sex for women. Also, it causes pain during tampon use. The pain can be felt in a woman’s genitals or deep inside her pelvis.","The pain may feel sharp, burning, or like menstrual cramps. Pain during sex may feel like it is coming from deep inside the pelvis. Women often report the feeling that something is being bumped into inside them.

Dyspareunia can have many causes, including.

• Infection (such as a yeast infection, urinary tract infection)
• Injury to the vagina
• Inflammation of the vagina. The inflammation can be so bad that wearing pants can cause pain.
• Poorly fitted diaphragm or cervical cap. These are methods of birth control.
• Muscle spasms around the vagina. For some women, the pain of the spasms is so severe that sexual intercourse is impossible.
• Vaginal dryness. This dryness may be caused by menopause and changes in estrogen levels. Estrogen is a hormone. It could also be from a lack of foreplay before intercourse.
• Abnormalities inside the uterus. These could include fibroid growth, if the uterus is tilted, or if the uterus prolapses (falls) into the vagina.
• Certain conditions or infections of the ovaries
• Past surgeries. This may leave scar tissue that can cause pain.
• Endometriosis (scar tissue outside the uterus unrelated to surgery)
• Pelvic inflammatory disease
• Being tense during sex or being unable to become aroused",null,"During a visit with your doctor, they will ask you to describe your pain, where it is located, and when it began. They may also ask you to describe what you have tried in the past to relieve the pain. For example:

• Have you tried a sexual lubricant or more foreplay?
• Is it painful every time you try to have sex?
• Are there other problems associated with sex?

Your doctor may want to examine your genital area or perform a pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, your doctor may apply a cotton-tipped swab to the area around the vagina to see if it is painful. Your doctor will examine your vagina and cervix using a tool called a speculum. This helps the doctor gently open the area for the exam. It is similar to the way you get a Pap smear. For some women, this part of the exam may be painful. Your doctor may use a smaller speculum to decrease the discomfort. Your doctor may also delay the exam until the pain has decreased. It is important to let your doctor know if the exam becomes too painful.

During the final part of the exam, your doctor will feel your uterus and ovaries with one hand on the abdomen and finger(s) in your vagina. This is similar to exams performed during a pelvic exam.

If your symptoms and exam suggest an infection, your doctor may take a sample from your vagina or cervix to send to the lab. A urine test is another possible test. Your doctor may order a pelvic sonogram, CT (computed tomography), or X-ray test to look inside your pelvis.","Depending on the cause of your dyspareunia, it could be prevented through treatment. For example, if it is caused by vaginal dryness or lack of foreplay, it can be prevented through the use of a sexual lubricant.","Treatments depend on what is causing your pain. They may include sexual lubricants (over-the-counter products), antibiotics for infections, a different type of birth control, or surgery.","Living with dyspareunia may be physically uncomfortable. However, it may affect your sexual relationship as well. Anticipating painful sex may cause you to avoid it. It may change the type of birth control you use (which may or may not be convenient for you).","• Could tampon use or overuse be causing my pain?
• Does childbirth cause the pain?
• Can hormone replacement therapy (HRT) help vaginal dryness?
• Can the pain be related to ovarian or cervical cancer?","Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Reproductive Health

118,Dysphagia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/dysphagia/,"Dysphagia is a swallowing disorder, which means it may be difficult to swallow. People who have dysphagia have trouble swallowing solid foods, liquids, or saliva. They may not be able to swallow at all. Dysphagia can make it hard to take in enough calories and fluids to keep your body working properly.

If you have dysphagia, you may have some of the following","symptoms:

• Pain while swallowing (odynophagia)
• Choking
• Feeling like something is stuck in your throat or chest
• Being hoarse
• Coughing up food
• Gagging or coughing when swallowing
• Bad breath
• Drooling
• Weight loss
• Frequent heartburn
• Dehydration
• Inhaling food (aspiration), which can lead to lung infections such as pneumonia

If you regularly have trouble swallowing or have these symptoms, call your family doctor. If food has gotten stuck and you’re having trouble breathing, call for emergency help right away.","Dysphagia can happen at any age, but it is more common in older people. Many different things can cause dysphagia:

• Poor eating habits.Eating too fast or taking large bites can cause dysphagia. It can also be caused by eating while lying down or not drinking enough water while eating. You may also experience dysphagia if you can’t chew properly because of painful or missing teeth or dentures.
• Nerve and muscle disorders.People who have had a stroke, or people who have Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or myasthenia gravis may have problems swallowing. These disorders can stop the nerves and muscles in your esophagus from working properly. The esophagus is the tube that runs from your mouth and throat down to your stomach. This can cause food to move slowly or even get stuck in the esophagus.
• Problems with the esophagus itself.For example, conditions like acid reflux can damage the esophagus and cause scar tissue to form. The scar tissue may narrow the opening of the esophagus and may result in dysphagia.
• You may also develop a pocket outside the esophagus. This is caused by weakness in the wall of your esophagus. This abnormal pocket traps some food being swallowed. Then, while you are lying down or sleeping, you might accidentally draw undigested food into your throat.
• Other disorders.Certain cancers, an enlarged thyroid, or an enlarged heart may put pressure on the esophagus and cause dysphagia.","Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms. They will probably ask you what foods or liquids you have trouble swallowing. They will want to know if you have pain when swallowing or frequent heartburn. Your doctor may also ask you if you’ve coughed or thrown up any blood. If your doctor decides you may have dysphagia, they may order tests to figure out what is causing it.

You may have a test called a barium swallow. During this test, you will drink a liquid that contains a small amount of barium. Then the doctor can watch it travel through your body on an X-ray machine. This test can show whether something is blocking your esophagus, or if another problem is causing your dysphagia.

You may also need an endoscopy. For this test, the doctor uses a flexible tube with a light at the end of it. They will look inside the esophagus, stomach, and the first part of the small intestine. The doctor may take a small sample of tissue (called a biopsy) to rule out cancer or other possible causes of your dysphagia. You will probably be given a sedative medicine. This should make you more relaxed and comfortable during the test. Your throat will also be numbed, so you shouldn’t feel pain when the tube is inserted. You may feel some irritation in your throat after the test and biopsy.","There isn’t anything you can do to prevent having swallowing difficulties. The best way to reduce your risk of occasionally having trouble swallowing is to eat slowly, eat small bites, and chew your food well. In addition, treating acid reflux early can help lower your risk of developing scar tissue in the throat.","Treatment for your dysphagia will depend on what is causing it.

If poor eating habits are the cause, your doctor may have you work with a speech pathologist to learn how to improve your ability to swallow. This could include chewing carefully or drinking more water while eating. Or you may need to change positions while swallowing. This could be as simple as turning your head at a different angle.

Your doctor may also work with you to find foods that are easier for you to swallow. You might need to do exercises to strengthen your swallowing muscles, such as your tongue and your esophagus.

Sometimes, medicine or other treatments may be used to treat the cause of dysphagia. For example, if your dysphagia is caused by heartburn, your doctor might suggest taking an antacid or acid reducer before every meal. If you have a muscle problem causing dysphasia, a medicine called botulinum toxin may be used to relax throat muscles. This will make swallowing easier.

Sometimes dysphagia is caused by a tumor or something else blocking the esophagus. You may need surgery to treat these problems. For some people, surgery won’t help. They would need a feeding tube in the stomach to make sure they are getting the foods and fluids they need.","Dysphagia can lead to complications. These include:

• Malnutrition, weight loss, and dehydration. When you have trouble swallowing, it can be hard to get all of the fluids and nourishment you need.
• When you try to swallow, sometimes food or liquid may accidentally enter your airway. When this food or liquid goes into your lungs, it can introduce bacteria that causes pneumonia. This is called aspiration pneumonia. Pneumonia is a serious illness, especially in older people.
• If food gets stuck in your throat, you may choke. If it completely blocks the airway, you won’t be able to breathe and you could die.","• Are there lifestyle changes I can make that will help dysphagia?
• Are there medicines that treat dysphagia, and do they have side effects?
• Will I need surgery? Are there other options?
• Is dysphagia a sign of another health condition?
• Can you show me some swallowing techniques or exercises that may improve dysphagia?","National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders: Dysphagia

119,E. coli Infection,https://familydoctor.org/condition/e-coli-infection/,"E. coli is short for Escherichia coli—bacteria (germs) that are found on food and in the environment. E. coli cause severe cramps and diarrhea. These bacteria are a leading cause of bloody diarrhea. The symptoms are worse in children and older people, and especially in people who have another illness. E. coli infection is more common during the summer months and in northern states.","Symptoms can start from 1 to 10 days after you’re exposed to the germ. The first symptoms are severe abdominal cramps that start suddenly. After a few hours, watery diarrhea starts. The diarrhea causes your body to lose fluids and electrolytes (dehydration). This makes you feel sick and tired. The watery diarrhea lasts for about a day and then may change to bright red bloody stools. The infection makes sores in your intestines, so the stools become bloody. The bloody diarrhea may last for 2 to 5 days. You might have 10 or more bowel movements a day. Some people say their stools are “all blood and no stool.” You may have a mild fever or no fever. You may also have nausea or vomiting. If you have any of these symptoms—watery, bloody diarrhea, cramps, fever, nausea, or vomiting—try to get to your doctor right away.","Most E. coli infections come from:

• Eating undercooked ground beef (the inside is pink)
• Drinking contaminated (impure) water
• Drinking unpasteurized (raw) milk
• Working with cattle
• Eating food contaminated with animal feces (such as vegetables)

Healthy beef and dairy cattle may carry the E. coli germ in their intestines. The meat can get contaminated with the germ during the slaughtering process. When beef is ground up, the E. coli germs get mixed throughout the meat. That is why it is important to make sure ground meat is cooked all the way through. For beef steaks, a pink middle is still OK.

The most common way to get this infection is by eating contaminated food. You can be infected with the E. coli germ if you don’t use a high temperature to cook your beef, or if you don’t cook it long enough. When you eat undercooked ground beef, the germs go into your stomach and intestines.

The germ also can be passed from person to person in daycare centers and nursing homes. If you have this infection and don’t wash your hands well with soap after going to the bathroom, you can give the germ to other people when you touch things, especially food.

People who are infected with E. coli are very contagious. Children shouldn’t go to a daycare center until they have 2 negative stool cultures (proof that the infection is gone). Older people in nursing homes should stay in bed until 2 stool cultures are negative.","The diagnosis is made by finding E. coli in a stool culture. If you have bloody diarrhea, see your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor will do a culture to find out if you have E. coli in your intestines. The culture has to be taken in the first 48 hours after the bloody diarrhea starts.","You can help prevent this infection by handling and cooking meat in a safe way. For your protection, follow these rules:

• Wash your hands carefully with soap before you start cooking and after.
• Cook ground beef until you see no pink anywhere.
• Don’t taste small bites of raw ground beef while you’re cooking.
• Don’t put cooked hamburgers on a plate that had raw ground beef on it before.
• Cook all hamburgers to at least 155°F. A meat thermometer can help you test your hamburgers.
• Defrost meats in the refrigerator or the microwave. Don’t let meat sit on the counter to defrost.
• Keep raw meat and poultry separate from other foods. Use hot water and soap to wash cutting boards and dishes if raw meat and poultry have touched them.
• Don’t drink raw milk.
• Keep food refrigerated or frozen.
• Keep hot food hot and cold food cold.
• Wash all fruits and vegetables, especially if eaten raw.
• Refrigerate leftovers right away or throw them away.
• People with diarrhea should wash their hands carefully and often, using hot water and soap, and washing for at least 30 seconds. People who work in daycare centers and homes for the elderly should wash their hands often, too. Using hand sanitizer is often not enough to kill the coli, so proper handwashing is absolutely necessary.

In restaurants, always order hamburgers that are cooked well done so that no pink shows.","There is no special treatment, except drinking a lot of water and watching for complications. Don’t take medicine to stop diarrhea unless your doctor tells you to do so. This medicine would keep your intestines from getting rid of the E. coli germ. If you are seriously dehydrated, you might need to go to the hospital to have fluids put into your veins with an IV.","As you are managing E. coli at home, get plenty of bed rest. Rest promotes recovery. Drink plenty of fluids to keep from being dehydrated. Stick to clear liquids and avoid drinks that have caffeine or alcohol. When you feel you are able to eat, start slowly. Try some crackers or toast. If that sets well, begin to add in other foods, but nothing too high in fiber for a while. Most people will be better in 6 to 8 days.","• How do I know what caused an coli infection?

120,Ear Infection | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ear-infection/,"An ear infection is one of the most common conditions among children. It is caused by a viral or bacterial infection. These infections create pressure in the Eustachian tube that connects the throat to the middle ear. This pressure causes the ear pain.

A chronic ear infection can last for 6 weeks or more, but most infections are viral and go away on their own after 3 days without needing to see a doctor. Children are more likely to get an ear infection when they’re exposed to illness from other kids, especially during the winter months. Babies who drink from a bottle while lying down are likely to get the infections, too.","Intense pain in your child’s ear is usually the first sign of an ear infection. Young children can tell you that their ear hurts, but babies may only cry. Your child may repeatedly pull on the ear that hurts. The pain is usually worse at night and when your child is chewing, sucking a bottle, or lying down. That’s when the pressure is at its greatest. Other symptoms include a runny nose, cough, fever, vomiting, or dizziness, and hearing loss.

They are caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The infection creates pressure in the Eustachian tube. This tube does not work properly when filled with drainage from the nose or mucous from allergies, colds, bacteria, or viruses.

A child’s adenoids (the little bits of tissue that hang above the tonsils at the back of the throat) sometimes can block the opening of Eustachian tubes because they are larger in young children.","Your doctor will check for an ear infection by using a small scope with a light to look into your child’s ear. They will know if the eardrum is infected if it looks red. Other signs of infection they may see include fluid in the ear or a ruptured eardrum—which leaves a hole. Your doctor will also look for other symptoms in your child, such as a runny nose, cough, fever, vomiting, and dizziness.","Although an ear infection is not contagious, the bacteria or virus that caused it is often contagious. It’s important to:

• Vaccinate your child with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to protect against several types of pneumococcal bacteria. This type of bacteria is the most common cause of ear infections. Get your child’s vaccinations on time.
• Practice routine hand washing and avoid sharing food and drinks, especially if your child is exposed to large groups of kids in day care or school settings.
• Avoid second-hand smoke.
• Breastfeed your baby exclusively for the first 6 months and continue breastfeeding for at least 1 year. Place your baby at an angle while feeding.

Common allergy and cold medicines do not protect against ear infections.","Ear infections need to be treated. If left untreated, they can lead to unnecessary pain and permanent hearing loss for your child.

Ear infections usually go away in a few days. Your doctor will likely treat your child’s pain and fever with over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers or eardrops. If your child isn’t better in a few days after treatment starts, you may need to take them back to the doctor. At that point, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if the infection is caused by bacteria.

Doctors are cautious about prescribing antibiotics for ear infections unless they are chronic and frequent. Research shows that over prescribing antibiotics for ear infections is not effective. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends doctors wait 2 to 3 days before prescribing antibiotics for an ear infection in children 2 to 12 years of age who have non-severe symptoms. This allows time to see if the OTC medicines will work.

If your child has chronic ear infections, signs of hearing loss, or speech delays because of hearing loss, your doctor may refer you to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor. The ENT may suggest your child have surgery. During this surgery, the ENT inserts tubes inside your child’s middle ear. The tubes relieve the pressure and allow the fluid to drain. Some children naturally have small Eustachian tubes, so this helps correct that problem. As your child’s ears grow and develop, the tubes fall out and the ear infections are no longer a problem. Sometimes, the tubes fall out too soon and have to be replaced. For some children, they never fall out and eventually have to be surgically removed. The surgery is quick and does not require overnight hospitalization.

Your doctor also may recommend this surgery if your child has frequent ear infections, or if your child has Down syndrome, a cleft palate or a weakened immune system.","If your child suffers from several ear infections each year, you’ll want to look out for symptoms every time they have a stuffy nose or congestion.

Never stick anything in your child’s ear to relieve the pain of an ear infection, to remove the tubes or remove a foreign object. See your child’s doctor to have it removed.","• How can I keep my child comfortable at night with the pain of an ear infection?

121,Early Pregnancy Loss,https://familydoctor.org/condition/early-pregnancy-loss/,"An early pregnancy loss is known as a miscarriage. This represents any pregnancy that ends on its own in the first 20 weeks of gestation.

Experts estimate that 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.

There are several classifications of miscarriage:

• Complete – when the embryo and surrounding tissues have emptied out of the uterus. It typically involves cramping and bleeding. These resolve quickly, usually in a few days to a week.
• Incomplete or inevitable – when the cervix opens, and some tissue is expelled (released). The embryo or tissue may not completely leave the uterus. This can cause continued pain and bleeding.
• Missed – when the embryo has died, but it stays in the uterus. You may have no idea that it has happened. It is often discovered when pregnancy symptoms stop, or an ultrasound shows no heartbeat.
• Threatened – when you experience some bleeding and cramping, but the cervix remains closed. A miscarriage may or may not happen.
• Recurrent –when you have 3 or more miscarriages in your first trimester.","The most common symptoms of miscarriage are bleeding and cramping. But they don’t necessarily mean you’re having a miscarriage. Up to one-third of pregnancies come with some bleeding early on. About half of those result in normal pregnancies. If you have any bleeding or cramping in your first trimester, call your doctor.

There are other common signs that indicate you may be having a miscarriage. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away:

• Mild to severe back pain (worse than menstrual cramps)
• Weight loss
• White-pink mucus discharge from the vagina
• Contractions (painful, happening every 5 to 20 minutes)
• Tissue that looks like a clot passing from the vagina
• Sudden decrease in signs of pregnancy","• Chemical pregnancy – This is a very early miscarriage. It usually happens in the first few weeks after conception. Chromosomal abnormalities keep the embryo from developing normally. The tissue is passed from your uterus around the same time that you normally have your period. Many women don’t even know they are pregnant when they have a miscarriage from a chemical pregnancy.
• Blighted ovum –This is also called an embryonic pregnancy. It happens when the fertilized egg implants in the wall of the uterus, but a fetus never develops.
• Ectopic pregnancy –This is when the fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the uterus. Often, it implants in the fallopian tube. This can cause serious problems for the mother. Treatment — usually surgery — is needed right away to remove the tissue. This is never a viable pregnancy.
• Molar pregnancy –This is a rare problem that starts with a genetic error during fertilization. This causes abnormal tissue to grow instead of an embryo. It is not a viable pregnancy. But it still causes regular pregnancy symptoms. These include a missed period, positive pregnancy test, and nausea.

In some cases, the cause of your pregnancy loss is unknown. Often, it is a random problem with chromosomes that happens at conception. You might be afraid that you did something that caused your miscarriage. But things like working, exercising, having sex, or morning sickness do not cause miscarriage. Any kind of fall or blow is rarely to blame. The research on the effects of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine is unclear. So, there is nothing you could have done to prevent it. It is not the result of anything you did or didn’t do. You should never blame yourself for a miscarriage.

Patients who are pregnant and who have had a miscarriage are at greater risk of having another one. Your risk also increases as you get older. You are at highest risk when you are age 35 or older. Some medical conditions also increase your risk. These include:

• Diabetes
• Thyroid disease
• Polycystic ovary syndrome.
• Problems with the immune system

Even if you have one of these conditions, you can’t do anything to avoid having a miscarriage. Many patients who are pregnant and have these health conditions have healthy pregnancies.","Your doctor will start by asking you questions about your symptoms and when they started. They will do a physical exam. Your doctor might do an ultrasound. This can reveal if the embryo is still growing, and it can check for a heartbeat. They may also order blood tests. These can measure pregnancy hormone levels. This can give your doctor an idea if you are losing the pregnancy.","There is no conclusive research that says there is anything you can do to prevent a miscarriage. You didn’t cause it, so you couldn’t have prevented it.","There are two main types of treatment for miscarriage: non-surgical and surgical.

In many cases, your body passes all of the pregnancy tissue naturally. This could take a few days up to a few weeks. No treatment is needed. If it is taking a long time, your doctor can give you medicine that can help pass the tissue.

The process of passing the tissue can involve heavy bleeding, cramping pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Your doctor may give you pain medicine to help ease your symptoms. If you are in your first trimester, the tissue will be small. It will look like a blood clot. It will not look like a baby.

Your doctor may do an ultrasound or blood tests after you are finished with the miscarriage. This will confirm that the miscarriage is complete, and no tissue remains.

Surgical treatment is usually done if there are complications with your miscarriage.

• An infection
• Heavy bleeding
• Any condition that keeps pregnancy tissue inside your uterus

• Vacuum aspiration.In this procedure, a thin tube is inserted into your uterus. It is connected to a suction device. The pregnancy tissue is suctioned out of your body. The procedure is done under local anesthesia. Your doctor can perform it in his or her office.
• Dilation and curettage (D&C).This procedure opens the cervix and uses an instrument to remove the pregnancy tissue. It is usually done under regional or general anesthesia. Your doctor will perform it in a hospital or surgery center.

After treatment, your doctor may recommend you not put anything into your vagina for a few weeks. This includes using tampons and having sex. This helps prevent infection.

• Heavy bleeding
• Fever
• Chills
• Severe pain

Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms.","Everyone handles loss differently. Some patients who are pregnant may have trouble coping with the feelings that can go along with miscarriage. If you are very upset or feel like you need help, there are resources available. Talk to your doctor. They may be able to refer you to a local support group. There are also national resources you can access, such as SHARE: Pregnancy and Infant Loss Support. It lists local support groups and offers online resources that could help you.","• I’m having symptoms of miscarriage. What are the chances that I will miscarry?

122,Eating Disorders,https://familydoctor.org/condition/eating-disorders/,"An eating disorder is a mental health condition. It is an obsession with food and weight that harms a person’s emotional and physical well-being and interferes with their everyday life. Many people worry about their weight. However, people who have an eating disorder go to extremes to keep from gaining weight. The 3 most common eating disorders are:

• Anorexia nervosa
• Bulimia
• Binge eating

Anorexia nervosa (often shortened to anorexia) is an illness that usually occurs in teenage girls. It also can occur in teenage boys, and in adult women and men. People who have anorexia are obsessed with being thin. They don’t want to eat. They may try to hide their eating disorder by pretending to have eaten. They are afraid of gaining weight. They may constantly worry about how many calories they consume or how much fat is in their food. They may take diet pills, laxatives, or water pills to lose weight. They may exercise too much.

People who have anorexia usually think they’re fat even though they’re very thin. They may get so thin that they look like they’re sick. Anorexia isn’t just a problem with food or weight. It’s an attempt to use control over food and weight to deal with emotional problems.

People who have anorexia may feel cold all the time, and they may get sick often. They are often in a bad mood. They have a hard time concentrating and are always thinking about food. It is not true that anorexics are never hungry. They are always hungry. Feeling hunger gives them a feeling of control over their lives and their bodies. It makes them feel like they are good at something—they are good at losing weight. People who have severe anorexia may be at risk of death from starvation.

Bulimia is eating an unusual amount of food at once (called bingeing), and then getting rid of it. This includes throwing up or using laxatives to remove the food from the body (called purging). After a binge, some bulimics fast (don’t eat) or over-exercise to keep from gaining weight. People who have bulimia may also use water pills, laxatives, or diet pills to “control” their weight. People who have bulimia often try to hide their bingeing and purging. They may hide food for binges. People who have bulimia are usually close to normal weight, but their weight may go up and down.

Binge eating disorder is eating an excessive amount of food at once and not purging it. People who have a binge eating disorder are typically overweight or have obesity. It is the most common eating disorder in the U.S.

The following are possible warning","signs of anorexia and bulimia:

• Unnatural concern about body weight (even if the person is not overweight)
• Obsession with calories, fat grams, and food
• Using any medicines to keep from gaining weight (diet pills, laxatives, water pills)
• Eating large amounts of food at one setting (and being overweight or having obesity)
• Physical complications, such as declining dental health, hair, skin, and nail disorders, heart problems and other conditions that arise from poor nutrition

More serious warning signs may be harder to notice because people who have an eating disorder are skilled at keeping it a secret. Watch for these signs:

• Throwing up after meals
• Fainting with no explanation
• Increased anxiety about weight
• Calluses or scars on the knuckle (from forced throwing up)
• Dental breakdown
• Denying that there is anything wrong

• Deliberate self-starvation with weight loss
• Fear of gaining weight
• Refusal to eat or skipping meals
• Denial of hunger
• Wearing baggy clothes
• Constant exercising
• Greater amounts of hair on the body or the face
• Sensitivity to cold temperatures
• Absent or irregular periods in girls or women
• Loss of scalp hair
• A self-perception of being fat when the person is actually too thin

• Eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as a 2-hour period
• Eating even when you’re full or not hungry
• Eating fast while bingeing
• Eating until you’re painfully full or sick
• Eating alone or in secret because you’re embarrassed
• Feeling stressed, ashamed, or guilty when bingeing
• Trying to diet on occasion without success","Doctors don’t know exactly. Possible causes include genetic, environmental, peer pressure, and emotional health. Certain risk factors contribute to an eating disorder, including:

• Gender (women and girls are more likely to be diagnosed than men and boys)
• Family history
• Dieting
• Life changes",Eating disorders are most often diagnosed by examining physical health as well as mental health. Your doctor will evaluate your eating habits and order tests to help determine a diagnosis. They will also likely refer you to a mental health provider for evaluation.,"There is no known way to prevent eating disorders. The reason some people develop eating disorders isn’t known. People who have anorexia may believe they would be happier and more successful if they were thin. They want everything in their lives to be perfect. People who have this disorder are usually good students. They are involved in many school and community activities. They blame themselves if they don’t get perfect grades, or if other things in life are not perfect.","Most of the time, eating disorders are treated with a combination of prescription medicine (anti-depressants, anti-anxiety), talk therapy, and nutritional counseling.

If you’re malnourished or very thin, you may be admitted to the hospital to treat the serious side effects of an eating disorder. Your doctor will probably want you to see a dietitian to learn how to pick healthy foods and eat at regular times. Family and individual counseling (talking about your feelings about your weight and problems in your life) is helpful for people who have eating disorders.

For people who have anorexia, the first step is getting back to a normal weight. Treatment of anorexia is difficult, because people who have anorexia believe there is nothing wrong with them. Patients in the early stages of anorexia (less than 6 months or with just a small amount of weight loss) may be successfully treated without having to be admitted to the hospital. But for successful treatment, patients must want to change and must have family and friends to help them.

People who have more severe anorexia need care in the hospital, usually in a special unit for people who have anorexia and bulimia. Treatment involves more than changing the person’s eating habits. Anorexic patients often need counseling for a year or more so they can work on changing the feelings that are causing their eating problems. These feelings may be about their weight, family problems, or problems with self-esteem. Some anorexic patients are helped by taking medicine that makes them feel less depressed.","It’s healthy to watch what you eat and to exercise. What isn’t healthy is worrying all the time about your weight and what you eat. People who have eating disorders do harmful things to their bodies because of their obsession about their weight. If it isn’t treated, anorexia can cause the following health problems:

• Stomach problems
• Heart problems
• Irregular periods or no periods
• Fine hair all over the body, including the face
• Dry, scaly skin
• Poor dental health

If it isn’t treated, bulimia can cause the following health problems:

• Stomach problems
• Heart problems
• Kidney problems
• Dental problems (from throwing up stomach acid).
• Dehydration (not enough water in the body).

If it isn’t treated, binge eating can lead to multiple health conditions, including:

• Heart disease
• Diabetes
• High blood pressure","• What treatment is best for me?

People who have anorexia feel safe, secure, and comfortable with their illness. Their biggest fear is gaining weight, and gaining weight is seen as loss of control. They may deny they have a problem.

123,Ebola Virus Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ebola-virus-disease/,"Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a rare but serious disease caused by infection by the Ebola virus. There are five known strains of the virus. Four of them affect people. One affects only nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees) and pigs.

EVD was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). In 2014, large outbreaks occurred in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 11 people were treated in the U.S. during the 2014-2016 epidemic and one person died. EVD is still an ongoing situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with reoccurring outbreaks.","Symptoms of EVD often begin 8 to 10 days after a person is infected with the virus. The virus cannot be spread to another person until symptoms appear.

• Fatigue
• Fever
• Muscle pain
• Headache
• Weakness

• Nausea
• Diarrhea
• Stomach pain
• Unexplained bruising or bleeding, such as a bloody nose, bloodshot eyes, or bloody urine or diarrhea","EVD is caused by the Ebola virus. It’s origin or how it started is unknown. Scientists believe that it is animal-borne and most likely comes from bats, which transmit the virus to other animals and humans. There is no proof that mosquitos or other insects can transmit the virus. Once infected, a person can spread the virus to other people.

The Ebola virus is not as contagious as common viruses, such as colds or the flu. It is not spread through air, water, or food. The virus is spread through direct contact with:

• Blood of a person infected with the virus
• Body fluids, such as breast milk, stool, saliva, semen, sweat, urine, or vomit, of a person infected with the virus
• Objects, such as needles or syringes, that are contaminated with the virus
• Animals, such as bats and primates, that are infected with the virus

Direct contact means that a person’s eye, mouth, nose, or broken skin touches contaminated blood, fluids, or an object. Broken skin may be a cut, scratch, scrape, or open wound.

For most people, the risk of being infected with the Ebola virus is extremely low. The risk increases if you:

• Travel to an area where known EVD outbreaks have occurred
• Help take care of someone infected with the virus
• Have direct contact with a person infected with the virus. Even an infected dead body can still spread the virus","Tell your doctor about your symptoms and risk factors (for example, all recent travel). You must have symptoms of EVD and have had possible exposure to EVD to be diagnosed with it. Your doctor can do a blood test to confirm if you have been infected","If you are diagnosed with EVD, you will be put in isolation right away to prevent the virus from spreading. Can Ebola virus disease be prevented or avoided. The is a vaccine to help prevent EBD in people who are 18 years old and older. It is called ERVEBO and can help protect you from getting one type of Ebola virus. It will not protect you from all types of Ebola virus. Even if you get the vaccine, you should still try to not be exposed to Ebola virus. It is rare for people in the United States or other developed countries to get infected. You can help lower your risk of infection by doing the following: • Avoid traveling to areas where known EVD outbreaks have occurred. • Do not touch the blood or body fluids of a person who may be infected with the virus. • Do not touch the body of a person who has died from EVD. • Do not touch items that may be contaminated with the virus. People who work in health care settings should be extra cautious around those who are infected or at risk of being infected with the Ebola virus. Call your doctor right away if you are at increased risk of being infected and you have symptoms of EVD. Avoid contact with other people until you get medical care.","Currently, there is no medicine to treat EVD. Some experimental medicines are being tested.

The main goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms. Options may include:

• Getting fluids to prevent dehydration
• Regulating and replacing salts and other chemicals in the body
• Maintaining blood pressure
• Taking medicine to relieve fever, diarrhea, nausea, and pain
• Getting oxygen
• Treating other infections

Close supervision and care by health care professionals is very important. A patient with EVD may need intensive care unit (ICU) services.

Living with Ebola virus disease

Overall, EVD leads to death in about half of people who become infected. People who recover from EVD may still be contagious. The Ebola virus can remain in certain body fluids for some time. For example, men can spread the virus through their semen for up to 3 months after their symptoms first appear. They should not have sex, including oral sex, during this time. The virus also can remain in breast milk, amniotic fluid, eye fluid, and spinal column fluid.

Ebola survivors may have lasting side effects from the virus. These could include fatigue, muscle aches, stomach pain, and eye problems.",null,"• How do I know if my symptoms are related to Ebola virus disease?

124,Echinococcosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/echinococcosis/,"Echinococcosis is a type of infection caused by parasites. It occurs when you eat food or water that is contaminated with eggs of the Echinococcus. This is a microscopic tapeworm that is found in dogs, sheep, other livestock, and wild animals.

The tapeworm settles in your organs, such as your lungs, liver, or brain. It causes large cysts to form over time. There are two main forms of the infection: cystic echinococcosis (known as hydatid disease) and alveolar echinococcosis. Although infections in humans are rare, they can be serious.","Echinococcosis may not produce symptoms for up to 10 or 20 years. This is because the cysts grow slowly. Symptoms can include:

• stomach pain
• chest pain
• lasting cough
• unplanned weight loss
• weakness
• jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes)
• fever
• bloody stools
• headaches
• seizures.","The disease can be found all over the world. Primarily, it occurs in places where humans are in close contact with livestock or dogs. In the United States, echinococcosis mostly is found in the Southwest and Alaska.

Infected animals, such as dogs or sheep, pass the disease to humans. We can get it directly by consuming food or drink contaminated with feces. Or we can get it indirectly by playing with or handling infected animals.","First, the doctor will review your symptoms and do an exam. Second, they will perform tests to check for cysts. An X-ray often finds the cysts. The doctor also can do a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. If the doctor finds cysts, they may do a biopsy. This involves using a thin needle to puncture the cyst. Then, the doctor collects and tests fluid from the cyst to check for the echinococcosis infection.","Be careful if you live in an area near livestock and/or you have contact with dogs. There are things you can do to help prevent echinococcosis.

• Give your dogs routine deworming treatments to remove and prevent tapeworms.
• Consider giving vaccines to your sheep.
• Always wash your hands after handling animals.
• Fence in your house or garden to keep out wild animals.
• Avoid contact with stray dogs and wild animals.
• Wash all fruits and vegetables before eating them.","Treatment for echinococcosis varies. It depends on your symptoms and the location of cysts. Drugs that treat infections cause by worms are called anthelmintics.

The doctor can kill the tapeworm using injections. Once the tapeworm is gone, you may need to take medicine to keep it from coming back. Another form of treatment is injections to remove the cysts. Severe cases may require surgery to remove the cysts.","It is important to get treatment for echinococcosis once you start having symptoms. If left untreated, you could die from the disease.","• Should I wear gloves when playing with my dog or picking up feces?
• Is it okay to have my dog sleep with me?
• How often should I give my dog deworming treatments?
• I work with livestock. Should I be tested for echinococcosis?

125,Ectopic Pregnancy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ectopic-pregnancy/,"An ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus.

In a normal pregnancy, a fertilized egg implants and grows in the uterus (also called the womb). In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg doesn’t make it to the uterus. It implants somewhere else, most often in the fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. It can also occur in the ovary, cervix, or abdomen.

An ectopic pregnancy can be dangerous for the mother. As the pregnancy grows, it could cause the organ it is implanted in to rupture (burst). This can cause major internal bleeding. That’s why it is important to find an ectopic pregnancy in its early stages.","The early signs of an ectopic pregnancy are like those of a normal pregnancy:

• Missed periods
• Tender breasts
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Fatigue
• Frequent urination
• A positive home pregnancy test

The first warning signs of ectopic pregnancy may include:

• Abnormal vaginal bleeding
• Low back pain
• Mild pain in the abdomen or pelvis
• Mild cramping on one side of the pelvis

If you have any of these symptoms, you should call your doctor.

As an ectopic pregnancy grows, it may rupture. Then you may experience more serious symptoms. These could include:

• Sudden, severe pain in the abdomen or pelvis
• Shoulder pain
• Feeling weak, faint, or dizzy

If you experience these symptoms, get medical help right away.","Usually, an ectopic pregnancy happens because the fertilized egg couldn’t move down the fallopian tube quickly enough. An infection or inflammation in the tube can cause it to be partially or completely blocked. This is commonly caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Another common reason tubes get blocked is endometriosis. This is when cells from the lining of the uterus grow outside the uterus. The cells can grow inside the fallopian tube and cause blockages. Scar tissue from previous abdominal surgery or fallopian tube surgery can also block the tube.

Any pregnancy can be an ectopic pregnancy. But you’re more likely to have one if you:

• Are older than 35 years of age
• Have had infections (such as pelvic inflammatory disease) or operations in the pelvic area
• Have endometriosis
• Are using assisted reproductive methods to become pregnant, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF)
• Smoke
• Have a history of inflammation of the fallopian tubes or abnormally shaped fallopian tubes
• Have had trouble getting pregnant or have had fertility treatment
• Have had an ectopic pregnancy in the past","Ectopic pregnancies can be hard to diagnose because the first symptoms are the same as those of a normal pregnancy. If your doctor thinks you may have an ectopic pregnancy, they may do the following:

• Perform a pelvic exam to check the size and shape of your uterus.
• Order a urine test and a blood test to check your levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This is a hormone that is produced by the placenta. If you have an ectopic pregnancy, you may have a low hCG level.
• Perform a transvaginal ultrasound. During this procedure, a wand is inserted into your vagina. Sound waves from the wand make pictures of organs in the body. This will allow your doctor to see where the pregnancy is growing.","You can’t prevent an ectopic pregnancy, but you can try to control your risk factors. Don’t smoke. If you do smoke, plan on quitting before you get pregnant. Before getting pregnant, use a condom when having sex. This can help prevent sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, which can cause PID.

If you’re at higher risk of having an ectopic pregnancy, talk to your doctor. They may take extra steps to detect an ectopic pregnancy early. This could include checking your hormone levels or scheduling an early sonogram.","If a pregnancy is ectopic, the egg can’t develop. The ectopic tissue must be removed. This can be done with medicine or surgery.

If an ectopic pregnancy is discovered early, your doctor can give you a shot of medicine called methotrexate. This medicine stops cells from growing and ends the pregnancy. Your body then absorbs the ectopic tissue.

Some ectopic pregnancies require surgery. These include those that aren’t discovered early enough, or that cause a pelvic organ to rupture. Surgery is usually done with laparoscopy. This procedure uses a tiny camera that is inserted into your body through small cuts in your abdomen. Special tools are used to remove the pregnancy. If your fallopian tube or another organ has burst, your doctor may remove that, as well.

Whether you’re treated with medicine or surgery, your doctor will want to see you regularly afterward. They will monitor your hCG levels to make sure they go back to normal. This can take several weeks.","Whether you’re treated with medicine or surgery, your recovery may take several weeks. You may feel tired and have abdominal pain or discomfort. You also might still feel pregnant for a while. It takes a while for the hCG levels in your body to drop. It will probably take a few cycles before your periods go back to normal.

If you’ve had an ectopic pregnancy, you’re more likely to have another one. You also may have trouble getting pregnant again. You should give yourself time to heal before you try to get pregnant after having an ectopic pregnancy.

Having an ectopic pregnancy can be emotionally hard. You may feel sad, angry, and confused. Talk about your feelings with your partner, a trusted family member, or friend. Allow yourself the chance to Find a family member or friend you can talk to about your feelings. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of a pregnancy.","• Could vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy be a sign of ectopic pregnancy?
• Where is my ectopic pregnancy located?
• What treatment do I need?
• Will I need surgery?
• I’m having a hard time dealing with my feelings. Is there someone I could talk to or a support group in my area?
• I’d like to get pregnant again. Is there anything I can do to minimize my risk of having another ectopic pregnancy?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Ectopic Pregnancy

126,Eczema and Atopic Dermatitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/eczema-and-atopic-dermatitis/,"Eczema is a general term for rash-like skin conditions. The most common type of eczema is called atopic dermatitis. Eczema is often very itchy. When you scratch it, your skin becomes red and inflamed (puffy).

Eczema is most common in babies but also affects children and adults. Moderate to severe eczema in infants puts a baby at higher risk for developing a peanut allergy. As such, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases guidelines say that introducing small amounts of peanut foods to children as early as 4 to 6 months may prevent the allergy. It’s important to talk to your family doctor before introducing this food.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition. It is caused by an allergic reaction. It is the most common type of eczema. “Atopic” describes an inherited tendency to develop dermatitis, asthma, and hay fever. “Dermatitis” means that the skin is red and itchy. Atopic dermatitis usually starts during infancy and continues into childhood.

There are times when the condition gets worse (called flare-ups). Flare-ups are followed by times when the skin will heal. During these times, there may be no signs of atopic dermatitis (called remission). Remission can last for weeks, months, or even years. Some children will outgrow atopic dermatitis. Others will still have it when they are adults. Flare-ups in adults tend to be less severe.","Atopic dermatitis and eczema may start out as dry, extremely itchy skin. The rash may become very red, swollen, and sore. The more you scratch it, the worse it generally gets. A clear fluid may leak from the rash. Eventually, the rash will crust over and start to scale. Common places for the rash are in the elbow creases, behind the knees, on the cheeks, and on the buttocks.",You are more likely to have atopic dermatitis or eczema if a family member has it. These conditions aren’t contagious. This means you can’t catch them from other people. The exact cause of eczema and atopic dermatitis is unknown.,"Your doctor will be able to diagnose eczema simply by looking. As part of your exam, they will also review your medical history. It is important to tell your doctor if you have allergies or asthma. They may order blood and skin patch tests to rule out other conditions.","You may never know what causes your eczema or atopic dermatitis. Without knowing, you can’t avoid them. They can’t be cured, but they can be managed. You can also learn to avoid the things that trigger them.

Too much heat and sweat can irritate your skin and cause it to itch. Try to avoid activities that make you hot and sweaty.","Bathe only with a mild unscented soap, such as Dove, Basis, or Olay. Use a small amount of soap. Keep the water temperature cool or warm, not hot. Soaking in the tub for a short time can be good for your skin. Doing so allows your skin’s outer layer to absorb water and become less dry. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Then use a soft towel to pat your skin dry without rubbing. Immediately after drying, apply a moisturizer to your skin. This helps seal in the moisture.

Your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream or ointment to apply to your rash. This will help reduce itching and calm inflammation. Use it right after bathing. Follow your doctor’s directions for using this medicine or check the label for proper use. Call your doctor if your skin does not get better with regular use of the medicine.

Antihistamines like hydroxyzine reduce itching. They can help make it easier to not scratch. A new class of drugs, called immunomodulators, works well if you have a severe rash. Two drugs in this class are tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. These drugs keep your immune system from overreacting when stimulated by an allergen. However, they can affect your immune system. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that these drugs be used only when other treatments don’t work.

Try not to scratch the irritated area on your skin, even if it itches. Scratching can break the skin. Bacteria can enter these breaks and cause infection. Moisturizing your skin will help prevent itchiness.","Eczema can flare up when you are under stress. Learn how to recognize and cope with stress. Stress reduction techniques can help. Changing your activities to reduce daily stress can also be helpful.

The area where you had the eczema may easily get irritated again, so it needs special care. Continue to follow the tips provided here even after your skin has healed.","• What treatment is best for me?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Some things that may irritate your skin include:

• Household cleansers
• Detergents
• Aftershave lotions
• Gasoline
• Turpentine and other solvents

Try to avoid contact with things that make you break out with eczema. Soaps and wetness can cause skin irritation. Wash your hands only when necessary. Use a mild unscented soap such as Dove, Basis, or Olay, especially if you have eczema on your hands. Dry your hands completely after you wash them.

Wear vinyl or plastic gloves for work that requires you to have your hands in water. Also, wear gloves when your hands are exposed to anything that can irritate your skin. Wear cotton gloves under plastic gloves to soak up sweat from your hands. Take occasional breaks and remove your gloves. This will prevent a buildup of sweat inside your gloves.

Wear gloves when you go outside during the winter. Cold air and low humidity can dry your skin. Dryness can make your eczema worse. Wear clothes made of cotton or a cotton blend. Wool and some synthetic fabrics can irritate your skin.

Moisturizers help keep your skin soft and flexible. They prevent skin cracks. A plain moisturizer is best. Avoid moisturizers with fragrances (perfume) and a lot of extra ingredients. A good, cheap moisturizer is plain petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline). Use moisturizers that are more greasy than creamy because creams usually have more preservatives in them.

Regular use of a moisturizer can help prevent the dry skin that is common in winter."
127,Edema,https://familydoctor.org/condition/edema/,"Edema is swelling or puffiness of parts of the body. Edema usually happens in the feet, ankles, and legs. It also can affect the face and hands. Pregnant women and older adults often get edema, but it can happen to anyone.","If you have swelling in your legs, ankles, and feet not related to an injury, it could be edema. It can cause puffiness of your face and hands, too. You can have swelling in all of these areas at once or in only one area. It can cause you to feel uncomfortable. It can even restrict the range of motion in your ankles and wrists.","Edema is caused by extra fluid that builds up in the tissues of your body. Many things can cause fluid to build up, including:

• Gravity pulling fluid down into your legs and feet.
• Sitting or standing still for too long, especially in hot weather.
• Eating food with too much salt.
• Taking certain medicines, such as ibuprofen and naproxen.
• Some health problems, such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, and kidney disease.

You cannot catch edema from other people. It does not run in families. However, as you age, the veins in your legs often don’t work as well against gravity and to push the fluid back up. That is why this condition is more common as you get older.","Your doctor can tell whether you have edema by examining you. The skin over the swollen area may be stretched and shiny. Pushing gently on the swollen area for about 15 seconds will leave a dimple. If this happens, your doctor might want to do some additional tests.","Depending on what is causing your edema, you may not be able to prevent it from happening. If it is caused by health problems, such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease, you will not be able to prevent it, only manage it. If your condition is caused by eating too much salt, you will be able to prevent it by eating less salt.

Also, regular exercise such as walking can help lessen edema because it works the calf muscles. These muscles help push fluid upward.","The only way to treat edema is to treat the condition that is causing it. Your doctor might want you to take a medicine called a diuretic. This is also called a water pill. These pills help flush salt and extra fluid out of your body through your urine.

It is important to see your doctor if you have edema, especially if you are pregnant. If it is not treated, your skin may keep stretching. This can lead to other health problems. If you have edema and you start to have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away.","The following are some things you can do at home to keep the swelling down:

• Elevate your legs when you are sitting or lying down.
• If you have edema of the legs, wear support stockings. You can buy these at most drugstores. Support stockings put pressure on your legs to keep fluid from collecting in your legs and ankles.
• Do not sit or stand for long periods of time without moving around.
• Follow your doctor’s advice about limiting how much salt you eat.","• What is causing my edema?
• What treatment is best for me?
• Is it safe for me to exercise?
• Should I wear support stockings?

128,Endometrial Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/endometrial-cancer/,Endometrial cancer is cancer of the endometrium (the lining of the uterus). It is the most common form of uterine cancer.,"The most common symptom of endometrial cancer is abnormal bleeding in your uterus. Contact your doctor if you have:

• Menstrual bleeding that is heavier or lasts longer than usual. This is especially true after the age of 40.
• Menstrual cycles that are shorter than 21 days.
• Post-menopausal bleeding and/or vaginal discharge.",Endometrial cancer does not have an exact cause. Estrogen levels have been known to play a part.,"Your doctor will do a pelvic exam. They also will review your symptoms and health history. To diagnose endometrial cancer, they most often will perform a pelvic ultrasound. Other diagnostic tests may include:

• Endometrial biopsy can be done in your doctor’s office. Your doctor will insert a narrow tube through your vagina and into your uterus. He or she will remove a small tissue sample from your uterine wall. The tissue is tested in a lab for cancerous or precancerous cells.
• Dilation and curettage (D and C) takes about an hour. This is an outpatient procedure. It requires some form of anesthesia. The procedure involves dilating (widening) your cervix (the opening of the uterus). This procedure also requires the doctor to insert a thin tool and collect a tissue sample. A lab will test for cancerous or precancerous cells.
• Imaging tests can help diagnose cancer. These are rarely done to diagnose endometrial cancer, though. Examples include an ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scan. These tests are less invasive and safe for people who cannot have anesthesia.

Talk to your doctor about which procedure is right for you. Tell them if you have health problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or other types of cancer.

If you are diagnosed with endometrial cancer, your doctor will do more testing to determine the stage and grade.","You cannot prevent or avoid endometrial cancer. It is most common in women who are older than 50 years of age and have gone through menopause. A high estrogen level can increase your risk. Obesity, diabetes, or high blood pressure can affect this. Women who use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be careful. If you take estrogen, make sure you supplement it with progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) as well.

• An early first period (before 12 years of age)
• Irregular periods
• Never being pregnant
• Endometrial polyps
• Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
• Use of a medicine called tamoxifen

Using birth control pills with both estrogen and progestin during childbearing years may lower your risk of endometrial cancer.","Treatment for endometrial cancer typically involves a hysterectomy. This is surgery to remove your uterus. You may need your fallopian tubes and ovaries removed as well. If your estrogen level is high, your doctor may prescribe progestin to balance it. You may need radiation therapy or chemotherapy. This will depend on the stage and grade of the cancer.","People who have endometrial cancer can live a long life. Treatment is very effective, especially if the cancer is found early. If it is found late or left untreated, it can spread outside the uterus.","• If I have endometrial cancer, is there a risk that my daughter could have it too?

There are four types of endometrial hyperplasia. These vary by the amount of abnormal cells and the presence of cell changes. The types are:

• Simple
• Complex
• Simple atypical
• Complex atypical","The primary symptom of endometrial hyperplasia is abnormal menstrual bleeding. Contact your doctor if you experience:

• Menstrual bleeding that is heavier or longer-lasting than usual
• Menstrual cycles (amount of time between periods) that are shorter than 21 days
• Menstrual bleeding between periods
• Not having a period (pre-menopause)
• Post-menopause bleeding","Endometrial hyperplasia is caused by too much estrogen and/or not enough progesterone. Both hormones play a role in the menstrual cycle. Estrogen makes the cells grow, while progesterone signals the shedding of the cells. A hormonal imbalance can produce too many cells or abnormal cells.",Abnormal uterine bleeding can be a symptom for many things. Contact your doctor if you experience this. They can perform a physical exam and tests to diagnose the main condition. A transvaginal ultrasound measures your endometrium. It uses sound waves to see if the layer is average or too thick. A thick layer may indicate endometrial hyperplasia. Your doctor will take a biopsy of your endometrium cells to determine if cancer is present.,"You cannot completely prevent endometrial hyperplasia. It is more common in people who have gone through menopause. This is because your body’s hormones and menstrual cycles change. Other risk factors for this condition include:

• Long-term use of medicines that contain high levels of estrogen or chemicals that act like estrogen
• Irregular menstrual cycles, which can be caused by infertility or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
• Obesity
• Tobacco use
• First menstrual cycle at an early age
• Menopause at an older age
• Never having been pregnant
• Family history of uterine, ovarian, or colon cancer

To help lower your risk, you can:

• Lose weight, if you have obesity
• Take progestin (synthetic progesterone), if you already are taking estrogen, due to menopause or another condition
• Take birth control or another medicine to regulate your hormones or menstrual cycle","Treatment options for endometrial hyperplasia depend on what type you have. The most common treatment is progestin. This can be taken in several forms, including pill, shot, vaginal cream, or intrauterine device (IUD).

Atypical types of endometrial hyperplasia, especially complex, increase your risk of cancer. If you have these types, you might consider a hysterectomy. This is a surgery to remove your uterus. Your doctor will only recommend this if you no longer want to become pregnant. There are more conservative treatments for younger women who do not wish to have a hysterectomy.

Talk to your doctor who will help you decide which treatment option is best for you.","In most cases, endometrial hyperplasia is very treatable. Work with your doctor to create a treatment plan. If you have a severe type or if the condition is ongoing, you might need to see your doctor more often to monitor any changes.","• How do I know if my bleeding is caused by endometrial hyperplasia?

130,Endometriosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/endometriosis/,Endometriosis is a medical condition in which the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus in the belly.,"Endometriosis can cause a variety of symptoms including:

• Heavy menstrual bleeding
• Severe cramping or pain before and/or during your period
• Frequent spotting or bleeding between periods
• Pain while going to the bathroom during your period
• Pain with sex
• Pain in your stomach, low back, or rectum
• Problems with fertility
• Unexplained exhaustion or lack of energy
• Digestive or gastrointestinal issues or symptoms","Doctors and researchers do not know the cause of endometriosis. Those with a family history are at higher risk. Retrograde (backwards) menstrual flow is another possible cause. This is when some of the tissue that is shed during your period flows up instead of out. It ends up in your fallopian tubes and other parts of your pelvis.

Other factors include your body’s response to estrogen and progesterone. If your body resists progesterone, it can have a hard time shedding the uterine lining. Some people have flawed immune systems. This means their bodies don’t destroy all of the lining. The leftover lining then attaches to other tissues outside of your uterus.","Endometriosis can be difficult to diagnose. Your doctor will do a physical and pelvic exam. They also will review your symptoms, health history, and family history.

Laparoscopic surgery confirms the diagnosis. This common procedure allows the doctor to look inside your belly for the uterine tissue. Your doctor will make a small cut in your abdomen. They will use a small, lighted camera to look for patches of endometriosis. Your doctor may send a sample of tissue to the lab.","You cannot prevent or avoid endometriosis. Some women have an increased risk for the condition. Factors that increase your risk include:

• Family history
• Starting menstruation early (before the age of 11)
• Short menstrual cycles (27 days or less)
• Long, heavy periods (7 days or more)
• Starting menstruation late
• Low body fat
• Regular exercise (4 or more hours each week)
• Pregnancy","Several types of medicine can treat endometriosis:

• Over-the-counter medicine can relieve pain and inflammation.
• Birth control pills can regulate your hormones and reduce heavy bleeding.
• The hormone progestin can manage symptoms over time. It comes in the form of a shot or a pill.
• Danazol and GnRH analog are hormone shots that stop your periods. This gives your uterus a break from a buildup of tissue. Unfortunately, these shots have side effects similar to menopause, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and unwanted facial hair. Taking a daily estrogen pill can reduce these side effects.
• Aromatase inhibitors, such as exemestane and letrozole, are a newer type of hormonal treatment.

Birth control pills, danazol, and GnRH analogs are taken for 6 to 9 months. During that time, your pain should get better. However, it may come back if you stop taking the medicine.

Your doctor may recommend surgery or a diagnostic laparoscopy. In this procedure, the doctor removes the endometrial tissue that has grown outside of your uterus. As a last resort, your doctor may recommend a hysterectomy. This is the surgical removal of your uterus, and sometimes ovaries.","Endometriosis can make it harder to get pregnant. You may need surgery and/or fertility treatments to help. Talk to your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. Your doctor may advise you to not put it off. The condition can get worse with age, so your chances of getting pregnant lessen over time. Usually, symptoms go away while you’re pregnant. Do not take prescription medicine when you’re trying to get pregnant.

Some studies have suggested that endometriosis may put you at a higher risk of getting ovarian cancer. However, the overall risk is low. Endometriosis often goes away or becomes milder with menopause. Until menopause, medicine and/or surgery may be able to help with symptoms.","• What are the benefits and risks of surgery?

Adenoids help fight infections in your body. They are the most helpful between birth and age 5. They catch the germs that make you sick. That’s what causes them to increase in size. They return to normal size when you are healthy.

After age 5, adenoids shrink in size. They no longer play a big role in your body’s health. It is not normal for them to remain swollen (enlarged). However, if they do, you need to see your doctor. This rarely happens as an adult.","If you have enlarged adenoids, you may have these symptoms:

• Sore throat
• Runny or stuffy nose
• Feeling like your ears are blocked
• Difficulty sleeping
• Difficulty swallowing
• Swollen neck glands
• Snoring
• Sleep apnea (a condition that causes you to stop breathing for short periods while sleeping)
• Chapped lips/bad breath (due to breathing through your mouth)",Infections cause them to temporarily increase in size.,"Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will look at the back of your throat. This may be done by inserting a thin, flexible scope with a mirror through your nose and down the back of your throat. This procedure may be uncomfortable but should not be painful.

Tell your doctor if you have a stuffy nose, sore throat, or your ears hurt. They may order a blood test to see if you have an infection. Your doctor may also order a sleep study to see if you have sleep apnea. This helps determine whether enlarged adenoids are the reason for your sleep problems.",Having enlarged adenoids is a common condition for children. It is less of an issue as people age. There is nothing you can do to prevent it. Prompt attention for a sore throat or ear infection can help your doctor monitor their size. This may reduce your discomfort.,"Treatment depends on your age and how long your adenoids have been enlarged. Your doctor may monitor their size over time or prescribe medicines or a nasal spray to reduce swelling. Surgery to remove your adenoids and tonsils at the same time is common. This is common if you have frequent ear and throat infections, trouble breathing, or sleep apnea.","Children with enlarged adenoids are treated with an antibiotic. This is to eliminate the infection that is causing them to enlarge. Be sure your child takes the full dose. A partial dose will allow the infection to return. If medicine is not effective after repeated illness, your doctor may discuss surgery.","• Can I have my child’s adenoids removed as an elective surgery?

It is newly accepted and may be confused for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). EoE occurs when certain white blood cells (eosinophils) build up in your esophageal lining. Eosinophils help fight disease and control allergic reactions. Your esophagus is the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. It is part of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.","People who have EoE may have symptoms such as:

• Chronic throat pain.
• Trouble swallowing.
• Chest or stomach pain.
• Vomiting.

• Reflux-like symptoms, such as burping, bad taste, or a burning feeling.

EoE is more common in male adults, but children can have it too. Symptoms for kids may include refusing food or having trouble gaining weight.

Too many white blood cells can cause your esophagus to narrow. This can make food get stuck in your throat.",The exact cause for EoE is unknown. It is linked to food and environmental allergies.,"First, your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. Then, they will order an endoscopy. This is a test in which a thin tube is inserted down your throat. A tiny camera takes pictures of your esophageal lining. The doctor will take a sample of this lining (biopsy) to diagnose EoE. Blood tests may be done to rule out other conditions.

If the doctor diagnoses EoE, they can do an allergy test to see what is causing the reaction.",You cannot prevent or avoid EoE. It may run in families.,"There is no cure for EoE. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent further damage. For children, treatment also helps improve growth.

Medicine is one form of treatment. Steroids can reduce swelling and the number of eosinophils. Acid suppressors, such as proton pump inhibitors, can ease reflux-like symptoms.

You may need to make changes in your diet as well. Your doctor can make suggestions based on the results of your allergy test. You also can remove foods from your diet that commonly cause allergies. These include peanuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, wheat, and soy.

People who have EoE may also have GERD and need additional treatment.","EoE is not life threatening. You can manage it with diet and medicines. EoE can cause lasting damage to your esophagus if left untreated. Because EoE is a newer condition, related health issues are unknown.","• How do I know if allergies are causing EoE?

133,Epilepsy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/epilepsy/,"Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain. People who have epilepsy have electrical activity in the brain that is not normal, causing seizures. There are different types of seizures. In some cases, a seizure may cause jerking, uncontrolled movements, and loss of consciousness. In other cases, seizures cause only a period of confusion, a staring spell, or muscle spasms. Epilepsy is also called a “seizure disorder.”

Epilepsy is not a mental illness, and it is not a sign of low intelligence. It is also not contagious. Seizures do not normally cause brain damage. Between seizures, a person with epilepsy is no different from anyone else.","The primary symptom of epilepsy is seizures. A single seizure is not considered epilepsy. People who have epilepsy have repeated episodes of seizures.

There are many different types of seizures, and they each cause different symptoms. Some common types of seizures include the following:

• Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures: This type of seizure affects the whole brain. During the seizure, the muscles in the body become rigid (stiff), then shake and contract (called convulsions). The person having the seizure usually loses consciousness (faints). They may also clench their jaw, bite their tongue or cheek, or lose control of their bladder.
• Absence (or petit mal) seizures: This type of seizure affects the whole brain and usually lasts only a few seconds. During the seizure, a person may have a staring spell, be unaware of their surroundings, suddenly stop talking or moving, or have small changes in muscle movements.
• Partial (focal) seizures: This type of seizure affects only one part of the brain. The symptoms may vary, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts. For example, a partial seizure may cause changes in emotions, or to the senses. These can include hallucinations, numbness, tingling, or other changes to vision, taste, smell, touch, or hearing. This type of seizure may also cause muscle contractions (for example, causing the person to move the head in an unusual way, or jerk an arm or a leg). Or, the seizure may cause staring spells, sometimes with unusual repetitive movements. These can include moving the mouth or the lips, chewing or swallowing, or hand movements.

Before a seizure begins, some people experience dizziness or emotional changes. They also may experience changes in vision (such as hallucinations), smell (smelling an odor that isn’t there), and touch (such as numbness or tingling). Feeling these things before a seizure is called an aura. Recognizing an aura is useful as a warning that you are about to have a seizure.","Doctors don’t always know what causes epilepsy. Some things that may increase your risk for epilepsy include the following:

• Genetics: People with a parent or sibling who has epilepsy are at an increased risk for developing epilepsy.
• Head trauma: Serious head injuries can cause epilepsy, sometimes years after the injury.
• Infection: Infections such as meningitis, encephalitis, and AIDS can increase the risk of epilepsy.
• Medical conditions: Other medical conditions can increase the risk of epilepsy. These include Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, brain tumors, or problems with the blood vessels in the brain.
• Problems during pregnancy, birth, or early development: In some cases, infections during pregnancy, problems during birth, congenital brain defects (problems with the brain that are present at birth), or injury to an infant’s brain may cause epilepsy.","To diagnose epilepsy, your doctor will review your medical history and perform a neurological exam. Your doctor may also recommend blood tests. They may also order an electroencephalogram (EEG), computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests allow your doctor to monitor your brain activity and examine your brain for problems such as bleeding or tumors.","Doctors don’t always know what causes epilepsy. It seems to run in families. In that case, you may not be able to prevent it. But it also could be caused by a head trauma. If so, you might prevent epilepsy if you could prevent injuring your head.","Epilepsy usually is treated with medicine. If medicine doesn’t help your seizures, your doctor may recommend surgery or other therapies. If your doctor knows what is causing your epilepsy, treating the cause may make the seizures stop.

Surgery is most commonly performed if it’s known that your seizures begin in a well-defined area of your brain that doesn’t interfere with important functions like speech, language, or hearing. In other cases of medicine-resistant seizures, your doctor may recommend a type of therapy called vagus nerve stimulation. This requires a small device be implanted under the skin on your chest. The device delivers electrical pulses to the vagus nerve in the neck. A kind of treatment for children with certain types of epilepsy that are difficult to control involves a strict diet that is high in fat and low in carbohydrates. This diet is known as a ketogenic diet. This diet should be prescribed and monitored by a physician. With all treatments, work with your doctor to determine the best treatment for you.","Never knowing when or where a seizure may occur can make you anxious. This anxiety can lead to depression. It could even trigger more seizures. To help combat this, talk to your doctor. They may prescribe medicine to help reduce anxiety or recommend therapy or a support group. You may need help finding a way to cope with your fear of having a seizure.

Epilepsy can also increase your risk of injury or other problems. Talk to your doctor about how to handle any relevant concerns, including:

• Pregnancy complications: Uncontrolled seizures can affect the unborn baby. Epilepsy medicine may also affect the unborn baby. Decisions about taking medicine during pregnancy must be made by you and your doctor, after talking about the risks and the benefits.
• Injury: You can injure yourself during a seizure, or when a seizure causes you to fall, drown while swimming or bathing, or have a car accident. Laws about driving for people with epilepsy are different in each state. Ask your doctor and your local epilepsy foundation about driving rules and restrictions.
• Emotional issues: People who have epilepsy are more likely to experience depression, mood disorders, and suicidal thoughts. Talk to your doctor if you think you might be depressed, or if you have thoughts about harming yourself.
• Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP): People who have epilepsy have a small risk of unexpected death, especially people who have frequent seizures that don’t respond to medicine. Doctors don’t know exactly why SUDEP occurs. It is thought to be the result of breathing or heart problems.","• What causes epilepsy?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","• You have a seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes
• You injured yourself during the seizure
• The way you usually feel during and after having a seizure changes
• It takes you longer than normal to recover after having a seizure
• Your seizures become more severe or happen more frequently
• A second seizure immediately occurs after the first
• You are pregnant
• You have diabetes
• You have a sudden headache, numbness, or weakness in one side of your body, or problems with your vision or speech right before you have a seizure (these could be signs of a stroke)

Medicines that help prevent seizures are called anticonvulsants or antiepileptics. Your doctor will recommend a medicine based on the type of seizures you have, how often you have seizures, your age, and your general health. After you begin taking the medicine, your doctor will monitor you closely to determine whether the drug is working. They will also be watching for side effects, and to make sure your dose is correct.

Side effects may include fatigue, dizziness, skin rash, or problems with your memory, coordination, or speech. Call your doctor right away if you experience depression, suicidal thoughts, or severe rash while taking your medicine.

To help your medicine work well, follow your doctor’s instructions for taking it. Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor. Ask your doctor what to do if you miss a dose. Never take extra medicine, even if you think you’re about to have a seizure. Talk to your doctor before you start taking any new medicines, including vitamins or supplements.

You should avoid drinking alcohol if you have epilepsy. Alcohol can make it easier to have a seizure and can also affect the way your epilepsy medicine works in your body. Some medicines can also make it easier to have a seizure, so check with your doctor before starting to take any new medicines.

It may be possible for some people who have epilepsy to eventually stop taking medicine. However, this decision must be made by your doctor. Before you and your doctor can decide to stop the medicine, several questions should be considered. These include how quickly your seizures were controlled, how long you have been free of seizures, and if you have other illnesses that may affect your problem.

If you have epilepsy, you may want to share the following information with your family, friends, and coworkers. If someone near you has a seizure, use the following general guidelines:

• Stay calm.
• Don’t move the person to another place.
• Don’t try to keep the person from moving or shaking.
• Don’t try to wake the person by shouting at or shaking them.
• Remove items that could cause injury if the person falls or bumps into them.
• Gently turn the person on his or her side so any fluid in the mouth can safely come out.
• Never try to force the person’s mouth open or put anything in it.
• Place something soft (such as a pillow) under their head.
• Most seizures aren’t life-threatening. You don’t need to call a doctor or an ambulance unless the person isn’t known to have epilepsy or unless the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.
• When the seizure is over, watch the person for signs of confusion.
• Allow the person to rest or sleep if they wish."
134,Erectile Dysfunction (ED),https://familydoctor.org/condition/erectile-dysfunction/,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is when a man cannot get or keep an erection. The condition prevents the man from having sex or finishing sex. This condition used to be called impotence. ED can occur at any age, but it is more common in men older than 75 years of age.

ED doesn’t have to be a part of getting older. As a man ages, he may need more stimulation (stroking and touching) to get an erection. He might also need more time between erections. Older men should still be able to get an erection and enjoy sex.",The primary symptom of ED is not being able to get or keep an erection for sex.,"Erectile dysfunction can be caused by:

• Diabetes (high blood sugar)
• Hypertension (high blood pressure)
• Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)
• Stress, anxiety, or depression
• Alcohol and tobacco use
• Some prescription medicines. This includes antidepressants, pain medicine, and high blood pressure medicine
• Fatigue
• Brain or spinal cord injuries
• Hypogonadism (a condition that leads to low levels of the male hormone, testosterone)
• Multiple sclerosis
• Parkinson’s disease
• Radiation therapy to the testicles
• Stroke
• Some types of prostate or bladder surgery

Problems in your relationship with your sexual partner can also cause erectile dysfunction. Improving your relationship may help your sex life. If you decide to seek therapy, it will probably be most effective if your sex partner is included.

Couples can learn new ways to please one another and to show affection. This can reduce anxiety about having erections.

Certain feelings can lead to erectile dysfunction, including:

• Feeling nervous about sex. This could be because of a bad experience or a previous episode of ED.
• Feeling stressed, including work and family stress.
• Feeling depressed.
• Feeling self-conscious about your body or performance.
• Thinking your partner is reacting negatively toward you.","ED is usually easy to diagnose. If you are tempted to self-diagnose, talk to your doctor. They will want to make sure it isn’t related to another health condition.

Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms. They may do a blood or urine test. Your doctor may consider other tests to rule out other conditions.","This depends on whether you know what it is causing your ED. There are some things you can do that may help prevent ED, including:

• Avoid drinking too much alcohol, smoking, or abusing drugs.
• Ask your doctor if ED is a side effect of a new or current medicine you are taking. He or she may have an alternative medicine.
• Control your blood sugar and blood pressure.
• Try to relax and avoid stress.","Treatment depends on what is causing it. If it is caused by uncontrolled blood sugar and high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your doctor’s instructions.

If your doctor rules out other causes, he or she may prescribe Sildenafil (brand name: Viagra), tadalafil (brand name Cialis), and vardenafil (brand name Levitra). These medicines are taken by mouth to help you maintain an erection.

Not everyone can use these medicines. Your doctor may talk to you about alprostadil if oral medicines aren’t an option for you. Alprostadil is a synthetic version of prostaglandin E. It can be injected into the penis or inserted as a tiny suppository into the urethra (the hole at the end of the penis). Your doctor will help you decide which treatment is best for you.

Follow your doctor’s instructions when taking ED medicine. Usually, a man takes 1 tablet 30 minutes to 1 hour before he plans to have sex. Sildenafil works for 4-8 hours; vardenafil works for up to 8 hours; and tadalafil works for up to 36 hours.

You should not take more than 1 dose in 24 hours. Tadalafil and vardenafil come in tablets of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg. Sildenafil comes in tablets of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg.

Even if you take the medicine, you still need physical and mental stimulation and desire to have an erection. If your first dose doesn’t help, call your doctor. Your doctor may want to change your tablet strength.

The side effects of ED medicine are mostly the same. Sildenafil and vardenafil can cause:

• Headache
• Flushing (face and upper body turning red and warm)
• Upset stomach
• Runny nose
• Vision changes (things look blue)

Tadalafil has the same side effects, except for the flushing and possible changes in vision. It can also cause back pain and muscle aches. For each of the medicines, headache is the most common side effect. Vision changes are the least common. Talk to your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you.

Call your doctor right away if you take one of these medications and have a prolonged erection that lasts 4 hours or longer. This condition may cause permanent impotence if not treated.

You shouldn’t use these medicines if you take nitroglycerin or any other nitrates for chest pain. If you have heart problems, tell your doctor before taking any ED medicines. These medicines can have serious side effects in people who have heart problems.

If you use sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil and get chest pains, be sure to tell the paramedics, nurses or doctors at the hospital that you use it and when you used it last.","If the medicines aren’t right for you, you could try using a penile implant, vacuum pump devices, or have surgery. Your doctor may send you to a urologist to talk about these options.","• How long will I have to take medicine for erectile dysfunction?
• What is the difference between tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and sildenafil (Viagra)?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I should make?
• How can I talk with my partner about my problem?
• Is there something I can do other than take medicine to help?
• What other medicines cause this problem?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Erectile Dysfunction

135,Esophageal Atresia and Tracheoesophageal Fistula,https://familydoctor.org/condition/esophageal-atresia-and-tracheoesophageal-fistula/,"An esophageal atresia (EA) and a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) are 2 disorders of the digestive system. The condition affects babies. It starts while the mother is pregnant. This makes it a congenital defect. The 2 disorders often happen together.

An EA is when the esophagus doesn’t connect to the stomach. TEF is when the esophagus and windpipe (trachea) have an incorrect connection. The poor connection is called a fistula. There are several types of EA. An EA sends the baby’s nutrients to a pouch. So, nothing the baby swallows enters the stomach. With a TEF, food or milk can get into your baby’s lungs when they swallow. This can cause breathing problems and even pneumonia.

About 1 of 4,000 babies has one or both of these problems. Sometimes a baby is born with one and not the other.

Babies with this condition can breathe saliva and other fluids into their lungs. This can cause pneumonia, choking, and even death. Being born prematurely may make the condition worse.","The main problems EA causes are with the digestive system. TEF usually causes breathing problems. Symptoms of EA/TEF include:

• Feeding problems upon birth
• Frequent drooling or spitting up
• Bubbly mucus in the mouth
• Coughing, gagging, or choking when feeding
• Bluish skin color when feeding
• Difficulty breathing

Most babies with EA develop symptoms right after birth. For babies who have TEF but not EA, symptoms are mild and could take weeks to diagnose.","Doctors are not sure exactly what causes these problems. While pregnant, your child’s esophagus and trachea start to grow from the same bit of tissue. Sometimes the tubes don’t develop correctly. Doctors don’t think it’s inherited. In some cases, an EA/TEF have a heart defect.","An ultrasound during pregnancy is the first clue. If there is too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby), the baby may have a blockage in his or her digestive system. The blockage could be an EA.

If your doctor suspects EA after the baby is born, they can insert a feeding tube through your baby’s mouth or nose. The tube normally goes down to the stomach. If it can’t reach the stomach, your doctor will probably diagnose your baby with EA. An X-ray can detect air in the esophagus, stomach, and intestine. It can help confirm the diagnosis. An X-ray can also help confirm TEF.","There is nothing a woman who is pregnant can do to prevent her baby from developing EA/TEF before birth. The best thing she can do is to take good care of herself while pregnant. This includes:

• Eating a healthy diet
• Exercising
• Getting plenty of rest
• Attending all scheduled doctor appointments","EA/TEF is an emergency situation. Your baby will need surgery to fix the problem. If your baby has EA, the swallowing tube must be connected to the stomach. If a fistula is connecting the esophagus and windpipe, it must be closed. Your child’s doctor will decide when to do the surgery. Healthy, full-term babies can have the surgery at just a few days old. If the baby has any other problems (such as pneumonia or other birth defects), surgery may have to wait.

In uncomplicated cases, your baby may start eating as soon as one week after surgery. Until your baby can swallow milk or formula, they will be fed through an IV or a stomach tube. Your baby will stay in the hospital during this time. Recovery time could be longer if your baby was born premature or the operation was complicated.","Infants with EA/TEF often have another problem called tracheomalacia. This is a weakness and floppiness to the walls of the windpipe. It can cause their breathing to be noisy or sound high-pitched.

Some babies who have esophageal atresia also have other problems. These include:

• Heart problems
• Kidney problems
• Stomach and bowel problems
• Muscle and bone problems

Your doctor will do a physical exam of your baby. They may order more X-rays or ultrasound tests. These usually show if your baby has other problems. Babies with other problems might have to get those fixed first. Then they can have the surgery to fix the swallowing tube.

Babies born with esophageal atresia sometimes have long-term problems, including:

• Gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. This is similar to heartburn. It can usually be treated with medicine.
• Scar tissue. Sometimes scar tissue grows where the esophagus connects to the stomach. This can make swallowing hard or painful. Food can’t easily get past it. Surgery may be necessary to open the scar tissue. This might require more tests or a procedure to see inside the esophagus and stomach.","• What tests and procedures are needed to make this diagnosis?
• Are there other options besides surgery?
• How long will my baby be in the hospital, and how long will it take them to recover?
• What health condition is my baby at risk of, and how can I help prevent them?
• Will my baby be in pain after surgery?

136,Essential Tremor,https://familydoctor.org/condition/essential-tremor/,"Essential tremor is a disorder in your nervous system. It causes shaking movements that you can’t control, most often in your hands. You might notice this tremor when your arms are reaching out in front of your body. It is caused by problems in communication between certain areas of the brain. A tremor affects people in different ways. Some people hardly notice it. Other people may be embarrassed by it. A tremor can sometimes interfere with activities such as eating, drinking, or writing.

Essential tremor is just one kind of tremor. Other things that can cause a tremor include:

• Parkinson’s disease
• Multiple sclerosis
• Fatigue after exercise
• Extreme emotional stress
• Brain tumors
• Some prescription medicines
• Alcohol or drug withdrawal

There is no cure for essential tremor, but it can be treated.","Many diseases or conditions cause tremors. Symptoms that could indicate your tremor is essential tremor include:

• Shaking in your hands.
• Head nodding or shaking.
• Quivering voice.
• Tremors worsen with emotional stress.
• Tremors worsen with purposeful movement.
• Rest helps to relieve tremors.

Often, tremors are the only symptom you have when you have essential tremor. Other conditions that cause tremors come with other symptoms.","It is not clear why some people get essential tremor. It seems to run in families. You may be more likely to have essential tremor if a parent or other close family member has tremor. Tremor can start at any age, but it often begins after age 40. It can get worse as you get older.","Your doctor will probably perform an exam and tests to look for possible causes of your tremor. These tests rule out other causes and can include a neurological exam, blood and urine tests, and physical performance tests. If they don’t find another cause of your tremor, you may be diagnosed with essential tremor. There is no specific test for essential tremor.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes essential tremor, so it can’t be prevented. If your doctor determines your tremor is caused by medicine or caffeine, you may be able to avoid essential tremor in the future by avoiding those substances.","The goal in treating essential tremor is to provide symptom relief that can improve quality of life. Mild tremors may not need treatment. If your essential tremor interferes with your ability to function or bothers you, there are some treatments that could help. These include medicine, focused ultrasound, or deep brain stimulation.

• Medicine– Your doctor might suggest oral medicines to help decrease the severity of your tremor. These could include beta blockers, anti-seizure medicines, tranquilizers, or Botox injections.
• Therapy– Physical therapy can help you improve your muscle strength, control, and coordination. Occupational therapy can help you make modifications to reduce the effects of tremors, such as using heavier glasses to drink out of.
• Surgery– If your tremor is very disabling and you haven’t had good results with medicine, you could qualify for surgery. Usually this is deep brain stimulation (DBS). Electrodes are implanted into the area of your brain that coordinates muscle control.","Lifestyle changes are often recommended to prevent the tremor from getting worse. Your doctor will ask you to avoid caffeine, cold medicines, and certain other medicines if they seem to make your tremor worse. These medicines won’t make your tremor go away. However, the medicine may control the tremor enough to allow you to do normal activities without frustration or embarrassment.

Symptoms do tend to get worse over time. Eventually you might start having trouble with daily functions, including:

• Holding a glass of liquid without spilling
• Eating normally
• Putting on makeup or shaving
• Talking, if it affects your tongue or voice box","• Is essential tremor the sign of another condition?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Yes, many things can cause tremor. Not all tremors are essential tremors. For example, Parkinson’s disease causes tremor that you might notice when your hands are resting in your lap or at the sides of your body. A stroke can cause tremor that gets worse when you reach for something. Thyroid problems or low blood sugar can cause mild tremor. Tremor can be caused by some medicines. These include heart medicines, decongestants, medicines for breathing problems, and tricyclic antidepressants. Drinks that contain caffeine also may cause a tremor."
137,Eustachian Tube Dysfunction,https://familydoctor.org/condition/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/,"The Eustachian tube is a small passageway that connects your throat to your middle ear. When you sneeze, swallow, or yawn, your Eustachian tubes open. This keeps air pressure and fluid from building up inside your ear. But sometimes a Eustachian tube clogs up. This is called Eustachian tube dysfunction. When this happens, sounds may be muffled, and your ear may feel full or painful.","If you have Eustachian tube dysfunction:

• Your ears may feel plugged or full.
• Sounds may seem muffled.
• You may feel a popping or clicking sensation (children may say their ear “tickles”).
• You may have pain in one or both ears.
• You may hear ringing in your ears (called tinnitus).
• You may sometimes have trouble keeping your balance.

Your symptoms may get worse with changes in altitude. This includes flying in an airplane, riding in elevators, driving through mountains, or diving.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises against the use of ear candles (inserting a special candle in the ear). It is supposed to pull wax and debris out of your ear as it burns. Ear candles can cause serious injuries and there is no evidence to support their effectiveness.","The most common cause of Eustachian tube dysfunction is when the tube become swollen (inflamed) and mucus or fluid builds up. This can be caused by a cold, the flu, a sinus infection, or allergies. Some people are at greater risk for Eustachian tube dysfunction. They include:

• Children. Their tubes are shorter and straighter than those of an adult. This makes it easier for germs to reach the middle ear and for fluid to become trapped there. Also, children’s immune systems are not fully developed, making it harder for them to fight off infections.
• People who smoke. Smoking damages the cilia (the tiny hairs that sweep mucus from the middle ear to the back of the nose). This can allow mucus to gather in the tubes.
• People with obesity. Fatty deposits around the tubes can lead to Eustachian tube dysfunction.","Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and examine you. They will examine your ear canals and eardrums, your nasal passages, and the back of your throat.","Reduce your risk of developing this condition by treating the underlying cause of the blockage — usually allergies, a cold, or the flu.","Symptoms of Eustachian tube dysfunction usually go away without treatment. You can do exercises to open up the tubes. This includes swallowing, yawning, or chewing gum. You can help relieve the “full ear” feeling by taking a deep breath, pinching your nostrils closed, and “blowing” with your mouth shut.

If you think your baby may have Eustachian tube dysfunction, feed him or her. You can also give them a pacifier. These actions encourage the swallow reflex.

If these strategies don’t help, your doctor may suggest other options. These can include:

• Using a decongestant to reduce the swelling of the lining of the tubes
• Taking an antihistamine or using a steroid nasal spray to reduce any allergic response
• Making a tiny incision in the eardrum and suctioning out the fluid in the middle ear. This gives the Eustachian tube lining time to shrink while the eardrum is healing (usually 1 to 3 days).
• Implanting small tubes in the eardrums. Tubes let built-up fluid drain out of the middle ear. Children who get a lot of ear infections sometimes get tubes in their ears. They stay in up to 18 months and fall out on their own.
• Using a balloon dilation system. A doctor will insert a small balloon through your nose and into the Eustachian tube using a catheter (long, flexible tube). When it is inflated, the balloon opens a pathway for mucus and air to flow through the tube. This can help it function properly.","Managing your symptoms when you have allergies can help keep your Eustachian tubes clear and prevent an infection. Home care exercises such as swallowing or yawning usually take care of any problems. If you or your child show symptoms of severe pain in the ear, call your family doctor.","• My ears feel full and don’t feel better when I yawn. Could I have Eustachian tube dysfunction?
• What can I do to make my child more comfortable?
• My child has Eustachian tube dysfunction. Will they have ear infections?
• Is there anything I can do when I travel to make myself more comfortable?
• Could my allergies make Eustachian tube dysfunction worse?

138,Exercise-induced Bronchospasm,https://familydoctor.org/condition/exercise-induced-bronchospasm/,"Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) happens when the airways in your lungs narrow when you exercise. This makes it hard to breathe. If you have EIB, it may be hard to exercise for more than 30 minutes at a time.

EIB also is called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. It is the same thing as exercise-induced asthma.","Symptoms of EIB start after about 5 to 20 minutes of non-stop exercise. The length of time depends on how severe your condition is. Symptoms can include:

• Shortness of breath or wheezing
• Decreased endurance
• Tightness in the chest
• Coughing
• Upset stomach
• Sore throat","EIB is caused by activity that triggers an asthma reaction. For some people, certain types of exercise trigger symptoms. For others, breathing in air that is cooler and drier than the air in your lungs causes EIB. If you have EIB and chronic asthma, your symptoms may be worse in the spring and fall. This is when people have more trouble with allergies.

It can also be triggered by airborne irritants related to some sports, including chlorine when swimming and pollution while running.","Contact your doctor if you have symptoms of EIB. The doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They likely will perform breathing tests as well. During the tests, the doctor has you breathe into a spirometer or peak flow meter. These devices measure how much air you can blow out of your lungs. If your doctor thinks you have EIB, they will discuss your treatment options.","You cannot avoid EIB. However, you can help prevent flare-ups. Avoid types of exercise or conditions that trigger symptoms. Work with your doctor to identify these.","You and your doctor will decide which medicine is right for you. They will give you instructions on when and how to take your medicine. It is important to follow these orders to make sure the medicine is effective.

Types of medicines used to treat EIB include:

• A short-acting bronchodilator. This is taken 15 minutes before exercise and lasts 4 to 6 hours.
• A mast cell stabilizer. This is taken 15 minutes to 1 hour before exercise and lasts for 4 hours.
• A long-acting bronchodilator. This is taken 30 minutes before exercise and lasts up to 12 hours.
• An antileukotriene. This lasts up to 24 hours. It is taken every day and helps keep your airways from shrinking.","Most people who have EIB still can exercise. However, you may have to avoid certain types of exercise. Medicine can prevent and manage most symptoms. There also are lifestyle changes you can make:

• Warm up and cool down for at least 15 minutes before and after you exercise. This can help lessen EIB symptoms.
• Avoid exercising in very cold temperatures.
• Avoid exercising when you are sick, like with a cold or the flu.
• Avoid exercising when your allergies are bad. For instance, when pollen levels are high.
• If you smoke, stop smoking.","• I have trouble breathing when I exercise? Do I have EIB?
• How does EIB differ from regular asthma?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? What kinds of exercise can I do?
• Are there medicines I can take to prevent and treat my symptoms?
• How long do I have to take the medicines and what are the side effects?
• Are there other lifestyle changes I can make to relieve my symptoms?
• Will I always have EIB or can it go away?","American Academy of Family Physicians: Recognition and Management of Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm

139,Exercise-induced Urticaria,https://familydoctor.org/condition/exercise-induced-urticaria/,null,"Symptoms may occur during or after exercise. Common ones include:

• Hives
• Itching of the skin
• Flushing (redness) of the skin
• Trouble breathing or a choking feeling
• Stomach cramps
• Headache
• Swelling of the face, tongue, or hands","Exercise-induced urticaria is an allergic skin reaction brought on by exercise. It generally produces hives and other allergic symptoms. The hives, or welts, are large, raised bumps on the skin. They can occur on any part of the body. They often are redder around the edge than in the middle. Hives also can look like red spots, blotches, or blisters.

Physical activity can cause some people to have allergic reactions. The exact cause of this condition is unknown.","If you notice hives and other symptoms, stop exercising right away. Contact your doctor if the hives do not go away 5 to 10 minutes after exercise. The doctor will look at your symptoms and review your health history. They may order a skin-prick test to check for allergies. Or they may do exercise tests to see if the reaction occurs again.","You cannot avoid exercise-induced urticaria. However, you can help prevent flare-ups. Avoid food, products, or types of exercise that trigger hives and other symptoms. Work with your doctor to identify these.","Medicines, such as antihistamines, can prevent and treat some symptoms. In severe cases, symptoms may be life threatening, but this is rare. If you’ve ever had severe symptoms, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called epinephrine. This is more commonly known as an EpiPen. You inject this medicine as soon as symptoms start. It stops the symptoms before they become life threatening.","People who have severe cases may need to avoid exercise all together. Other people may be able to exercise if they avoid triggers. These can include certain types of exercise or foods. Keep track of what you eat before you exercise. If you notice a pattern to your symptoms, stop eating that food. If hives and symptoms also stop, tell your doctor. They probably will tell you to avoid the food. The doctor may tell you not to exercise for 4 to 6 hours after you eat.

Most symptoms can be controlled with medicine(s) prescribed by your doctor. Take these according to your doctor’s orders. Pay close attention to your body and reactions. Slow down or stop exercising as soon as symptoms start. Exercise with a partner who knows about your condition. If you have a history of severe symptoms, carry your EpiPen with you in case of emergency.","• What is the cause of my hives?

140,Fainting,https://familydoctor.org/condition/fainting/,"Fainting happens when your brain does not get enough oxygen. You lose consciousness, or “pass out,” for a brief time (usually just a few seconds or minutes).","The primary symptom of fainting is losing consciousness. But there are other symptoms that may occur before you faint. These include feeling:

• Lightheaded
• Dizzy
• Nauseated
• Sweaty

You also may have a headache or ringing in your ears.","Fainting, which is also called syncope, can be caused by many different things. Sometimes a specific cause for fainting cannot be found.

A sudden drop in your blood pressure can cause you to faint. Sometimes your heart rate and blood vessels can’t react fast enough when your body’s need for oxygen changes. This is very common among older people. It is also common in people who have certain health conditions, such as diabetes. Fainting can happen when:

• You stand up too fast
• You work or play hard (especially if it’s very hot)
• You begin to breathe too fast (called hyperventilating)
• You get very upset (being upset can affect the nerves that control your blood pressure)
• You’re taking medicine for high blood pressure

Coughing, urinating, and stretching can also get in the way of the flow of oxygen to the brain and may cause you to faint. If you faint once during one of these activities, it’s probably not something to worry about. But if it happens more than once, tell your doctor about it.

If you faint when you turn your head to the side, the bones in your neck may be pinching one of the blood vessels that lead to your brain. If this happens to you, be sure to tell your doctor about it.

A drop in your blood sugar may also cause you to faint. This can happen if you have diabetes. It may also happen if you don’t eat for a long time.

Some prescription medicines can cause fainting. Be sure to talk to your doctor if you think your fainting may be related to a medicine you’re taking.

Alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana can also cause fainting.

More serious causes of fainting include seizures and problems with the heart or with the blood vessels leading to the brain.",Your doctor will probably ask you about what was happening or what you were doing when you fainted. They may ask you for details about how you felt right before and right after you fainted. Your doctor will probably also want to examine you and may perform some tests to find out why you fainted.,"People who have certain medical conditions are more likely to faint. These conditions include:

• Heart problems (irregular heartbeat or blockages in or near the heart that prevent the blood from getting to the brain)
• Diabetes
• Anxiety or panic disorders
• Dehydration
• Low blood sugar","You probably don’t need to go to your doctor if you have only fainted one time and you are otherwise in good health. Fainting is common and usually not serious. However, if you have serious health problems or are on multiple medications, you probably should see your doctor. This is especially important if you have heart-related problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes. See your doctor if you faint and also have any of these symptoms or conditions:

• Irregular heartbeat
• Chest pain
• Pregnancy
• Shortness of breath
• Sudden onset (no warning signs)
• Blurred vision
• Confusion
• Trouble talking
• Taking longer than a few seconds to regain consciousness
• Fainting when you turn your head to the side
• Fainting more than once in a month","In most cases, fainting can be treated and controlled. Often, diagnosing what is causing fainting is the most difficult part. If your fainting is not under control, you should talk to your doctor about whether it is safe for you to drive.","• What is the most likely cause of my fainting?
• Is there something I can do to stop my fainting spells?
• Is there a medicine I can take that will help prevent fainting?
• Are there any steps I can take at home that will help me stop fainting?
• If I faint once, should I call the doctor immediately after I wake up?
• Is there a diet I should follow to help deal with my fainting?
• Are there any websites you recommend that I access? Do you have any educational materials I could read about fainting?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Fainting

When you stand up, do so slowly."
141,Febrile Seizures,https://familydoctor.org/condition/febrile-seizures/,"Febrile seizures or “fever seizures” look like seizures or convulsions. They occur in young children with a fever above 102°F (38.9°C). Febrile seizures can occur in children ages 6 months to 5 years but are most common in toddlers ages 12 months to 18 months.

Febrile seizures are frightening, but they aren’t as dangerous as they may appear. Febrile seizures aren’t harmful to a child. A febrile seizure doesn’t cause brain damage. Also, your child can’t swallow their tongue during a seizure (it is physically impossible for someone to swallow their tongue).

Febrile seizures usually last a few minutes. It’s very rare for a febrile seizure to last more than 5 minutes. Usually, a child who has had a febrile seizure does not need to be hospitalized. They probably don’t need X-rays or a brain wave test. Your child may only need to be seen by your family doctor so the cause of the fever can be found and treated, if needed.

If your child is younger than 3 months old and has what looks like a febrile seizure, they should been seen immediately by their doctor or in the emergency room.","If your child has a febrile seizure, they may become unconscious and roll their eyes back. Your child’s arms and legs may become stiff or shake and twitch. Your child may also vomit. After a seizure, your child may seem drowsy and confused.","Febrile seizures are triggered by fever caused by an infection. Your child is more likely to spike a high fever from a viral infection than a bacterial infection. Examples of viral infections are the flu, common cold, and roseola.",You should see your doctor as soon as possible after a febrile seizure. Your doctor will examine your child and ask you questions about the seizure. Your doctor also may order tests to determine what is causing your child’s fever.,That is unknown. Many doctors believe the risk of side effects from seizure medicines are worse than another febrile seizure. Even the medicine may not prevent another seizure.,"What should I do if my child has a seizure?

• Put your child on his or her side so that they won’t choke on saliva or vomit.
• Don’t put anything in your child’s mouth.
• Don’t restrain your child’s movements during the seizure. But try to clear the area so that your child can’t bump against anything that would hurt them.
• Try to remain calm. Most seizures stop on their own within a few minutes, so keep your eyes on a clock or watch.
• Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than 10 minutes or is accompanied by a stiff neck, vomiting, or breathing problems.
• Don’t try to lower your child’s fever by placing them in a cold bath, especially during a seizure.

When the seizure has stopped, call your doctor. They may want to see your child to find the cause of the fever.","If your child has had a febrile seizure, you may worry that they will have another. Most children will not. But the risk of another febrile seizure is slightly higher if:

• Your child is younger than 18 months.
• There’s a family history of febrile seizures.
• The fever wasn’t very high when the seizure occurred.","• What caused my child’s febrile seizure?
• Will my child have another febrile seizure?
• Is there anything I can do to prevent a febrile seizure?
• Are there signs that I should look for before my child has a febrile seizure?
• Should I hold my child while they are having febrile seizure?
• Should I put a tongue depressor in my child’s mouth during the seizure?
• Is there anything I can do after a seizure to make my child more comfortable?
• Should I have my child checked for epilepsy if they have a seizure?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Febrile Seizures­—What to Ask Your Doctor

Even repeated febrile seizures aren’t considered epilepsy. Children outgrow the risk of having a seizure caused by fever. A child who has epilepsy usually has 2 or more seizures that aren’t caused by fever.

Febrile seizures don’t cause epilepsy. But the chance of epilepsy developing in a child who has had several febrile seizures is slightly higher than if they did not have a febrile seizure. That chance is about 2% to 4%. There is no evidence that treating your child with medicine for febrile seizures will prevent epilepsy."
142,Fecal Incontinence,https://familydoctor.org/condition/fecal-incontinence/,"Fecal incontinence is the inability to control bowel movements. This leads to stool (feces) leaking from the rectum at unexpected times. It is more common in women and in the elderly of both sexes.

Many people who have fecal incontinence are ashamed to talk about this problem with their doctor. They think that nothing can help them. However, many effective treatments for fecal incontinence are available.","Symptoms of fecal incontinence

Fecal incontinence symptoms can be mild (streaks or stains of leaked stool in your underwear) to more severe (not being able to control bowel movements).","Bowel function is controlled by 3 things: anal sphincter pressure, rectal sensation, and rectal storage capacity. The anal sphincter is a muscle that contracts to prevent stool from leaving the rectum. This muscle is critical in maintaining continence. Rectal sensation tells a person that stool is in the rectum and that it is time to go to the bathroom. The rectum can stretch and hold stool for some time after a person becomes aware that the stool is there. This is the rectal storage capacity.

A person also must be alert enough to notice the rectal sensation and do something about it. They must also be able to move to a toilet. If something is wrong with any of these factors, then fecal incontinence can occur.

Muscle damage is involved in most cases of fecal incontinence. For some people, this damage occurs during childbirth. It’s especially likely to happen in a difficult delivery that uses forceps or an episiotomy. An episiotomy is when a cut is made to enlarge the opening to the vagina before delivery. Muscle damage can also occur during rectal surgery, such as surgery for hemorrhoids. It may also occur in people who have inflammatory bowel disease or a perirectal abscess.

People can often compensate for muscle weakness. Typically, incontinence develops later in life when muscles weaken and the supporting structures in the pelvis become loose.

Damage to the nerves that control the anal muscle or regulate rectal sensation is also a common cause of fecal incontinence. Nerve injury can occur in the following situations:

• During childbirth
• With severe and prolonged straining for stool
• With diseases such as diabetes, spinal cord tumors, and multiple sclerosis

Fecal incontinence may also be caused by a reduction in the elasticity of the rectum. This shortens the time between the sensation of the stool and the urgent need to have a bowel movement. Surgery or radiation injury can scar and stiffen the rectum. Inflammatory bowel disease can also make the rectum less elastic.

Because diarrhea is more difficult to control than formed stool, it is an added stress that can lead to fecal incontinence.

How is fecal incontinence diagnosed?

Along with a physical exam, your doctor may want to do other tests such as an anorectal manometry. This tests anal pressure, rectal elasticity, and rectal sensation. These tests can pinpoint the cause of your incontinence.

Can fecal incontinence be prevented or avoided?

Even though you may be able to reduce your risk of fecal incontinence, you may not always be able to prevent it. This is because anal muscles can be damaged by no fault of yours. These muscles will also naturally weaken over time, despite your best effort to keep them strong.","How is fecal incontinence diagnosed.

Attempts at self-treatment are usually unsuccessful.

The treatment of fecal incontinence varies and depends on the cause of your problem. Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatments:

• Dietary changes. Preventing diarrhea and constipation are usually very helpful in controlling incontinence. Changes in your diet such as adjusting the amount of fiber you eat, drinking more fluids, or changing the amount of food you eat can often prevent diarrhea and constipation.
• Your doctor may prescribe laxatives, anti-diarrhea drugs, or stool softeners to treat incontinence. Talk to your doctor before you take any over-the-counter incontinence medicines.
• Bowel training. Developing a regular bowel movement pattern can be very helpful. This may involve going to bathroom at specific times of the day such as after you eat. can also include a treatment called anorectal biofeedback. This procedure measures your sphincter contractions while you do special exercises called Kegel exercises. Biofeedback training can strengthen your sphincter muscles and give you more control over bowel movements.
• Pelvic floor physical therapy. This treatment can also help as it involves training to help strengthen pelvic floor muscles.
• Several different surgical procedures can treat fecal incontinence. Often these surgeries repair or replace sphincter muscles.","Living with fecal incontinence can be socially and emotionally challenging, no matter what your age. Do not let it isolate you. Do not be embarrassed to talk to your doctor if you have fecal incontinence. It is a very treatable condition. Your doctor can recommend the best treatment for you.

If a treatment plan doesn’t completely solve your fecal incontinence, there are many products that can help you discreetly hide it. These include disposable undergarments as well as a patch that tucks between your cheeks for minor bowel leakage.","• What is the best treatment for me?
• How long will my treatment last?
• Is there anything I can do at home that will help?
• Are there any medicines I can take?
• Will exercises help?
• How long will my recovery be after surgery?
• Will I have to have any physical therapy after surgery?
• Should I eat more fiber?

143,Female Athlete Triad,https://familydoctor.org/condition/female-athlete-triad/,"The female athlete triad is a disorder that women can develop. The disorder affects three body functions that are connected to each other. These are:

• Energy levels
• Menstrual cycles
• Bone mass","Signs and symptoms of the female athlete triad include:

• Fatigue
• Weight loss
• Bone loss
• Absent or abnormal periods
• Stress fractures
• Fasting or limiting food intake
• Binge eating
• Self-induced vomiting
• Extreme exercise","The main cause of the female athlete triad is an energy imbalance. This imbalance causes you to use more energy than you consume. Females who are very active may have this problem. It may be on purpose or by accident. The female athlete triad also may be due to an eating disorder, such as anorexia.

Girls and women may be at risk for the female athlete triad if they:

• Are a competitive athlete
• Play sports that require them to maintain a certain weight or to check their weight often
• Exercise more than what is healthy
• Are obsessed with being thin
• Have body image issues
• Are depressed
• Are pushed by their coach or parents to win at all costs","Contact a doctor if you or someone you know may have the female athlete triad. The doctor will ask questions about your periods, eating habits, and exercise routine. They also will do a physical exam. Your doctor may ask you if you take certain medicines, such as diet pills, laxatives, or birth control pills.

Your doctor may order blood tests to check vitamin D levels. They also may order a bone density study.","There are things you can do to prevent the female athlete triad, especially if you are at risk:

• Eat a nutrient-rich, well-balanced diet.
• Exercise in moderate amounts.
• Get plenty of rest.
• Find ways to reduce stress.
• Talk to a doctor or counselor to get help.","The female athlete triad is a disorder that should be taken seriously. Most cases require treatment. A doctor will talk to you about healthy eating habits and lifestyle choices. You may need to change your diet. A nutritionist can help create an eating plan that provides enough vitamins and nutrients. You also may need to change your exercise routine. Your doctor may recommend taking at least one day off each week from athletic training.

If your periods do not return to normal, you may need more treatment. Your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to help regulate your cycle. Hormone medicines that include estrogen or progesterone may help as well. These can balance your energy and improve bone strength.","Women who have the female athlete triad can develop other health problems. Amenorrhea is a condition that occurs when you miss a period for 3 months or more in a row. Osteoporosis is a disease that makes your bones thin and weak. It can occur when your body doesn’t get the nutrients it needs to help bones grow. It can increase your risk of fractures, breaks, and other injuries. Your organs also can sustain damage due to a lack of nutrients.

Without treatment, the female athlete triad can cause long-term health problems. When combined with a low body weight, it can even lead to death.","• How do I know if I have a problem?
• Could there be another reason for low energy or irregular periods?

144,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorders-fasd/,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a group of medical conditions that can occur in a person who was exposed to alcohol while in the womb. The problems can be physical, mental, or behavioral. They can range from mild to severe. They can start before the baby is born, or they may not be noticeable until childhood, adolescence or even adulthood. Diagnosable conditions under the FASD umbrella include Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND), Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD), and Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND-PAE).","FASD can cause a wide range of symptoms and often presents differently based on a multitude of factors. FASD is generally considered a brain-based disorder. Effects may include physical, mental, behavioral, and/or learning disabilities with lifelong implications. Symptoms in childhood may change as the child grows older. One of the most serious problems FASD can cause is developmental delay. FASD is the leading cause of preventable developmental delays in the United States.

The specific cognitive and behavioral impairments associated with FASD vary widely from one person to another and may include:

• Adaptive functioning (skills necessary for everyday living, such as reading social cues)
• Executive function (working memory, problem-solving, planning, and response inhibition)
• Deficits in motor skills (poor coordination)
• Attention issues, hyperactive behavior
• Problems with memory
• Learning challenges (especially with math)
• Sensory processing
• Speech and language delays
• Vision/hearing problems
• Sleep disturbance
• Intellectual disability or low IQ
• Impaired reasoning and judgment
• Problems with the heart, kidneys, or bones
• Shorter-than-average height
• Small head size
• Distinct facial features, such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip (this ridge is called the philtrum) and thin upper lip","FASDs can occur when a developing baby is exposed to alcohol before birth. This can happen even prior to a person recognizing that they are pregnant. Even small amounts of alcohol will pass across the placenta and to the fetus. The baby’s liver is not developed enough to be able to process the alcohol. The alcohol can damage the baby’s organs or cause other harm. Because no amount of alcohol can be considered safe, pregnant people should avoid all alcohol during the entire pregnancy.

“Binge drinking” (having 4 or more drinks at a time) is especially dangerous for your baby. It makes the level of alcohol in your blood (and the baby’s blood) go very high very quickly. Even if you don’t drink every day, you may put your baby at risk for FASD if you drink alcohol.

While drinking alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy can be the most dangerous, alcohol exposure remains unsafe throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy. Alcohol can interfere with development and cause birth defects. Drinking at any time during pregnancy is not safe and can harm your baby.","“FASD” is not a diagnostic term in the United States. However, a diagnosis can be made for a specified condition under the FASD umbrella. These conditions include: Fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, alcohol-related birth defects, and neurobehavioral disorders associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

Early diagnosis and early intervention significantly improve long-term outcomes for people with FASD. There is no simple diagnostic test for an FASD. Often, a multidisciplinary team is needed. Your doctor may look for physical symptoms, such as a low birth weight and a small head. Doctors may look at behavioral symptoms, such as attention and coordination. Fetal alcohol syndrome is diagnosed based on physical features alone, while other diagnoses may involve confirmation of alcohol exposure. Your doctor may try to confirm prenatal alcohol exposure, and if so, how much. PAE can be confirmed through interviews or review of patient files.

There are a multitude of reasons why it can be difficult to receive a diagnosis for an FASD. There is a lack of sufficient diagnostic capacity in most areas. Stigma is another barrier to diagnosis, as well as healthcare access. FASDs may have similar symptoms to other disorders and are often misdiagnosed.","FASDs are preventable if you are able to abstain from alcohol use throughout pregnancy. The healthiest approach is to stop drinking when you are planning to get pregnant. If you get pregnant, quit drinking alcohol right away. Drink other beverages instead, such as water or milk. Celebrate special occasions with a fun, non-alcoholic “mocktail.” Partners can be supportive by abstaining from alcohol during the pregnancy as well.

If you are pregnant and you have been drinking alcohol, be honest with your doctor. Tell them how much you are drinking. They may be able to help you stop drinking before it causes harm to your pregnancy and the developing fetus.","While there is no cure for FASD, there are many treatment options. While FASD presents lifelong challenges, there is help and hope for children and adults living with FASD. Treatment will vary greatly based on the specific diagnosis, the particular symptoms, and the environmental context. No one treatment is right for every child or adult. Early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes significantly. Physical treatments may include occupational therapy and medical and dental care. Behavioral symptoms can be treated with medicine and therapy. Developmental issues in childhood can be addressed through special education services. Parent/caregiver training and education is another potential treatment.

There are a number of evidence-based treatments developed for people with FASD. It is important that treatment providers be FASD-informed, and the parent/caregiver may be the one to inform and educate providers on FASD. Effective treatment can help to prevent some of the secondary disabilities associated with FASD, such as problems in school, trouble with the law, employment difficulties, and substance/alcohol abuse problems. Resources are available from FASD United by contacting a Family Navigator.","People living with FASD can thrive and succeed with the right services and support. Often, people with FASD will need ongoing therapy or special services, depending on their symptoms. Early diagnosis is associated with the most positive outcomes and allows doctors to create specialized plans for a person’s development and education.

In addition to early diagnosis, research shows that children with FASD do best if they:

• Are raised in a stable and nurturing home
• Are not exposed to violence or trauma
• Receive special education and social services

Everyone with FASD is unique, and people with FASD each have different particular challenges.

FASD is associated with an increased risk of having a mental health disorder, including:

• Depression and anxiety
• ADHD and hyperactivity
• Substance use disorders

FASD may lead to “secondary conditions.” A person is not born with a secondary condition but might develop one as a result of having an FASD. These may include:

• Disrupted school experience
• Trouble with the law
• Inappropriate sexual behavior
• Dependent living and problems with employment over 21 years

Remember that no amount of alcohol is safe during pregnancy. Quit drinking if you are trying to get pregnant or if you think you’re pregnant. If you can’t quit drinking by yourself, get help right away.","If your baby was born with fetal alcohol syndrome:

• What health concerns should I be aware of for my baby?
• Does my baby need treatment?
• How should I care for my baby at home?

If you are drinking during pregnancy:

• Am I putting my baby at risk for health problems?
• How much alcohol is too much? Can I have even one drink?
• I have a drinking problem. How do I stop?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs)

145,Fetal Growth Restriction,https://familydoctor.org/condition/intrauterine-growth-restriction/,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR), previously called intrauterine growth restriction, is a term that describes an unborn baby who isn’t growing at the normal rate inside the uterus. These babies usually have a low weight at birth.","Some babies are born smaller than normal. However, only about one-third of those babies were affected by growth restriction in pregnancy.

Small babies tend to run in families. The parents or other children in the family may have been small when they were born, too.

Babies who have FGR are more likely to have certain health problems (both during pregnancy and after birth), including:

• A difficult time handling the stress of vaginal delivery
• Increased risk of being stillborn
• Low blood sugar level at birth
• Lower resistance to infection
• Trouble maintaining body temperature
• An abnormally high red blood cell count","The most common cause of FGR is a problem before birth in the placenta (the tissue that carries oxygen, food, and blood to the baby). Birth defects and genetic disorders can also cause FGR.

A baby also may develop FGR if the mother:

• Has an infection
• Has high blood pressure
• Has kidney disease
• Has heart disease
• Has sickle cell anemia
• Has diabetes prior to pregnancy
• Smokes
• Drinks alcohol
• Abuses drugs

Sometimes a prescribed medicine the mother is taking causes FGR. Babies with genetic conditions such as Down syndrome are also more likely to have FGR.","During your pregnancy, your doctor will do tests to find out if your baby is growing normally.

The main test for checking a baby’s growth in the uterus is an ultrasound. The ultrasound exam lets your doctor see your baby in your uterus with an instrument that is moved across the outside of your abdomen.

While you’re having an ultrasound, your doctor will measure the size of your baby’s head, abdomen, and legs. These measurements will tell him or her if your baby is growing normally. Your doctor will also be able to see the amount of amniotic fluid in your uterus. In some babies who have FGR, the amount of amniotic fluid is low. If your baby is small, you may need more frequent ultrasound exams to check your baby’s health.

Another test to check inside your uterus is fetal monitoring. Monitoring devices are strapped over your uterus as you lie down for about 30 minutes. The devices record your baby’s heartbeat. Your doctor can look at the recording and see if your baby’s heartbeat is normal.

Your doctor might also order an amniocentesis. During this test, a needle is put through your skin into your uterus. A few teaspoons of amniotic fluid are withdrawn into the needle. The fluid is tested to see if it shows the cause of the FGR. The amniotic fluid can detect infection and some chromosomal abnormalities that can cause genetic problems.","If you smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use drugs, stop now. These things can cause FGR.

Having FGR in one pregnancy doesn’t mean it will happen the next time. If you do have another pregnancy affected by FGR, you may have an illness, such as hypertension. Good control of illnesses before and during pregnancy lowers the risk of FGR.","The best way to help your baby is to keep all your prenatal visits with your doctor. You should also monitor how often your baby moves and kicks. A baby who moves around often is usually healthy. A baby who doesn’t move very often or who stops moving may be sick. If you notice your baby isn’t moving as much, call your doctor right away.

Another way to help your baby is to take good care of your body. Eat healthy foods and make sure you eat the recommended number of calories for a pregnant woman. Try to get 8 hours of sleep (or more) each night. An hour or 2 of rest in the afternoon is also good for you. Rest will not only help you feel better, it may even help your baby grow.","If your baby has FGR, you may give birth early. The time of delivery depends on how well your baby is doing. Sometimes, babies with FGR appear to be small but healthy. If testing suggests that the pregnancy is not developing well, your doctor may decide that an early delivery could help. In this case, your doctor may want to induce labor. Your baby’s heart rate and movements will be closely watched to help you and your doctor make this decision.

If there are no signs of problems with your baby during labor, a vaginal delivery is okay. If your baby has problems during labor, a cesarean section (also called a C-section) may be safer.

A baby born with FGR usually needs to stay in the hospital longer after birth. This is especially true for babies born early. They need to breathe and feed normally before they can go home.

Babies born with FGR often catch up in size and have a normal height and weight by about 2 years of age. In the meantime, they should be fed normally without attempting to catch up quicker.","• Does my baby have fetal growth restriction (FGR)?

146,Fever in Infants and Children,https://familydoctor.org/condition/fever-in-infants-and-children/,"A fever is a sign that your body is sick or has an infection. A fever helps kill infections, bacteria and viruses that are causing the fever. Your child has a fever if his or her body temperature his higher than normal. A normal temperature is 98.6°F when checking by mouth. Some doctors ask you to check your baby or young child’s temperature rectally (in their bottom). Normal for that method is 99.6°F.","• Constant vomiting or diarrhea
• Dry mouth
• Earache or pulling at ears
• Fever comes and goes over several days
• High-pitched crying
• Fussiness
• No appetite
• Pale appearance
• Seizures
• Severe headache
• Skin rash
• Sore or swollen joints
• Sore throat
• Stiff neck
• Stomach pain
• Swelling of the soft spot on an infant’s head
• Unresponsiveness or limpness
• Wheezing or problems breathing
• Whimpering","Most fevers are caused by infections (bacteria or virus). Other reasons for a fever include:

• Certain medicines. This would include antibiotics, anti-seizure and blood pressure medicines.
• A heat-related illness.
• Cancers
• Autoimmune disorders (when your body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue).
• Some childhood vaccinations","Many doctors diagnose a fever as an oral temperature above 99.5°F. They diagnose fever as a rectal temperature above 100.4°F. But fever standards also depend on age, so what may be a fever in one person may not rate as a fever in someone else.

To take your child’s temperature rectally, use a digital thermometer. Place your child on his or her stomach across your lap. Apply petroleum jelly (brand name: Vaseline) to the tip of the thermometer. Insert it half an inch into your child’s bottom. Stop if you feel any resistance. Hold the thermometer still and do not let go. When the thermometer beeps, remove it and check the digital reading. Taking temperatures rectally is the preferred method for children.

To take your child’s temperature orally, use a digital thermometer. Place the end of the thermometer under his or her tongue. Go towards the back of the mouth. Have your child close his or her lips around the thermometer. Tell your child not to bite down or talk. When the thermometer beeps, remove it and check the digital reading.

Never use a mercury thermometer. Mercury is poison.

Other temperature-taking tips include:

• Label your rectal thermometer so that it isn’t accidentally used in your child’s mouth.
• Start by cleaning the thermometer in warm, soapy water. Rinse well with cool water.
• For oral temperatures, wait 20 minutes after your child eats or drinks hot or cold foods and drinks before taking his or her temperature.
• Don’t bundle your baby or child up too tightly before taking his or her temperature.
• Don’t take your child’s temperature right after he or she has had a bath.
• Never leave your child alone when using a thermometer.
• When you are finished, clean the thermometer again with rubbing alcohol or with cool, soapy water.",Fevers caused by illness or infection can be avoided by avoiding the things that cause illness and infection. Fevers caused by vaccinations can be avoided by giving your child acetaminophen. This is an over-the-counter medicine (brand name: Tylenol). This should be given just before or right after the vaccination.,"Acetaminophen can be given to reduce a fever. Ibuprofen (brand names Children’s Advil, Children’s Motrin) is another medicine that can be used to lower a fever in children older than 6 months of age. Ask your doctor for the correct dosage. This will vary by your child’s age and weight. Don’t give your child medicine if he or she is between 3 months and 3 years of age and has a temperature of 102°F or lower. If your child is achy and fussy, and his or her temperature is above 102°F (38.8°C), you may want to give him or her acetaminophen.","It’s important to make your child comfortable when he or she has a fever. Things that can help include:

• Give your child fluids to prevent dehydration (not enough fluid in the body). It will help the body cool itself. Water, clear soups, popsicles and flavored gelatin are good choices.
• Don’t force your child to eat if he or she doesn’t feel like it.
• Make sure your child gets plenty of rest.
• Keep the room temperature at about 70°F to 74°F.
• Dress your child in light cotton pajamas. Overdressing can trap body heat and cause your child’s temperature to rise.
• If your child has chills, give him or her an extra blanket. Remove it when the chills stop.","• Can I tell if my child has a fever by touching his forehead?
• How many days should a fever last before I should get concerned?
• Why does my child’s fever come and go?
• Can a high fever make my child confused?","U.S. National Library of Medicine, Fever

• Don’t give a baby younger than 2 months of age any medicine unless your doctor tells you to.
• Read package directions carefully.
• For liquid medicines, use a special measuring device to get the right dose. You can get one at your drug store. An ordinary kitchen teaspoon may not hold the right amount of medicine.

If your baby is younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4°F or higher, call the doctor or go to the emergency room. A fever can be a sign of a serious infection in young babies.

Never give your child aspirin for any reason. Aspirin can cause Reye’s syndrome. Reye’s syndrome is a serious childhood illness that can lead to death. Do not give aspirin to children younger than 18 years of age.

Giving your child acetaminophen and a warm bath may lower his or her fever. Give the acetaminophen before the bath. A bath without medicine will cause your child to shiver. This will raise his or her body temperature. Never use rubbing alcohol or cold water for baths."
147,Fibromyalgia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/fibromyalgia/,"Fibromyalgia is a syndrome that causes muscle pain and general fatigue. People who have fibromyalgia often have a heightened sensitivity to pain or experience chronic pain. This means it lasts a long time. Areas called “tender points” may be especially painful when pressure is put on them. Common tender points are the back of the head, the elbows, the shoulders, the knees, the hip joints, and around the neck.

Fibromyalgia is most common among people between 35 and 60 years of age. Women are more likely than men to have it.

Fibromyalgia is a condition that is often misunderstood. But your symptoms aren’t imagined. Scientific research has shown that fibromyalgia is a real syndrome that causes real pain. Don’t let anyone discourage you from getting a diagnosis and treatment for your symptoms.","Symptoms of fibromyalgia can include the following:

• Increased sensitivity to pain
• A deep ache or a burning pain that gets worse because of activity, stress, weather changes, or other factors
• Muscle stiffness or spasms
• Pain that moves around your body
• Feelings of numbness or tingling in your hands, arms, or legs
• Feeling very tired or fatigued (out of energy), even when you get enough sleep
• Trouble sleeping

People who have fibromyalgia often also have one or more of the following:

• Anxiety
• Depression
• Irritable bowel syndrome
• Restless legs syndrome
• Increased sensitivity to odors, bright lights, loud noises, or medicines
• Headaches, migraines, or jaw pain
• Dry eyes or mouth
• Dizziness and problems with balance
• Problems with memory or concentration (sometimes called the “fibro fog”)
• Painful menstrual periods

Several medicines can help reduce the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Many of these medicines are taken before bedtime and help reduce pain and improve sleep.

Your doctor may recommend an anti-depressant, such as duloxetine or milnacipran. Anti-seizure medicines, such as preglabin or gabapentin, may also be effective in managing your pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (which include ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen) are not usually effective in treating fibromyalgia when taken alone.","No. Although fibromyalgia causes symptoms that can be very painful and uncomfortable, your muscles and organs are not being damaged. This condition is not life-threatening. However, it is ongoing. Although there is no cure, there are many things you can do to feel better.

Doctors are not sure what causes fibromyalgia. This syndrome might be hereditary, which means it runs in families. You may have family members with similar symptoms.

There is a weak association between fibromyalgia and other life events, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These include:

• Illness or other diseases
• Stressful or traumatic events, such as car accidents
• Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
• Repetitive injuries
• Obesity
• Lupus
• Rheumatoid arthritis","Your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. Be sure to tell them whether any members of your immediate family have ever had similar symptoms or have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Your doctor will also need to know what medicines, vitamins, or supplements you are taking.

They will ask about your symptoms and how long you have had them. It’s very important to give your doctor a clear, detailed description of your symptoms. Before going to your appointment, write down a complete list of the problems you’ve been having. Be sure to describe exactly what type of pain you have (for example, whether the pain is dull or sharp) and where you have been feeling pain. Tell your doctor whether your pain comes and goes, and what makes you feel better or worse.

If you have had any trouble sleeping or are fatigued, tell your doctor how long you have had this problem. Your doctor may ask whether you have been feeling anxious or depressed since your symptoms began.

Your doctor will also perform a physical exam. This may include applying pressure to the tender points on your body. Your doctor may run blood tests to rule out any other conditions with symptoms similar to fibromyalgia. Your doctor will also want to be sure that there isn’t anything else causing your pain.

Unfortunately, it can take years for some people who have fibromyalgia to get a correct diagnosis. This can happen for many reasons. The main symptoms of fibromyalgia are pain and fatigue. These are also common symptoms of many other health problems, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.

Currently, there is no laboratory test or X-ray that can diagnose the condition.

It may take some time for your doctor to understand all of your symptoms and rule out other health problems so he or she can make an accurate diagnosis. As part of this process, your family doctor may consult with a rheumatologist. This type of doctor specializes in pain in the joints and soft tissue.",You cannot prevent fibromyalgia because no one is sure what causes it.,null,"There isn’t currently a cure for fibromyalgia. Your care will focus on helping you minimize the impact of the condition on your life and treating your symptoms. Your doctor can prescribe medicine to help with your pain, but there are other things you will need to do to ease your symptoms. This is called “self-management.”

Self-management means that you take responsibility for doing what it takes to manage fibromyalgia effectively. It’s important for you to be responsible for your health. The treatment recommendations your doctor makes won’t do any good unless you follow them. They can’t make decisions for you or make you change your behavior. Only you can do these things.

In self-management, you and your health care team are partners in care. Your health care team can provide valuable advice and information to help you deal with fibromyalgia. However, there isn’t one treatment plan that works best for every person who has fibromyalgia. You’ll have to work with your care team to create a plan that’s right for you and the quality of life you desire. After all, nobody knows more than you do about your feelings, your actions, and how your symptoms affect you.","• How do you know that fibromyalgia is causing my symptoms?
• What could have caused my fibromyalgia?
• Will I need to take medicines? Will they interact with other medicines I take?
• Will alternative therapies (massage, acupuncture, yoga, etc.) help relieve my symptoms?
• What should I do if my symptoms don’t respond to treatment or get worse?
• How do I talk to people about my condition? How do I explain that my pain is real?
• Are there any local support groups for people who have fibromyalgia?","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases: Fibromyalgia

It is also possible that the same chemical imbalances in the brain that cause mood changes also contribute to fibromyalgia.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition. This means that it affects you over a long period of time—possibly your entire life. There will be times when your fibromyalgia may “flare up” and your symptoms will be worse. Other times, you will feel much better. The good news is that your symptoms can be managed.

It’s important to have a health care team that understands fibromyalgia and has experience treating it. Your team will probably include your family doctor, a rheumatologist, and a physical therapist. Other health care professionals may help you manage other symptoms, such as mood or sleep problems. However, the most important member of your health care team is you. The more active you are in your care, the better you will feel."
148,Fifth Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/fifth-disease/,"Fifth disease is a mild viral infection caused by human parvovirus B19. It’s more common in children than adults. The disease got its name because it was fifth on a list of illnesses that caused rashes in children in the past. Fifth disease is sometimes called “slapped cheek disease.” The illness’s bright red rash on the face looks like the child has been slapped.

About half of people get fifth disease sometime during childhood or their teens. Once you’ve had it, you are unlikely to be at risk of getting it again.","The first signs of fifth disease are mild flu- or cold-like symptoms, including:

• Low-grade fever
• Sore throat
• Headache
• Stuffy or runny nose
• Fatigue

After a few days of these symptoms, your child may develop a bright red, raised rash on their face. The rash may then spread to the arms, legs, and trunk of the body. After 5 to 10 days, the rash usually fades. It fades from the center outward, making it look blotchy. It could show up again when your child gets hot or is out in the sun. This could go on for several weeks or months after the illness.

Adults who catch the virus usually don’t develop the rash. Instead, they’re more likely to experience joint pain or swelling. This usually happens in the hands, wrists, knees, and ankles. It can last several months, but usually gets better after 1 to 2 weeks. Some adults who get fifth disease don’t experience any symptoms.

Symptoms usually show up 4 to 14 days after exposure. The rash may not appear for as long as 3 weeks. Once your child has the rash, they are not contagious anymore.","Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19. This isn’t the same parvovirus that can infect dogs and cats. It’s spread when you or your child comes into contact with saliva or mucus carrying the virus. It can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or sharing items. It can also be spread through blood. A pregnant woman who has this disease could pass it to her baby.","Your doctor can usually tell if your child has this disease by seeing the “slapped cheek” rash. A blood test can be used, but it’s not usually needed.","There is no vaccine for fifth disease. You can prevent your child from getting it by helping them practice good hygiene habits. These include:

• Washing hands often with soap and water
• Covering the mouth and nose with their elbow when coughing or sneezing
• Not touching the eyes, nose, or mouth
• Avoiding close contact with anyone who is sick
• Keeping them home when they are sick","Most cases of fifth disease are mild. It usually goes away without treatment. You can treat fever and flu symptoms in your child with acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol).

Adults who have joint pain or swelling may need to rest and restrict activity. They may want to take medicines like acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (brand names: Advil or Motrin) for the pain.","Most children and adults who get fifth disease recover completely and have no complications. But this disease can cause problems in certain cases:

• Pregnant women who have been exposed to fifth disease should call their doctor. In about 5% of pregnant women, the baby can develop severe anemia. When this happens, miscarriage or stillbirth can occur. The mother can take medicines to treat the virus. In some cases, the unborn baby might need a blood transfusion. If you’re pregnant, talk to your doctor about fifth disease. They can tell you if you need to take any special steps to avoid the virus. The infection doesn’t cause birth defects or developmental problems.
• Weak immune system. People who have immune system problems may need special treatment to help fight fifth disease. This includes people who have had organ transplants, or who have cancer or HIV.
• Chronic anemia. People with sickle-cell disease or other types of chronic anemia could have problems if they get this illness. They could develop severe anemia that requires blood transfusions.","• I’m pregnant. What do I need to do to keep my baby safe?
• What treatment is best for me?
• How long will I be contagious?
• How long should I keep my child home from school?
• What can I do to make my child more comfortable?
• Should I tell my child’s school that he/she has fifth disease?
• My rash keeps coming back when I spend time outside. Is that normal?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Fifth Disease

149,Flat Feet,https://familydoctor.org/condition/flat-feet/,"Flat feet is a common condition in which one or both feet don’t have normal arches. At first, all babies’ feet look flat because an arch hasn’t formed yet. Arches should form by the time a child is 2 or 3 years of age. Flat feet, even in older children, usually do not cause any problems.

You may be born with flat feet or develop them over time. Adults may not realize they have flat feet for many years. They may not ever notice if they don’t have symptoms related to flat feet.","If your child complains of foot or ankle pain, take them to the doctor. Flat feet in an older child may cause pain in the heel or arch. This condition also may cause pain when your child is walking and running.

Symptoms in adults of flat feet include tired or achy feet after long periods of standing. Feet may also ache following activity, like playing sports or exercising. Flat feet can also cause pain in your lower back, hips, and knees.","In children, most flat feet are caused by loose joint connections and baby fat between the foot bones. These conditions make the arch fall when your child stands up. This is why you sometimes hear flat feet called “fallen arches.” The feet may look like they have arches when your child is sitting or when the big toe is bent backward. But the arch flattens when your child puts weight on the foot.

Rarely, flat feet can be caused by foot bones that are joined together.

In adults, a number of things can cause flat feet. Adult-acquired causes for flat feet include:

• Weakened or torn tendons. Tendons offer support to your arches. If you tear a tendon or even weaken it over time, it can cause flat feet.
• Rheumatoid arthritis. This type of arthritis can progressively cause deformities in your joints. These deformities can cause flat feet.
• Broken bones. Damaging bones in your mid foot can cause flat feet.
• Ligament injuries. Ligaments support your bones. An injury to these can impact your joints, which can cause flat feet.","Your doctor will look at your child’s feet to make sure that the pain isn’t caused by a problem in the hip or the knee. Your child may need to have X-rays. Most often, your doctor probably can tell you what the problem is just by looking at your child’s feet.

If you have adult-acquired flat feet, your doctor should be able to diagnose it by examining your feet. They may ask you to stand and will observe your feet from various angles. Your doctor also may ask you to stand on your toes. Your doctor may also order tests, such as X-ray, MRI, or CT scan to diagnose your flat feet.",Adult flat feet can sometimes be prevented through good foot care. Taking care of your feet and avoiding injury are important. You may be at higher risk for developing flat feet if you have diabetes or are pregnant. You are also more likely to develop flat feet if you are overweight.,"For many people, flat feet don’t cause pain or related problems so there is usually no need to treat them. If flat feet are painful, there are several treatment options. Some of these include:

• Stretching exercises
• Physical therapy
• Supportive shoes
• Arch supports
• Surgery

Your doctor can help you decide which treatment is best.

Your child’s foot development will be the same whether arch supports are worn or not. High-top or special orthopedic shoes, “cookies,” or wedges are only useful to keep the shoe on your child’s foot. If your child has foot pain because of flat feet, a heel cup, shoe insert, or shoes with support may help.

People with flat feet don’t need to limit activities. If flat feet become painful from overuse, your doctor may recommend you rest them. Wearing a certain style of shoe, walking barefoot, running, doing foot exercises, or jumping will not make flat feet better or worse.

If you or your child has pain from flat feet, some over-the-counter medicines may help, including ibuprofen (one brand name: Advil) and naproxen (one brand name: Aleve).","Flat feet are common. If flat feet cause you pain, talk to your doctor. Most of the time, this pain can be managed with rest. Supportive footwear can also help.","• What is the likely cause of my/my child’s foot pain?
• What is the best treatment option for me/my child?
• Is there anything I can do to help relieve my/my child’s pain?
• Is it safe for me/my child to exercise? What kind of exercise should I/they do?
• Will my/my child’s flat feet cause any long-term problems?","National Institute of Health, MedlinePlus: Flat Feet

150,Flatulence/Gas,https://familydoctor.org/condition/flatulence-gas/,"Flatulence is another name for gas. You’ve experienced it. In fact, it’s normal for people pass gas several times a day.

Gas happens when air accumulates in your stomach or intestines. It often happens after eating a meal. The accumulated air needs to get out of your body. Sometimes it leaves through your mouth; that’s a burp. When it leaves your body through your anus, that’s gas. Also, when gas leaves through your anus, it contains sulfur. That’s why gas is sometimes stinky.","The most common symptom of gas is bloating. That’s an uncomfortable, swollen feeling in your abdomen. It is caused by the air that’s still in your intestines. Another symptom of gas is actually passing gas. Once you pass gas, the bloating feeling should go away.","Different people get gas for different reasons. But there are several main causes for gas.

Too much air. When you eat, you swallow a small amount of air. This air travels to your stomach and intestines during the digestion process. If it stays in your intestines, it can cause gas. There are certain times you swallow more air than usual. They include when you:

• Suck on hard candies or chew gum.
• Drink soda or other carbonated beverages.
• Smoke.
• Eat too fast.

What you eat. You can also get gas because of what you eat. Sometimes, your stomach and small intestine don’t break down all the foods you eat, especially the fibers, sugars, and starches. These pass from your stomach and small intestine into your large intestine. There, bacteria that live in your large intestine break them down. This process creates gas. Some foods are known to cause gas. They include:

• apples
• asparagus
• beans
• bread
• broccoli and cauliflower
• cereal
• cheese
• whole wheat products

Medical conditions. You may be more likely to have gas if you have certain medical conditions. Some of them include:

• Celiac disease, an immune disorder.
• Gastroesophageal reflux disease (also known as GERD).
• Irritable bowel syndrome (also known as IBS).
• Trouble digesting milk products (also known as lactose intolerance).
• An overgrowth of bacteria in your small intestine.

Additionally, some antibiotic medicines can cause gas.","Your doctor will talk with you about your symptoms, medical history, and what you’ve eaten recently. He or she will likely do a physical exam of your abdomen and note if you’re bloated. Your doctor also may listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope.

If you have repeated pain from gas, your doctor may ask you to keep a food diary. To do this, you can use any paper or notebook to keep track of all the foods you eat. You’ll also need to note when you have gas. Then when you go back to the doctor, take your food diary with you. The information you’ve recorded will help you and your doctor figure out what foods are causing your gas.

In some instances, your doctor may order other tests to see if you have a medical condition that’s causing your gas.","Everybody has gas from time to time. However, if you have gas on a regular basis, there are some things you can do to prevent it, such as avoiding certain foods and eating slowly.","• Once you know what foods trigger gas for you, eat small amounts of those foods or avoid them all together.
• Eat slowly. This will decrease the amount of air you swallow.
• Chew your food completely.
• Avoid using a straw. Straws make you swallow more air.
• Eat smaller, more frequent meals.
• Stop smoking.
• Take a walk 10-15 minutes after you eat. This will help your body digest your food properly and reduce the chance of getting gas.

If you have gas, you may want to take an over-the-counter medicine to help you feel better. Some medicines need to be taken before you eat, while others can be taken afterward. Talk with your doctor about which medicines are best for you. If your gas is more serious or related to a medical condition, your doctor may prescribe a prescription medicine for you to take.","While having gas can be uncomfortable, it usually goes away on its own and isn’t a big cause for concern. However, call your doctor if you have gas and:

• Bloody, oily stools.
• Vomiting.
• Fever.
• Pain elsewhere in your body.
• Sudden change of symptoms or weight loss.","• Why do I have gas?
• What medicines can I take to help relieve my gas?
• What can I do at home to feel better when I have gas?
• What can I do to feel better when I feel bloated?
• Do I need to keep a food diary?","National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Gas in the Digestive Tract

151,Food Poisoning,https://familydoctor.org/condition/food-poisoning/,"Food poisoning (also known as food-borne illness) occurs when you eat or drink something that contains harmful germs (bacteria, viruses, or parasites). Bacteria produce a toxin in food. It’s this toxin that causes the problem.","Symptoms of can begin hours or days after consuming contaminated food or drink. The timing depends in part on the cause of the food poisoning. It can also depend on the amount of food or drink you consumed. Symptoms may include:

• Abdominal pain
• Diarrhea
• Fever
• Loss of appetite
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Weakness and fatigue

Food poisoning may affect just one person or a whole group of people who are exposed to the contaminated food or drink. It depends on how much of the germ or toxin each person consumed. It also depends on how sensitive they are to the germ or toxin.","Many foods can cause food poisoning. Foods that should be kept cool but often are not are some of the primary causes. That is why food poisoning is more common at picnics and buffets. There, food (such as the mayonnaise in potato salad) is often left out of the refrigerator for a long time.

Other common sources of food poisoning include:

• Raw or undercooked meat or poultry
• Unpasteurized dairy products
• Raw shellfish
• Unwashed fruits and vegatables

Most cases of food poisoning are caused by food contaminated by bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli. Food can also be contaminated by a virus, such as the norovirus.","Many cases of food poisoning never get an official diagnosis. This is because most people recover within a few days at home. If you have severe symptoms of food poisoning, your doctor will diagnose you. They may order a blood test to determine if the food poisoning is caused by bacteria. Or, they may collect a stool sample to find out what germ is causing the food poisoning.

I advise my pregnant patients to prevent Listeria infection by avoiding high-risk foods and following basic food safety guidelines. Read More","The best way to prevent food poisoning is to always know what you are eating. The best way to always know what you are eating is to eat at home. You can better control food storage and preparation at home. When dining out, be cautious of buffets.

You can take a few simple steps to avoid food poisoning:

• Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly.
• Clean countertops, cutting boards, knives, and utensils before exposing them to different food items.
• Wash your hands and utensils often.
• When thawing meats, do so in the refrigerator. Do not thaw them at room temperature.
• Don’t put raw and cooked meats on the same plate.
• If knives have been used to cut up uncooked chicken, do not use them to cut up other ingredients that will not be cooked.
• Cook meat thoroughly. Use a meat thermometer if needed. Make sure beef is cooked to at least 160°F, chicken and other poultry to 180°F, and fish to 140°F.
• Don’t use packaged food that has expired.
• Throw away food in bulging or dented cans.
• Refrigerate leftover food if it isn’t going to be eaten within 4 hours.
• Don’t eat wild mushrooms.
• Don’t eat soft cheeses (especially imported) if you are pregnant or have a weak immune system.
• When traveling abroad, don’t eat raw fruits or vegetables that haven’t been washed in an antimicrobial rinse. Avoid unfiltered (or unboiled) tap water.
• When at restaurants or social gatherings, avoid foods that have been left out of the refrigerator for long periods of time.

To avoid ciguatera poisoning, don’t eat the fish that commonly carry the poison. This includes amberjack, grouper, snapper, sturgeon, king mackerel, barracuda, and moray eel. The poison is more concentrated in a fish’s internal organs, so you should never eat those parts of a fish.

To avoid scombroid poisoning, don’t eat any fish that has not been refrigerated properly. Be especially careful when you eat fish such as tuna, sardines, mackerel, mahi-mahi, or anchovies.","Most cases of food poisoning are mild and clear up in a few days. During that time, the goal is to prevent dehydration. Dehydration is the loss of fluids and electrolytes (nutrients and minerals) your body needs. You should avoid solid foods and dairy products until the vomiting and diarrhea have passed. Once you are feeling better, ease into eating and drinking again. Try bland foods, such as crackers, toast, and bananas. Avoid spicy foods, fried foods, dairy, and foods that are high in fat and sugar. Drink plenty of fluids but avoid milk or caffeinated beverages. Also, sports drinks (brand name: Gatorade, others) are not meant to be used to treat diarrhea. They do not replace the body’s electrolytes (salts and minerals) correctly to prevent dehydration.

Ciguatera poisoning is treated with medicines that help ease your symptoms. There is no medicine that will cure ciguatera poisoning. The symptoms will go away on their own over time. Scombroid poisoning is treated using an antihistamine (one brand: Benadryl). An antihistamine is a medicine that blocks the histamine in your blood.","Food poisoning comes and goes, however, one person may be more likely to get it than another.

Children and the elderly are most likely to get food poisoning. You may also be at a higher risk if you:

• Have a chronic medical condition, such as kidney disease or diabetes
• Are pregnant
• Recently traveled to areas outside the United States. You may have had greater exposure to germs that can cause food poisoning
• Have a weakened immune system. This could be caused by drugs taken after an organ transplant, certain chemotherapy medicines, or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).","• How do I know if my symptoms are caused by food poisoning?
• Are there medicines that prevent food poisoning?
• How long will it take me to recover from food poisoning?
• Is food poisoning dangerous? When should I call you?
• How is food poisoning different from other digestive disorders?
• Do I have a food allergy?
• How long will I feel sick with a Vibrio vulnificus infection?
• I have kidney disease. Should I avoid eating shellfish?

This information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone. Talk to your family doctor to find out if this information applies to you and to get more information on this subject.

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","There are two types of food poisoning you can get from eating fish: ciguatera poisoning and scombroid poisoning.

Ciguatera poisoning symptoms include abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms can progress to headache, muscle aches, and itchy, tingly, or numbness of the skin. One early sign can be numbness of the lips, tongue, or area around the mouth. You may have a metallic taste or feel like your teeth are loose. You may notice a change in your ability to feel hot or cold temperatures. For example, you may think something feels hot when it is actually cold.

Scombroid poisoning symptoms develop 20 to 30 minutes after you eat the affected fish. They include flushing (turning red) of the face, nausea, vomiting, hives, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are similar to other allergic reactions. Getting scombroid poisoning does not mean you are allergic to fish.

Vibrio vulnificus infection is a bacterial infection to warm, seawater fish. It’s found in shellfish (especially oysters), other seafood, or the ocean. You can get it by eating contaminated fish. You can also get it from contact with a fish or the ocean (through an open cut). It is not common and not contagious. The symptoms are similar to those of general food poisoning: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. More serious symptoms include a high fever, chills, low blood pressure, redness, swelling, and blisters on your skin. If the bacteria enters an open cut, it can become a more serious infection. Once that happens, it can spread through your bloodstream and become life-threatening. Blood and stool tests lead to a diagnosis. Your doctor also may look at the blisters on your skin.

You can reduce your risk of exposure by not eating undercooked shellfish and other seafood. Wash kitchen utensils in hot, soapy water. Wear gloves when handling the fish if you have an open cut. Avoid ocean water until your cut or wound has healed.

Antibiotics are often used to treat the infection. In severe cases, you may need surgery or amputation where a cut or wound was infected with the bacteria.

Make an appointment with your doctor if:

• Severe diarrhea lasts for more than 3 days
• Frequent vomiting lasts for more than 2 days
• There is blood in your stool
• You are on diuretics and have diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting
• You have a fever over 101°F

• Notice your stool is maroon or black or you see a lot of blood in your stool
• Are vomiting blood
• Are having trouble breathing
• Have severe abdominal pain or stomach cramping
• Have double vision or trouble moving parts of your body
• Feel like your heart is pounding
• Have symptoms of severe dehydration (see the list below)
• Are having trouble swallowing
• Have food poisoning from eating mushrooms or shellfish

The symptoms of ciguatera poisoning can last for 1 to 2 weeks. Exactly how long they last will depend on the amount of poison you have in your body. Symptoms of scombroid poisoning usually last for 24 hours or less, but symptoms can come back any time you eat fish that has not been refrigerated properly. Ciguatera and scombroid poisoning are rarely fatal.

Symptoms of dehydration include:

• Little or no urine, or urine that is darker than usual
• Dry mouth
• Sleepiness or fatigue
• Extreme thirst
• Headache
• Confusion
• Feeling dizzy or lightheaded
• No tears when crying

To treat mild dehydration, try taking frequent sips of water. Clear soups, clear sodas, and juice mixed with water can also help. Avoid coffee, tea, dark sodas, and other caffeinated drinks. These drinks can make dehydration worse. Give children who have mild dehydration water and/or an oral rehydration solution (ORS). An ORS contains the right mix of salt, sugar, potassium, and other nutrients to help replace lost body fluids. You can buy an ORS at most grocery stores and drugstores. If your dehydration is severe, you may need to be treated in the hospital. There, doctors will give you intravenous (through an IV) fluids and electrolytes.

It can be. Dehydration can be dangerous, and so can certain types of food poisoning. Food poisoning caused by the Listeria bacteria can be very dangerous for the unborn babies of pregnant women. The infection is usually very mild for the mother, but can cause miscarriage, premature labor, stillbirth, and developmental problems in their babies. People who have weakened immune systems are also at risk of developing complications from Listeria. Food poisoning caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS can cause kidney failure, especially in people who have weakened immune systems."
152,Food Poisoning | Mushroom Poisoning Symptoms,https://familydoctor.org/condition/food-poisoning-mushroom-poisoning/,People are poisoned each year after eating mushrooms from their yard or outside locations. These mushrooms should not be eaten. It’s difficult to tell which mushrooms can be eaten and which cannot. Poisonous mushrooms can make you sick. Some are actually deadly.,"• Nausea
• Stomach cramps
• Vomiting
• Diarrhea (sometimes bloody)
• Headache
• Dizziness
• Flushing (warm and red) in the face and abdomen
• Heart palpitations

More serious symptoms include:

• Seizures
• Hallucinations
• Problems breathing
• Kidney/liver failure
• Death

Symptoms can appear right after eating the poisonous mushroom. Or they could appear several hours later. Symptoms that occur within 2 hours are less dangerous than those that appear later (after 6 hours).",Eating poisonous mushrooms causes mushroom poisoning.,"Mushroom poisoning is difficult to diagnose. Your doctor will examine you. They will ask you about your symptoms and when and what you ate recently. The diagnosis is based on the information you provide. If you are able to get a sample of the mushroom you know was eaten, bring it with you to the doctor or emergency department.","You can avoid mushroom poisoning by not eating mushrooms picked from the ground. It’s difficult to tell which mushrooms are poisonous and which are not. They can be growing next to each other. There are no tests to tell a poisonous mushroom from a nonpoisonous mushroom. Assume all wild mushrooms are poisonous. It’s best to buy them from the store.

Mushrooms that grow in the ground are more dangerous than mushrooms that grow on living trees. Additionally, mushrooms growing in lawns have likely been exposed to pesticides and other lawn-care chemicals. Mushrooms on the ground in forests are more dangerous than mushrooms in yards. Cooking poisonous mushrooms will not remove the toxins.","If you suspect that you or someone you are with has mushroom poisoning, call your doctor. Or call the Poison Control Center. Call 911 if the person is unconscious, not breathing, or having convulsions. The phone number for the Poison Control Center is 1-800-222-1222. This number is answered 24 hours a day. It’s a good idea to keep this number in your phone contacts. Take the person to the emergency room. If possible, bring a few of the mushrooms the person ate with you to the doctor or the emergency room.

If the person has thrown up, the worst is probably over. Doctors may give the person activated charcoal to cause vomiting. The doctor will check the person’s temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. They will be watched closely for severe symptoms and complications. The person will be sent home if they have no symptoms of severe poisoning, and if the mushroom is proven harmless. Your doctor will ask you to watch the person for any symptoms of mushroom poisoning for the next 24 hours.

Of special note: Decades ago, people were encouraged to keep ipecac syrup in their homes to induce vomiting in case of poisoning. However, current research shows that ipecac syrup is unsafe to use and is not effective. It can no longer be purchased. Bottom line: Do not use it if someone has it and gives it to you.",Short-term effects of living with mushroom poisoning are unpleasant. These are things related to vomiting and diarrhea. More severe symptoms may take longer to recover or cause permanent damage.,"• Are poisonous mushrooms dangerous for my pets?

153,Fragile X Syndrome | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/fragile-x-syndrome/,"Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder. It is most often passed on from a parent to a child at the time the child is conceived. The disorder causes intellectual and developmental disabilities. This means it affects a person’s learning and physical growth. It also affects behavior and being able to relate to other people. The symptoms of Fragile X syndrome can be mild or moderate. It affects both girls and boys; however, it is often milder in girls.","There are many symptoms that go along with Fragile X syndrome. These include:

• Developmental: Many children have delays in sitting, crawling, walking, and speech in early childhood. The delays grow as the child gets older.
• Intellectual: School-aged children are below grade level in reading, math, and other subjects. They have trouble learning new things and could have mild to severe intellectual disability.
• Behavioral: They often have behavior problems. These could include trouble paying attention or being afraid or anxious. Both boys and girls may be shy or aggressive. They may also have social challenges. These could include difficulties making eye contact and interacting with others.
• Speech and language: Boys especially may have problems speaking clearly, stuttering, or leaving out parts of words. Some children have a delay in talking. A few may never talk at all.
• Sensory: Many people are sensitive to noise, light, or other sensory information.

A person diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome may have certain physical features, as well. These include:

• Larger-than-normal ears, jaw, and forehead
• A long, narrow face
• Flat feet
• Unusually flexible fingers

Men who have Fragile X syndrome may have larger-than-normal testicles after puberty. Women may experience infertility and enter menopause earlier than normal. Both men and women with Fragile X syndrome can have tremors (shaking) and difficulty with coordination. Some people will experience seizures.","Fragile X syndrome is caused by a problem with one of your genes. The normal gene makes a protein that is needed for brain development. But when there is a problem with that gene, it has trouble making the protein. This causes the symptoms that come with the disorder.

Most of the time, children inherit the gene from their parents. That is how Fragile X syndrome is passed on. However, it is possible to have Fragile X even if a child’s parents don’t have the Fragile X gene.","Some parents notice the developmental delays in their child and see their doctor. This leads to testing. A simple blood test can detect the Fragile X gene in your child any time after he or she is born. That confirms the diagnosis. Most children are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 4.

If you suspect or know either parent has the Fragile X gene, prenatal testing can determine if the baby has the gene before it is born. This could include amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Prenatal testing can help families prepare for a baby with Fragile X syndrome so they can start treatment as early as possible. But most parents don’t know they carry the gene, so prenatal testing is uncommon.","Since Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder, it cannot be prevented or avoided.","There is no cure for Fragile X syndrome. Certain therapies can help with the symptoms of the disorder. This includes physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Special education services can help with academic and learning challenges. They also can help with behavior. A young child’s brain is still growing. So, the earlier a child with Fragile X syndrome receives therapy, the better.","Living with Fragile X syndrome is similar to living with any type of intellectual disability. Therapies and special education are designed to help the person to be as independent as possible. Independence depends on the severity of the diagnosis. For mild cases, the earlier the person receives therapy, the better their chances of being independent as they become an adult.","• If I carry the Fragile X syndrome gene, how likely is it I will pass it on to my child?
• If I have one child with Fragile X syndrome, am I at a higher risk of having other children with the disease?
• If I notice delays in my child’s development, how long should I wait before seeing a doctor?
• Are there any medical conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome (heart, hearing, vision)?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: About Fragile X Syndrome

154,Galactorrhea,https://familydoctor.org/condition/galactorrhea/,"Galactorrhea occurs when one or both breasts make milk or a milky discharge. It’s not related to milk production in breastfeeding. The breasts may leak only when touched, or on their own. It can occur in women or in men but is less common in men. Rarely, it can occur in newborns.

Galactorrhea is not a disease but can be a symptom of an underlying health problem.","The main symptom of galactorrhea is a milky white discharge from one or both nipples. Sometimes, the discharge is yellow or greenish in color. Blood in the discharge is not a symptom. If you have blood in the breast discharge, you should contact your doctor.

Other related symptoms may include:

• An absence of menstrual periods or periods that aren’t regular
• Headaches
• Vision loss
• Decreased sex drive
• Increase in hair growth on your chin or chest
• Erectile dysfunction in men","There are many possible causes of galactorrhea. Someone who has it most likely has an underlying condition. Possible causes include:

• Pregnancy
• Oral birth control pills
• Over stimulation of the breasts, such as during sexual activity
• Frequent (daily) breast self-exams
• Clothing that irritates the breasts (may include scratchy wool shirts or bras that don’t fit well)
• Pituitary tumors. Often these are located in the pituitary gland in the brain. Most tumors are benign, meaning not cancerous.
• Certain medicines. These can include hormones, antidepressants, blood pressure medicines, and sedatives
• Herbal supplements. These can include nettle, fennel, blessed thistle, anise, and fenugreek seed
• Drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, and opiates
• Kidney disease
• An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). The thyroid is a gland that produces hormones.
• Injury or trauma to your chest or spinal cord

In some cases, the cause of galactorrhea is unknown.","Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They will ask about your health history and lifestyle, and what medicines you take. Your doctor may order blood tests to check your hormone levels. For women, your doctor may order a pregnancy test. If the doctor suspects a tumor, they can order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This test scans your head to see if you have a tumor or defect of the pituitary gland. Your doctor can order a mammogram and/or ultrasound to check for cancer.","You can’t prevent galactorrhea. However, once you know the cause, you may be able to avoid it.","Treatment depends on the cause of galactorrhea. Benign tumors can be treated with medicine or surgery. Medicine can help if your body is producing too much of a hormone, such as prolactin. It also helps treat problems, such as hypothyroidism. If a certain medicine causes galactorrhea, your doctor may prescribe a different medicine.","In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Over time, the condition may go away on its own. Until then, there are some things you can do to help.

• Avoid stimulating your breasts.
• Avoid touching your nipples during sexual activity.
• Don’t do breast self-exams more than once a month.
• Avoid clothes that are too tight or rub and irritate your skin.
• Wear pads in your bra (women) to absorb the milky discharge.","• How do tests help diagnose galactorrhea?

155,Gallstones,https://familydoctor.org/condition/gallstones/,"Gallstones are hard deposits that can form inside the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ just under your liver. It stores bile, the digestive fluid that is made by the liver. Sometimes the bile becomes solid and forms stones. Some are as small as a grain of sand. Others can be the size of a golf ball.","Most people who have gallstones never experience symptoms. These are called silent gallstones. Sometimes, a gallstone can leave your gallbladder and go into a bile duct. Sometimes a gallstone gets stuck in that passageway and blocks it completely. If this happens, you may experience severe pain in the right upper part of your belly or in your upper back.

This is known as a gallbladder attack. The pain usually starts suddenly and lasts for several hours. Complete or partial blockage can also cause your gallbladder to get irritated and inflamed.

• Have pain that lasts several hours
• Develop a fever
• Vomit or feel nauseated

In addition, your skin may turn a yellowish color, known as jaundice.

Gallbladder attacks tend to happen after heavy meals. They’re more likely to happen in the evening or during the night. They stop when the gallstones move and are no longer lodged in the duct. If the duct remains blocked for more than a few hours, complications can occur. Call your doctor right away if you’re experiencing a gall bladder attack that lasts more than several hours.","Most gallstones are made of cholesterol. Normally, acids in the bile break down cholesterol. But a high-fat diet can lead the liver to produce extra cholesterol that the acids can’t break down. This leads the excess cholesterol to solidify.

Other gallstones are made of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment in bile that is produced when red blood cells break down. These stones are formed when there is too much bilirubin in the bile.

Gallstones may also form if the gallbladder doesn’t empty itself completely.

You’re more likely to get gallstones if you:

• Are a woman
• Are more than 60 years of age
• Have diabetes
• Have a family history of gallstones
• Are pregnant
• Take birth control pills
• Eat a diet high in fat
• Are overweight or have obesity
• Are on a low-calorie diet and have recently lost weight very quickly","Gallstones can be hard to diagnose because they share symptoms with other conditions. Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs of gallstones. This will include looking for yellowing of the skin and tenderness in the abdomen. They may order blood tests. They may also order imaging tests. These could include an ultrasound or CT scan, which will make pictures of your gallbladder and bile ducts. If your doctor thinks you have a gallstone stuck in a bile duct, they could try to remove the stone.","Eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding rapid weight loss can reduce your risk of gallstones. A healthy diet should include good sources of fiber like raw fruits and vegetables or beans and whole-grain foods. Avoid eating too much saturated fat.","Your treatment depends on the severity of your symptoms and what the doctor finds from the tests.

• No treatment. If the gallstones are floating free and you have no pain, you won’t need treatment.
• Wait and see. If you have one gallbladder attack, your doctor may want to take a wait-and-see approach. The problem may solve itself. Then if you have more attacks, your doctor may recommend surgery.
• Surgery. Once you have one gallbladder attack, the chance of having another one is high (up to 70%). Many doctors will suggest surgery to remove your gallbladder to prevent a future attack. If your gallbladder is irritated or inflamed, most doctors will want to take it out right away. The surgery is most often done with laparoscopic surgery. This means that small tools are inserted into small incisions in your abdomen to remove your gallbladder. The surgery is safe and effective. It limits your hospital stay to about 1 day. Without surgery, the gallbladder can get infected. It might even burst, causing further problems.

Other treatments are available for people who would have a high risk in surgery. This could be because they are elderly, or have heart problems or lung disease. However, gallstones usually return when they aren’t treated with surgery. Other options include:

• Sound wave therapy. This can break up the stones so they can move into the intestine without problem. But not everyone can receive this treatment. If you have more than 1 gallstone, if your gallstone is large, or if you have other medical conditions, you may not be able to receive sound wave therapy.
• Medicine. You might be able to take a pill to dissolve the stones. This pill doesn’t work for everyone and can be expensive. It can take 2 years or longer to work, and gallstones could return after you finish treatment.

Surgery is the best way to cure symptomatic gallstones. Talk with your doctor about what is right for you.","If your gallstones aren’t causing symptoms, you may live the rest of your life without any problems. If you do experience symptoms, your doctor may want to remove your gallbladder. You don’t need your gallbladder to live. So when it’s removed, you won’t notice much difference. You may have diarrhea at first. If you have diarrhea that lasts more than 3 months after surgery, talk to your doctor. Some people may find they need to eat a lower-fat diet.","• Are there lifestyle changes I can make to prevent gallstones?
• Am I at risk of having another gallstone?
• What should I do if I have a gallbladder attack?
• Is there any kind of medicine that will make a gallbladder attack less painful?

156,Gastroparesis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/gastroparesis/,"Gastroparesis is a disorder involving your stomach muscles. It is sometimes called delayed gastric emptying. Normally, after you swallow food, your stomach muscles begin squeezing and tightening. These movements are called contractions. This crushes the food and moves it into the small intestine to continue the digestive process. If you have gastroparesis, your stomach muscles don’t contract properly. This can delay or prevent the process of crushing the food and sending it to the small intestine.","Symptoms of gastroparesis can be mild or severe, and may include:

• Heartburn or stomach pain
• Nausea
• Vomiting, especially vomiting pieces of undigested food
• Feeling full after only a few bites of food
• Bloating
• Lack of appetite
• Unintended weight loss
• Unstable blood sugar levels (in people who have diabetes)

These symptoms are related to a lot of different problems and disorders. This makes gastroparesis hard to diagnose.","People who have diabetes are most at risk for gastroparesis. That’s because high blood sugar levels damage your nerves. In this case, it’s your vagus nerve. The vagus nerve tells your stomach muscles when to contract. Damage to this nerve is one of the most common causes of gastroparesis. Diabetes also can damage the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the vagus nerve. Other things that cause gastroparesis include:

• Certain medicines. This includes certain pain medicines, antidepressants, and others.
• Surgery on the esophagus (the tube that runs from the mouth to the stomach), the stomach or the upper small intestine.
• Radiation of the chest or stomach for cancer treatment.
• Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia.
• Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
• Other disorders, including hypothyroidism, scleroderma, Parkinson’s disease and some autoimmune disorders.
• Viral infections such as the flu (this is rare).","Your doctor will examine you and ask about your medical history. Tell your doctor about any prescription or over-the-counter medicines you are taking. Your doctor may order blood tests to check the quality of your blood and measure chemical levels. They might want to do additional tests to make sure you don’t have a blockage or another medical problem. These tests may include:

• Upper endoscopy (EGD). Your doctor uses a flexible tube with a light at the end to look inside your throat, your esophagus and into your stomach. You will probably be given medicine to make you sleep during the test. Your throat also will be numbed so that you don’t feel pain.
• Gastric emptying ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to look at the organs in your abdomen (your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas) so your doctor can check for signs of problems.
• Barium X-ray. When your stomach is mostly empty, you drink a liquid that contains a small, safe amount of the chemical barium. The doctor can watch the barium travel through your body during an X-ray. This helps your doctor figure out where the problem is occurring.
• Gastric emptying studies. For these studies, you’ll eat or drink something that contains a small, safe amount of radioactive material. A scanner can pick up signals from the radioactive material. This scanner tracks how long it takes your stomach to empty. Your breath may be tested for the radioactive material to measure how fast your stomach is emptying.
• Gastrointestinal (GI) monitoring capsule. For this test, you swallow a small capsule (or pill) that collects information as it moves through your digestive system. The pill sends this information to a small computer you wear around your waist or neck. After a few days, you will pass the capsule in your stool, and your doctor will study the information it collected.","Change your eating habits. Changing your eating habits can help control gastroparesis. However, make sure you get the proper nutrition and liquids.

Your doctor may recommend that you:

• Eat foods low in fat and fiber.
• Eat several small, healthy meals a day instead of two or three big meals.
• Chew your food completely.
• Eat soft, well-cooked foods.
• Avoid carbonated beverages.
• Avoid alcohol.
• Drink plenty of water or liquids (including low fat broths and clear soups, naturally sweetened fruit and vegetable juices, sports drinks, and oral rehydration products).
• Get some gentle physical activity after a meal, such as taking a walk.
• Avoid lying down for 2 hours after a meal.
• Take a daily multivitamin.

If your symptoms are moderate to severe, your doctor may recommend drinking only liquids. He or she may recommend eating well-cooked foods that have been chopped into small bites or processed in a blender.

Controlling blood glucose levels. If you have gastroparesis and diabetes, you will need to control your blood glucose levels. This includes hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar levels, can delay the emptying of food from your stomach. Your doctor will work with you to keep your blood glucose levels stable.","There is no cure for gastroparesis. Treatment will focus on treating any underlying problem that is causing it and controlling your symptoms. For example, your doctor may ask you to stop taking any drugs that can affect the digestive system. Don’t stop any medicine without first talking to your doctor. Your doctor also may want to treat any eating disorders, infections or other issues that could be causing gastroparesis. Your doctor might also recommend one or more of the following:

Dietary changes. Since you might not be able to eat normally, it’s important to get enough nutrients. You may need to:

• Eat several smaller meals each day instead of 2 or 3 large ones.
• Eat softer foods, such as vegetables or pasta that are cooked thoroughly.
• Limit fat (which can slow digestion) and fiber (which can be hard to digest).
• Supplement your diet with nutrition drinks (such as Ensure or Boost). You may need to eat solid food you can puree in a blender.

Medicine. Anti-nausea medicines called antiemetics can help with nausea and vomiting. Other medicines, such as metoclopramide and erythromycin, can stimulate stomach muscle contractions. Each of these drugs has some drawbacks, including potentially serious side effects. You and your doctor need to discuss whether the benefits of taking these medicines outweigh the risks.

Feeding tube. If your gastroparesis is severe, you may need a feeding tube. This tube will be inserted through your skin into your small intestine. Or it may be passed into your intestines through your nose or mouth. The tube allows nutrients to be delivered directly to your small intestine where digestion and absorption of nutrients can occur. A feeding tube can also help when gastroparesis causes unstable blood sugar levels in people who have diabetes.","Gastroparesis can result in complications, including:

• Weight loss, malnutrition, and dehydration. If you’re not able to eat enough food, or if you vomit what you eat, you may not be getting enough nutrition. Following the suggestions listed above may help with this problem.
• Bezoars. A bezoar is a solid mass of food that your stomach is not able to digest. Bezoars can cause nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, they may block other food from entering the small intestine. This situation can be life-threatening, and the bezoar may have to be surgically removed.
• Bacterial infections. When food stays in your stomach for too long, bacteria can grow out of control. This can lead to infection.
• Problems controlling blood sugar. When you have gastroparesis, your timing for digesting food doesn’t follow normal patterns. For this reason, people who have diabetes and gastroparesis often have a lot of trouble controlling their blood sugar levels.","• I have diabetes. Am I at risk of gastroparesis?
• How can I prevent gastroparesis?
• When should I see my doctor if I think I have gastroparesis?
• Are there lifestyle changes I can make that will ease or prevent gastroparesis?
• Is gastroparesis fatal?","American Family Physician: Gastrointestinal Complications of Diabetes

157,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://familydoctor.org/condition/generalized-anxiety-disorder/,"Anxiety is a word that describes feelings of apprehension, concern, nervousness, restlessness, or worry. Normal feelings of anxiety often serve as an “alarm system” that alerts you to danger. Your heart may beat fast. Your palms may get sweaty. Anxiety can provide an extra spark to help you get out of danger. It also can give you the energy to get things done in normal, busy situations. These occasional worries are normal.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is ongoing anxiety that isn’t related to a particular event or situation. It also can be anxiety that isn’t “normal” about a situation. For instance, a person who has GAD may constantly worry about something that’s unlikely to happen. These worries interfere with your day-to-day life.

Women are more likely to have GAD than men. GAD usually begins to affect people in their teens and early 20s.","GAD usually has a gradual onset, so you may not recognize the symptoms as they build up. GAD may fluctuate or change over time. If you have GAD, you may feel tense and worried more days than not. Other symptoms include:

• Trouble falling or staying asleep
• Muscle tension
• Irritability
• Trouble concentrating
• Getting tired easily
• Restlessness, feeling “keyed up” or on edge
• Irritability
• Shortness of breath
• Fast heartbeat
• Dry mouth
• Dizziness
• Stomach upset (such as diarrhea)
• Headaches, pains for no obvious reason

If you feel tense most of the time and have some or all of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. They will ask questions to make sure something else isn’t causing your symptoms. They also will perform a physical exam.","Suppose the fire alarm goes off in your home. You race around frantically to find the fire. Instead, you find there is no fire. The alarm just isn’t working properly.

It’s the same with anxiety disorders. Your body mistakenly triggers your alarm system when there is no danger. Most of us have some stresses in life or things that cause us to feel stressed. But those with GAD have the “alarm” going off frequently or all the time, even if they cannot identify a trigger. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in your body. It may also be related to:

• An unconscious memory
• A side effect of a medicine
• An illness

You also could have symptoms if your thyroid gland is too active. Depression can also cause them. GAD sometimes runs in families.","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and health history. They will perform a physical exam to make sure a physical or medical condition isn’t causing your symptoms. If your doctor doesn’t find any other reason for your symptoms, you may need to be treated for GAD.",There is no specific cause for GAD. This means it often can’t be prevented or avoided. The best thing to do is to address the symptoms as soon as possible. Then you can get started on a treatment plan and live a normal day-to-day life.,"People who have GAD must learn ways to cope with anxiety and worry. Your doctor can help you form a plan and develop skills to do so. The plan may include counseling, medicine, or both. Counseling can help you figure out what’s making you so tense. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to help you feel less anxious. Your doctor will recommend the treatment that’s right for you.","People who have GAD can get better. If you take medicine for it, you may not have to take it forever. Your doctor will tell you if it’s OK to stop taking your medicine.

The most important things are to talk about it, seek help, and take action. Action can help you gain a sense of control. The following are some tips on coping with anxiety:

• Control your worry. Choose a time and place to worry. Make it the same time and place every day. Spend 30 minutes thinking about your concerns and what you can do about them. Don’t dwell on what “might” happen. Focus more on what’s really happening. Then let go of the worry and go on with your day.
• Learn ways to relax. These may include activities such as yoga or a walk around the block.
• Breathe deeply. Follow these steps to take a break during your day to just breathe: Lie down on a flat surface. Place one hand on your stomach, just above your navel. Place the other hand on your chest. Breathe in slowly and try to make your stomach rise a little. Hold your breath for a second. Breathe out slowly and let your stomach go back down.
• Relax your muscles. Start by choosing a muscle and holding it tight for a few seconds. Then relax the muscle. Do this with all of your muscles, one part of your body at a time. Try starting with your feet muscles and working your way up your body.
• Exercise regularly. People who have anxiety often quit exercising. But exercise can give you a sense of well-being and help decrease feelings of anxiety.
• Get plenty of sleep. Sleep rests your brain as well as your body. It can improve your sense of well-being and your mood.
• Avoid alcohol abuse and drug abuse. It may seem that alcohol or drugs relax you. But in the long run, they make anxiety worse and cause more problems.
• Cut down on caffeine. Caffeine is found in chocolate, coffee, soft drinks, and tea. Caffeine may increase your sense of anxiety because it stimulates your nervous system. Also avoid over-the-counter diet pills and cough and cold medicines that contain a decongestant.
• Confront the things that have made you anxious in the past. Begin by just picturing yourself confronting these things. You can get used to the idea of confronting them before you actually do it.
• Use medicine if it helps.Your doctor may give you medicine to help reduce your anxiety while you learn ways to respond to it. Many types of medicine are available. Your doctor will decide which medicine is right for you.","• How do I know what’s causing my anxiety?
• How can I stop worrying about everything?
• What treatment is best for me?
• Will I have to take medicine for the rest of my life?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I should make?
• Should I change anything in my diet?
• What kind of exercise will help me?
• Do I have depression, too?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Generalized Anxiety Disorder – Self Care

158,Genital Warts,https://familydoctor.org/condition/genital-warts/,"Genital warts are small, flat, flesh-colored bumps or tiny, cauliflower-like bumps.

Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many kinds of HPV. Not all of them cause genital warts. HPV is associated with cancer of the vulva, anus, and penis. However, it’s important to note that HPV infection doesn’t always lead to cancer, and that genital warts are not cancer.","The symptoms of genital warts are the actual warts themselves. In men, genital warts can grow on the penis, near the anus, or between the penis and the scrotum. In women, genital warts may grow on the vulva and perineal area, in the vagina, and on the cervix (the opening to the uterus or womb). Genital warts vary in size and may even be so small that you can’t see them.","HPV causes genital warts. HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The most common way to get HPV is by having oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who is infected with HPV.

Just because you can’t see warts on your partner doesn’t mean they don’t have HPV. The infection can have a long incubation period. This means that months can pass between the time a person is infected with the virus and the time a person notices genital warts. Sometimes, the warts can take years to develop. In women, the warts may be where you can’t see them, such as inside the body on the surface of the cervix.","If you notice warts in your genital area, see your doctor. Your doctor may be able to diagnose the warts just by examining you. For women, a Pap test can help detect changes on the cervix that are caused by genital warts.","The only sure way to prevent genital warts is to not have sex. If you are sexually active, having sex only with a partner who isn’t infected with HPV and who only has sex with you will lower your risk of getting genital warts.

Using a condom may help prevent you from getting HPV, but condoms are not 100% effective. They do not cover all the affected skin.","Genital warts must be treated by your doctor. Do not try to treat the warts yourself.

The warts can be removed, but the viral infection itself can’t be cured. The virus lives inside your skin. This is why the warts often return after they have been removed. You may need to have them removed more than once.","If you have genital warts, talk to your doctor. It is important they treat your warts. Genital warts can grow if you do not get them treated. If you are sexually active, you also risk infecting your partner.

Certain kinds of HPV can cause abnormal cells to grow on the cervix. Sometimes, these cells can become cancerous if left untreated. Other kinds of HPV can cause cancer of the vulva, vagina, anus, or penis.","• What treatment is best for me?
• Is there any way I can keep my boyfriend/girlfriend from getting genital warts?
• Is there a special hygiene plan I need to follow while I’m being treated?
• Will my genital warts come back?
• Will my infection cause any future problems?
• How long will my treatment last?
• How often will I need to see my doctor?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Genital Warts

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","There are two types of HPV vaccine. Both types help protect against the HPV strains that are most likely to cause cervical cancer. One type also helps protect against the HPV strains that are most likely to cause genital warts.

Routine HPV vaccination is recommended for the following groups of people:

• Boys and girls ages 11 to 21
• Women ages 22 to 26
• Men ages 22 to 26 years of age who have a compromised immune system
• Gay and bisexual men

In certain circumstances, your doctor may recommend you receive the vaccination up to age 45.

The vaccines are given as shots (injections in the upper arm) and require 2-3 doses, depending on your age. The vaccine is most effective if children receive it before they start having sex.

One way to remove the warts is to freeze them. This is called cryotherapy. The warts can also be taken off with a laser.

A treatment called the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) can be used to remove the warts. With this method of removal, a sharp instrument shaped like a loop is passed underneath the wart and the wart is cut out of the skin.

Special chemicals can be used to remove the warts. These chemicals dissolve warts in the genital area. You may need to apply them to the area a number of times over a period of several weeks before the treatment is complete.

Chemicals you can buy at the store to remove warts from your hands should not be used for genital warts. They can make your genital skin very sore."
159,Gestational Diabetes,https://familydoctor.org/condition/gestational-diabetes/,"Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that starts during pregnancy. If you have diabetes, your body can’t use the sugar (glucose) in your blood as well as it should. This causes the level of sugar in your blood to become higher than normal.

Gestational diabetes affects 1% to 3% of all pregnant women. It usually develops in the second trimester (sometimes as early as the 20th week of pregnancy). Most often, gestational diabetes goes away after the baby is born.","Many times, there are no noticeable symptoms for women who have gestational diabetes. This could be because some of the common symptoms of diabetes are also symptoms of pregnancy. These include:

• Frequent urination
• Fatigue (being tired)
• Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach)

• Unusual amount of thirst
• Blurred vision
• Bladder infections","Pregnant women sometimes develop gestational diabetes because of pregnancy hormones. These hormones interfere with insulin. They can make your body more resistant to insulin. When this happens, insulin cannot regulate the sugar (glucose) in your blood. This makes your sugar levels increase.",null,"Gestational diabetes cannot always be prevented or avoided. According to the National Institutes of Health, you may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes if you:

• Are older than 25 while you are pregnant
• Come from a higher-risk ethnic group, such as Latin American, Black, Native American, Southeast Asian, or Pacific Islander
• Have a family history of diabetes
• Gave birth to a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds or had a birth defect
• Have high blood pressure
• Have too much amniotic fluid
• Have had an unexplained miscarriage or stillbirth
• Were overweight before your pregnancy
• Gain too much weight during your pregnancy
• Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

There are things you can do to reduce your chances for developing gestational diabetes:

• If you are overweight, try losing weight before you become pregnant. (Do not try to lose weight if you are already pregnant.)
• Do not use pregnancy as an excuse to eat sugary foods, such as cakes, candy, and ice cream.
• Talk to your doctor about safe exercises you can do while pregnant. Getting even a little exercise each day can do a lot to prevent diabetes.","If you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, lifestyle changes can help you control it. You will need to follow a diet suggested by your doctor, exercise regularly, and have frequent blood tests to check your blood sugar level.

Doing these things may not be enough to keep your blood sugar at a normal level. You may also need to take a medicine to help. There are several oral medications that can help control diabetes. Your doctor may prescribe one of these. Or you may need to take insulin injections to lower your blood sugar.

Your doctor may ask you to see a specialist if you have to start taking insulin.

What changes should I make in my diet?

Your doctor may ask you to change some of the foods you eat and see a registered dietitian to help you plan your meals. It’s important to eat well-balanced meals. You may need to eat less at each meal, depending on how much weight you gain during your pregnancy. Your doctor or dietitian will talk to you about this.

Avoid eating foods that contain a lot of simple sugar, such as cake, cookies, candy, or ice cream. Instead, eat foods that contain natural sugars, such as fruits. But cut down on drinking fruit juices, which have a high concentration of sugar. Also, avoid drinking soda or other sugary drinks.

If you get hungry between meals, eat foods that are healthy for you, such as raisins, carrot sticks, or a piece of fruit. Whole-grain pasta, whole-grain breads, and rice are also good for both you and your baby.

Your doctor will suggest that you exercise regularly at a level that is safe for you and the baby. Exercise will help keep your blood sugar level normal. It can also make you feel better. Walking is usually the easiest type of exercise when you are pregnant. But swimming or other exercises you enjoy are also beneficial during this time. Ask your doctor to recommend some activities that would be safe for you.

If you’re not used to exercising, begin by exercising for 5 or 10 minutes every day. As you get stronger, you can increase your exercise time to 30 minutes or more per session. The longer you exercise and the more often you exercise, the more in control you will be of your blood sugar.

You do need to be careful about how you exercise. Don’t exercise too hard or get too hot while exercising. Ask your doctor what activities are safe for you. Depending on your age, your pulse shouldn’t go higher than 140 to 160 beats per minute during exercise. If you become dizzy or have pain while exercising, stop exercising immediately and call your doctor. If you have uterine contractions (labor pains), vaginal bleeding, or your water breaks, call your doctor right away.

What happens after my baby is born?

You may not need to have blood tests to check your blood sugar while you’re in the hospital after your baby is born. However, it may be several weeks after your baby’s birth before your gestational diabetes goes away. To make sure it has gone away, your doctor will ask you to have a special blood test 1 or 2 months after you have your baby.","Gestational diabetes increases your risk for diabetes in your next pregnancy and later in life. It is important that you continue to exercise, watch your weight, and eat a healthy diet after pregnancy. If you do these things, you may avoid diabetes when you’re older.","• I’m pregnant. Am I at risk for gestational diabetes?
• Is screening for gestational diabetes a standard part of my prenatal care?
• What tests do I need?
• Does gestational diabetes put my baby at risk for any health problems?
• Can I control gestational diabetes through lifestyle changes alone?

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","High blood sugar levels can be unhealthy for both you and your baby. If the diabetes isn’t treated, your baby may be more likely to have problems at birth. For example, your baby may have a low blood sugar level or jaundice. Or your baby may weigh much more than normal.

Gestational diabetes can also affect your health. For instance, if your baby is very large, you may have a more difficult delivery. You may even need a cesarean section. Gestational diabetes also increases your risk of developing preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition that can be serious if left untreated.

As part of your prenatal care, your doctor will recommend screening for gestational diabetes around 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. This could happen sooner if there is reason to believe you are at risk for developing gestational diabetes. If you have elevated glucose levels in your urine or other risks, your doctor may recommend having the screening sooner.

During the glucose test, you’ll drink a syrupy-sweet bottle of glucose solution. One hour after drinking that, a lab technician will take a sample of your blood. He or she will measure the amount of sugar in your blood.

If your blood sugar is too high, your doctor will likely prescribe another glucose test. For this test, you will need to fast (not eat for 8-14 hours before the test). A lab technician will test your blood sugar while you are fasting. Then, you will again drink the glucose solution. The lab technician will test your blood once an hour for 3 hours."
160,Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica,https://familydoctor.org/condition/giant-cell-arteritis-and-polymyalgia-rheumatica/,"This condition causes inflammation of the arteries in the arms, upper body, and neck. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Arteritis is a condition in which the arteries become inflamed (swollen). This reduces blood flow. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) causes certain arteries to become inflamed, red, hot, or painful. It usually affects the arteries above and in front of the ears on both sides of the head (the temples). This type of GCA is also sometimes called temporal arteritis or cranial arteritis.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a condition involving inflammation of the muscles in your neck, shoulders, hips, and thighs. This causes stiffness and aching in these areas. It usually develops over time. But for some people, it can start as quickly as overnight. With treatment, PMR usually goes away within a year. It can last for several years in some cases. Both disorders mainly affect people over 50, particularly women.","• Flu-like symptoms. These can include fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite.
• Severe headaches.
• Pain and tenderness in one or both temples.
• Jaw pain, especially when chewing.
• Double vision or vision loss.
• Dizziness.
• Pain and stiffness in the neck and arms.
• Unintended weight loss.

• Aching pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, hips, and thighs.
• Fatigue.
• General muscle weakness.
• Unintended weight loss.

Eating a healthy diet and getting enough exercise can help relieve the symptoms of both GCA and PMR.","Doctors aren’t sure what causes the inflammation associated with GCA or PMR. Aging and problems with the immune system are possible factors. It also could be related to your genes, or to an environmental trigger like an infection.","To diagnose GCA, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine the arteries in your temple. He or she will check if they are swollen or tender. They may order blood tests to check for inflammation of the arteries and to rule out other conditions. Often, a biopsy of the temporal artery is needed to confirm the diagnosis. This is an outpatient procedure that involves removing a sample of your temporal artery from your scalp area.

To diagnose PMR, your doctor will likely perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. He or she may order a blood test. This can help detect inflammation of your arteries and check your blood count. Your doctor could also order a muscle biopsy (removing a small sample of muscle) to check for PMR.

Your doctor also can order a c-reactive protein test. This blood test measures the amount of inflammation in your bloodstream but doesn’t identify where the inflammation is located.",There is no known way to prevent GCA or PMR because doctors aren’t sure what causes them.,"Your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid medicine to treat inflammation and pain. This can help with symptoms of GCA and PMR. These medicines are taken by mouth (in pill form). Once you start taking a corticosteroid, you should feel better quickly. You may need to take this medicine for 6 months up to 2 years.","Taking a corticosteroid for a long time can raise your blood pressure. It can also increase your blood sugar levels or weaken your bones. Your doctor will need to keep checking you for these side effects during your treatment. Corticosteroids can cause other side effects. These include jitteriness, poor sleep, and weight gain. These symptoms usually get better as you take smaller doses of the medicine.

Getting early treatment for GCA is important. If inflamed arteries aren’t treated right away, they could be permanently damaged. This increases your risk of blindness or stroke. But with proper treatment, GCA and PMR may come back. About half of the time, though, a person who has PMR will experience at least 1 relapse.","• What is the likely cause of my symptoms?
• Do I need any blood tests or biopsies?

You are more likely to develop GCA and PMR if you are older than 50 years of age. The conditions are most common in women between 70 and 80 years of age. For unknown reasons, Caucasian people are more likely to develop GCA and PMR than people of other races."
161,Giardiasis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/giardiasis/,"Giardiasis is an infection you can get in your small intestine. It is caused by a microscopic parasite called Giardia lamblia. Once you have been infected with the parasite, it lives in your intestines. It is passed along through feces (poop). Anything that comes in contact with feces from an infected person or animal can become contaminated. Giardiasis is one of the main causes of diarrhea in the United States. It can be found all around the world.","Diarrhea is the main symptom of giardiasis. Other symptoms include:

• Bloating
• Intestinal gas
• Abdominal cramps
• Nausea
• Loss of appetite
• Low-grade fever
• Weight loss and loss of body fluids

Symptoms usually appear 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the parasite. Although these problems can be very unpleasant, the illness isn’t usually dangerous.","The Giardia parasite lives all over the world in soil, food, and water. It also can live on surfaces that have come into contact with human or animal waste. You could be infected if:

• You drink untreated water in nature. Many animals carry giardia in their feces. They may introduce the parasite into rivers, streams, or lakes. Infected stream water may look clean and safe when it really isn’t.
• Your city water became infected through sewer line flooding or leaking.
• You travel to a place that doesn’t boil or treat their water.
• You swallow water while swimming or playing in a lake, river, or stream.
• You are exposed to another person who has giardiasis.
• You eat raw or undercooked food that is contaminated with the parasite.
• You have unprotected anal sex with a person with the parasite.

Some people who get giardiasis don’t become ill. But they can still spread the parasite to other people. Giardiasis may be easily spread in daycare centers or nursing homes. It is important that workers wash their hands each time after changing diapers or helping someone go to the bathroom.","To diagnose giardiasis, your doctor will want to you to provide stool (poop) samples to the lab. The lab will look at the samples under a microscope. Several samples may have to be checked before the diagnosis can be made. Sometimes other tests may be necessary.","Giardiasis can be prevented in many cases. The best ways to avoid it are:

• Be very careful about the water you drink. Don’t drink water from rivers, lakes, or streams.
• When camping, take bottled water or boil water before you use it.
• Wash your hands carefully with soap and water several times a day.
• When traveling, don’t brush your teeth or wash dishes with water that hasn’t been boiled.
• Peel raw fruits and vegetables before you eat them.
• Don’t eat undercooked food.

If one person in your family gets giardiasis, it’s likely that everyone in your home will get it, especially children. Hand washing is very important to help prevent the illness from spreading.","If your symptoms are mild, you generally won’t need treatment for giardiasis. Mild infections can go away on their own in a few weeks. If symptoms are severe or aren’t going away, medicine can be used. Infected people who work at a daycare or nursing home may also be treated with medicine. This can help prevent the illness from spreading.

There are many medicines that can be used to treat giardiasis. One of the most common is called metronidazole. It’s usually taken 3 times a day for 5 to 10 days. Side effects may include a metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, and a severe reaction to alcohol. It is safest for pregnant women to avoid this treatment. Children younger than 5 years of age may be treated with furazolidone. This medicine has fewer side effects and comes in a liquid form.

Giardiasis spreads very easily. It’s usually best if a whole family is treated at the same time. In most cases, your doctor will want to check a stool sample after the treatment to be sure the medicine worked. Sometimes you may need to take medicine for a longer time. Or your doctor may want you to take another medicine for a complete cure.

It is important to treat for dehydration when you have giardiasis. Pregnant women and infants are more likely to get dehydrated when they have diarrhea. Dehydration can be fatal for infants. Talk to your doctor about treatment options if your baby has giardiasis.","Call your doctor if you have diarrhea, bloating, and nausea for more than a week. Giardiasis is unpleasant, but it’s not usually dangerous. Once you begin the medicine, you can recover in about a week. If it’s left untreated, symptoms can last 6 weeks or more.

As with any illness, complications can occur. These include:

• Dehydration – losing too much water and other fluids in your body.
• Malabsorption – when the intestinal tract doesn’t absorb enough nutrients from your food.
• Weight loss – excessive diarrhea can cause you to lose too much weight too fast.

Call your doctor if you’ve been treated for giardiasis but are experiencing any of these symptoms.","• My family is going camping. How can we prevent giardiasis?
• What should I do if I think I have giardiasis?
• Do water filters prevent giardiasis?
• Are there medicines that prevent giardiasis? Is there a vaccine for giardiasis?
• What medicines treat giardiasis? Are there side effects?
• My water comes from a well. Should I have my well water tested?
• Can I get giardiasis from my pet?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Giardiasis

It usually happens when fluid builds up in the eye, causing an increase in pressure. This damages the eye’s optic nerve.","At first, glaucoma has no symptoms. It causes no pain and your vision is normal. Eventually, without treatment, you will start losing your peripheral (side) vision. You might miss seeing objects out of the corner of your eye. Over time, it will seem like you’re looking through a tunnel. If your glaucoma is left untreated, your vision may gradually decrease until it is completely gone.

Many people who have glaucoma aren’t aware they have the disease. By the time they notice loss of vision, the eye damage is severe.

Rarely, an individual will have an acute (sudden or short-term) attack of glaucoma. In these cases, the eye becomes red and extremely painful. Nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision may also occur. This is an eye emergency. Call your eye doctor right away if you experience these symptoms.","Normally, fluid in your eye nourishes the eye and keeps it healthy. After the fluid circulates through the eye, it empties through a drain in the front of your eye. In people who have glaucoma, the fluid doesn’t drain properly. Instead, it builds up and causes increased pressure in the eye and damages the optic nerve.","Glaucoma is usually diagnosed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. These are people specially trained to provide care for eyes. They will give you a complete eye exam, including tests that can diagnose glaucoma. The tests include:

• Visual acuity test: This measures how well you see at different distances.
• Visual field test: This measures your peripheral vision.
• Dilated eye exam: This allows your eye doctor to examine your retina and optic nerve for signs of damage or other eye problems.
• Tonometry: This measures the pressure inside the eye.
• Pachymetry: This measures the thickness of your cornea (the outer layer of your eye).","Some people are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma. They include people who:

• Are 40 years of age or older
• Have a family history of glaucoma
• Have high pressure in the eyes
• Have diabetes
• Have hypertension
• Have heart disease
• Have near-sightedness (it is difficult for you to see objects in the distance)

There’s nothing you can do to avoid getting glaucoma. But you can prevent it from having a big impact on your vision. The best way to do this is by getting an eye exam regularly by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. People 18 to 60 years of age should have an eye exam every 2 years. After age 60, you should have an eye exam once a year.

If you have diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease, follow your doctor’s instructions for managing and controlling those conditions to reduce your risk of glaucoma.

Early diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma can prevent damage to the eye’s nerve cells and prevent severe vision loss.","There are several treatment options for glaucoma. The first treatment option usually is either medicated eye drops or pills. These aim to lower the pressure in your eye, prevent further nerve damage, and stop vision loss. This treatment works for many people. Keep in mind it may be hard to remember to take your medicine. That’s because glaucoma often doesn’t cause symptoms. But it’s important to take it as your doctor prescribed.

If the eye drops or pills don’t help relieve the pressure in your eye, your doctor may suggest laser treatment. During this procedure, a laser is used to open the drain where fluid flows out of your eye. It’s a painless procedure. If that procedure doesn’t work, you may need surgery to create a new channel where fluid can flow out of your eye. Talk with your doctor about the best option for you.","If your glaucoma is caught and treated early, you might not notice any difference in your vision. You can lead a normal life with no symptoms, as long as you take your medicine every day. Your eye doctor will likely want to see you every 3 to 6 months for a check-up.

If you have lost some of your vision, talk to your eye doctor. They may be able to suggest some services or devices that can help you make the most of your remaining vision. Also, community agencies may offer counseling, training, or other special services for people who have impaired vision.","• What is the right treatment for me?
• Will I have to continue my treatment for the rest of my life?
• Does this treatment have any side effects?
• Is surgery an option for me? Will I need to use eye drops after surgery?
• Should I continue to drive?

163,Gout,https://familydoctor.org/condition/gout/,"Gout is a common type of arthritis. It is marked by swelling and pain in your joints. It most often occurs in one or both of your big toes. It can affect your feet, ankles, fingers, wrists, elbows, and knees as well. Men develop gout more often than women. Women are more likely to develop gout after menopause. The condition can be acute (short-lasting) or chronic (long-lasting). It can be extremely painful.","The symptoms of gout may be sudden and often start at night. The affected joint swells and becomes red, hot, and painful. The joint may become stiff and hurt more when you touch it. An acute attack lasts 3 to 10 days on average, and nearly all resolve within 2 weeks. Chronic cases occur more often but may be less severe.","Too much uric acid in your body causes gout. Uric acid forms naturally when your body breaks down purines. Purines also are found in some foods we eat. Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine. In people who have gout, uric acid builds up and forms sharp crystals in the joint space. Gout is genetic and can run in families. Stress, poor diet, alcohol use, and other health problems, such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, and hypertension can trigger the attack.","Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms and health history. Tell them if gout runs in your family. Your doctor may detect the condition by looking at your joints. To confirm a diagnosis, they can take a sample of the fluid from your joint and look for uric acid crystals. A blood test can check for elevated uric acid in your blood but doesn’t always confirm if you currently have a gout attack.","There are several ways you can help lower your risk of gout and prevent future attacks.

• Limit or avoid foods that are rich in purines. These include salmon, sardines, herring, organ meats, red meats, asparagus, and mushrooms.
• Try to eat foods that are low in sugar, salt and fat.
• Lose weight if you’re overweight.
• Avoid alcohol or limit the amount of alcohol you drink.
• Drink lots of water to help flush uric acid from your body.

Certain health conditions can increase your chance of gout. Get treatment if you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Medicines that may cause gout include:

• Diuretics (“water pills”) used to treat high blood pressure
• Niacin (a B-complex vitamin)
• Aspirin (taken in low doses)
• Cyclosporine (used to prevent the body from rejecting a new organ after transplant surgery)
• Some drugs used to treat cancer
• Pyrazinamide and ethambutol (used to treat tuberculosis)","The sooner you start treatment, the sooner your pain will go away. There are several things you can do to treat symptoms.

• Limit the amount of animal protein you eat.
• Avoid alcohol completely.
• Drink extra water to flush your body of uric acid.
• Limit use of your affected joint and rest in bed.
• Keep clothes and bedding off the joint to avoid irritation.
• Elevate your joint to help reduce swelling.
• Take medicine to reduce swelling and relieve pain. Over-the-counter medicines include ibuprofen (one brand name: Advil) and naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). Your doctor also can prescribe medicine for you. Examples include corticosteroids, like prednisone, or colchicine.
• Talk to your doctor about prescription medicine, such as allopurinol, febuxostat, and pegloticase.","With the proper treatment, your gout attack should go away in a few days. If left untreated, it can last for several days or up to 2 weeks.

Talk to your doctor if you continue to have attacks. The more frequent they are, the longer they can last and the more joints it can affect. Your doctor can prescribe medicines to help prevent future attacks. These medicines wash the uric acid from your joints, lower the level in your body, and reduce swelling. Aspirin can interfere with the way these medicines work. Work with your doctor on a treatment plan to manage the condition. You may need routine visits to check your uric acid level.

Over time, gout attacks can lead to tophi. These are uric acid crystals that form lumps on your joints under your skin. Tophi can form on your toes, fingers, hands, and elbows. They cause chronic pain and can destroy the bones around your joints. You also may develop kidney stones or kidney disease from uric acid crystals that collect in your urinary tract.","• Why do some people get gout and others don’t?
• If I have a gout attack once, will I always have gout?
• What medicine can I take to prevent future attacks?
• If I have gout, am I at risk of other types of arthritis?
• Am I at risk of long-term joint damage?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Gout National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Gout National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases: Gout

164,Group B Strep Infection,https://familydoctor.org/condition/group-b-strep-infection/,"Group B streptococcus, or group B strep for short, is a common kind of bacteria (germ). It can live in the intestine, the rectum, or a woman’s vagina. Group B strep doesn’t usually cause problems in healthy adults. Most of the people who get sick from group B strep are newborns who are exposed to the bacteria during birth.

About 25% of healthy pregnant women have group B strep in their bodies. A woman who has group B strep is said to be “colonized” with this germ. If you are colonized with group B strep, your baby can become infected with these germs while being born and can get sick. There is less than a 1% chance that this will happen. But because group B strep infection is so dangerous for babies, it’s important to find out if you’re colonized while you’re pregnant.","Group B strep doesn’t usually cause symptoms in healthy adults.

Babies who have group B strep may develop symptoms during their first week of life. This is called early-onset disease. Or they may develop symptoms from 1 week to 3 months of life. This is called late-onset disease.

The symptoms of group B strep infection in newborns may include:

• Fever
• Difficulty feeding
• Lethargy (the baby is tired, hard to wake up, limp, or inactive)
• Difficulty breathing (with severe breathing problems, the baby’s skin, lips, or nails may turn blue)

If you notice these symptoms in your newborn, call your doctor right away.","The group B strep bacteria come and go naturally in people’s bodies. If a pregnant woman has the bacteria in her body, she can pass it to her baby during labor and delivery. A group B strep infection happens when a baby is exposed to the bacteria while it’s being born. The bacteria can cause the baby to get sick. The most common illnesses caused by the bacteria in newborns are:

• Pneumonia (infection in the lungs)
• Meningitis (infection of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord)
• Bacteremia or sepsis (infection in the blood)

There are some factors that increase a pregnant woman’s risk of having a baby who develops group B strep disease. These include:

• Testing positive for the bacteria late in pregnancy (35-37 weeks)
• Having the bacteria found in your urine anytime during your pregnancy
• Having the baby early (before 37 weeks)
• Developing a fever during labor
• Going a long time between when your water breaks and when you deliver (18 hours or more)
• Having had a baby before who developed group B strep disease","If you’re pregnant, your doctor can do a test to see if you are “group B strep positive.” This test usually is done when you are 35 to 37 weeks pregnant. To perform the test, your doctor will swab your vagina and your rectum and will send the swabs to a lab to see if the strep bacteria grow.

If you have group B strep, it’s important to understand that you aren’t sick. Also, you probably will not make your baby sick. Knowing that you carry the bacteria just helps you and your doctor make decisions that can protect your baby from infection.","Pregnant women can’t avoid having group B strep in their bodies. But passing it along to their babies is preventable. The two ways to prevent your baby from getting an early-onset group B strep infection is to:

• Get tested for the bacteria late in pregnancy (35-37 weeks).
• Get antibiotics during labor and delivery if you are at increased risk. This includes women who tested positive for the bacteria.

Currently there is not a way to prevent your baby from getting late-onset group B strep disease.","If you test positive for group B strep or are at increased risk of having it, your doctor will give you antibiotics during labor. These will be given intravenously (through an IV) to kill the germs. Because the bacteria grow quickly, the antibiotics are only effective if they are given during labor. Penicillin is the most common antibiotic that doctors prescribe to treat group B strep.

If you get antibiotics while you’re in labor, the chances are very good that your baby won’t get an early-onset group B strep infection.","In healthy adults, group B strep doesn’t usually cause any problems. Certain groups are more likely to have complications from group B strep:

• Infants who have group B strep can develop serious or life-threatening infections, such as meningitis, pneumonia, or sepsis.
• Some pregnant women who have group B strep may develop an infection of the urinary tract (also called a UTI), placenta, amniotic fluid, or bloodstream.
• Older adults and people who have a chronic illness or a weak immune system are more likely to develop problems due to group B strep infection. These problems may include infections of the skin, bloodstream, urinary tract, lungs, bones and joints, heart valve (called endocarditis), or the fluid around the brain and spinal cord.","• Is testing for group B strep infection a standard part of my prenatal care?
• When should I schedule the test?
• What do my test results mean?
• If I have group B strep, how do we keep my baby from getting it too?
• Will I need antibiotics? Are they safe for the baby?
• Will I need a C-section, or can I still deliver my baby vaginally?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Group B Strep (GBS)

165,Growing Pains in Children,https://familydoctor.org/condition/growing-pains/,"Growing pains involve your child’s musculoskeletal system, meaning their muscles and bones. These pains usually make your child’s legs hurt. They are common in children between 3 and 12 years old and are typically not serious. Growing pains are not the same as a growth spurt.","Growing pain symptoms can include:

• Pain in your child’s shins (front of lower leg), calves (back of lower leg), thighs, or the area behind their knees
• Pain in those areas that happens late in the day or during the night but goes away by morning.

Growing pains vary from child to child. Sometimes growing pains last just a few minutes; other times they last a few hours. The pain may be mild, or it may be severe. Not all children have growing pains. However, if your child does have them, the pain may come and go with many days in between without pain. Children with severe cases may feel pain every day.","Doctors don’t know what causes growing pains. They do know that children who have growing pains may feel more pain after physical activity than other children feel. Also, some children who have growing pains may have weaker bones than their peers.","There is no test to diagnose growing pains. Instead, your doctor may ask you questions about when and where your child has pain. Your doctor may also ask what your child did the day the pain started. Did your child spend part of the day playing sports, running, or jumping? A lot of physical activity during the day may cause growing pains to happen that night. Your answers to these questions may help your doctor diagnose your child with growing pains.

Your doctor may order tests to make sure the pains aren’t being caused by something else.",There’s no known way to prevent or avoid growing pains.,"You may be able to help your child feel better when he or she has growing pains. Your doctor may suggest you do one or more of the following:

• Massage the painful area.
• Stretch the muscles in the painful area.
• Give your child a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (one brand: Tylenol) or an NSAID (one brand: Advil). Your doctor may suggest medicines be taken after the pain has started. Or, to avoid growing pains at night, your doctor may advise you to give your child medicine after a day with lots of physical activity. Daily medicines also may help if your child has growing pains every night.","Growing pains usually aren’t serious and are a common part of childhood for many children.

Growing pains may cause your child to be tired during the day. That’s because he or she may not sleep well when having the pains during the night. It’s important to know the techniques your doctor advises to help your child get back to sleep as soon as possible.","• Why is my child having growing pains?

166,Gynecomastia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/gynecomastia/,"Gynecomastia is a condition in which men have enlarged breasts. It is caused by an increase in breast tissue, not fat tissue. Gynecomastia may be present in one or both breasts.

Both boys and men can have the condition. It can occur in newborns as well. Some men or boys have excess fat that looks like breasts. This is known as pseudogynecomastia. It is a similar, but different condition than gynecomastia.","The main symptom of gynecomastia is enlarged breasts. Your breasts may be tender, as well. You may feel a slight bump or lump behind the nipple.","The main cause of gynecomastia is a change in hormones. Most often, this happens at birth, puberty, or as part of aging. These are natural times when the hormones in your body change levels. An imbalance of hormones—estrogen and testosterone—can enlarge your breasts.

Newborns who are born with enlarged breasts often have too much estrogen. Mothers transfer this hormone to their babies in the womb.

Gynecomastia is common in teenage boys. More than half of boys have some degree of the condition during puberty.

In adult men, the balance of hormones is affected by aging. Gynecomastia is more common in men who are 50 years of age or older. Other causes include health conditions, such as:

• Tumors of the adrenal gland, pituitary gland, or testes
• Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)
• Hypogonadism (low testosterone)
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease

It can also be caused by medicines, such as:

• HIV/AIDS medicines
• Chemotherapy and radiation
• Antibiotics
• Medicines for heart disease
• Anti-anxiety medicines
• Tricyclic antidepressants
• Ulcer and heartburn medicines, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

Another potential cause is drugs, such as:

• Opioids
• Anabolic steroids
• Amphetamines
• Heroin
• Marijuana

Gynecomastia can also be caused by other lifestyle factors including obesity, alcohol use, and the consumption of estrogen in medicines or in foods that contain soy.

It is very rare for breast cancer to be the cause of gynecomastia. Lumps caused by cancer do not form in breast tissue behind the nipple. The lumps also feel different than those caused by gynecomastia. Other signs of breast cancer are dimpling of the skin and bloody discharge from the nipple.","Make an appointment with your doctor if you have concerns. Your doctor may notice symptoms during a routine check-up. They may ask about your symptoms, such as how long you’ve had the tissue growth and if the area is tender. Your doctor also may ask about your health history and what medicines you take.

The doctor will decide if tests are needed to diagnose gynecomastia. The most common test is a blood test to check your hormone levels. More tests may be done if your doctor suspects a disease. These can include:

• An ultrasound
• Mammogram
• Breast biopsy","Most cases of gynecomastia cannot be prevented. They are caused by natural changes in hormone levels. Adults can help prevent gynecomastia by avoiding certain medicines, drugs, and lifestyle factors.","In most cases, treatment is not needed. Your doctor may want to check the size of your breast tissue every few months.

If treatment is needed, options vary based on the cause of the condition. Talk to your doctor before stopping any prescription medicine to treat other medical conditions. Stop taking illegal drugs. You may need to make lifestyle changes as well. If it caused by a disease or tumor, you will need to treat the problem. This may include medicine or surgery. Medicine can help to balance your hormones. In rare cases, the doctor may suggest plastic surgery to remove the extra breast tissue.","For most newborns and teenage boys, gynecomastia does not last long. The breasts go back to normal in 6 months to 2 years.

Ask the doctor about taking an over-the-counter pain medicine to relieve breast tenderness. Using a cold compress on the area can help as well.","• What is the likely cause of gynecomastia?
• How do I know if a certain medicine or drug is the cause?
• Do I have a health condition or disease that is causing enlarged breasts?
• Should I be tested for breast cancer?
• Will I need treatment?
• How long will it take for the breast growth to return to normal?

167,H1N1 Influenza,https://familydoctor.org/condition/h1n1-influenza/,H1N1 influenza is a viral infection. It’s not the same as seasonal flu (influenza). The first outbreak occurred in 2009 and infected people all over the world. It was called swine flu early on because tests showed it was like flu viruses that occur in swine (pigs).,"Symptoms start 3 to 5 days after exposure to the virus. On average, they last about 8 days. Common symptoms include:

• fever
• sore throat
• cough
• muscle aches
• headache
• chills
• fatigue
• runny or stuffy nose
• vomiting
• diarrhea

These symptoms are similar to those with any viral infection. However, call your doctor if your symptoms aren’t improving. H1N1 is a rare cause of these symptoms. Your doctor will tell you if you need an office visit to see if you have the virus.

Babies and children may have different symptoms.

• Trouble breathing.
• Fever combined with a rash.
• Confusion or impatience.
• Trouble waking up.
• Not drinking enough fluids.
• Flu-like symptoms that go away and then return with a fever and cough.

Call your doctor right away if your baby or child has any of these symptoms.","A virus causes H1N1. It spreads from person to person. You can’t get it by eating pork or pork products.

It spreads from person to person as droplets are released during coughing or sneezing. You can become infected either by inhaling (breathing in) the virus, or touching a surface contaminated by the virus and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.","Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. This alone may alert him or her that you have H1N1. Your doctor may do a rapid flu test, but this checks for several viruses. The test to only check for H1N1 takes a few days to get results. Your doctor may want to start treatment right away and not wait for results. This is common if there is an H1N1 outbreak in your area and lots of people are infected.","The best way to avoid H1N1 is to get the flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that anyone 6 months of age or older receive the flu vaccine. People who work in health care should get the vaccine. So should anyone who lives with or takes care of children younger than 6 months of age.

There are 2 types of the vaccine. The trivalent flu vaccine protects against the 3 most common strains of flu each season. The quadrivalent vaccine protects against 4 strains. The flu vaccine has protected against H1N1 since 2010. In general, it’s safe, but there is a chance you may have a reaction. Tell your doctor if you have an allergy to something in the vaccine or if you’ve had a reaction in the past. Sometimes there isn’t enough of a certain vaccine for the number of people who need it. This can cause a vaccine shortages.

You can prevent getting and spreading H1N1 by practicing good care.

• Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
• If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands.
• Put used tissues in the trash.
• Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
• Avoid people who are sick.
• Wear a mask if you’re traveling or around large groups of people.
• Don’t share personal items, such as makeup, utensils, or sports or office equipment.
• If you get sick, stay home from work or school. Avoid being around people. Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever breaks.","Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat H1N1. This helps kill the virus so you can recover and aren’t contagious. If you have a fever, you can take medicine to reduce it. This includes acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol), ibuprofen (brand names: Advil or Motrin), or naproxen (brand name: Aleve). These drugs also relieve aches and pains. Don’t give aspirin to children or teenagers 18 years of age or younger because of the risk of Reye’s syndrome. Reye’s syndrome is a serious illness that can lead to death. You also should drink fluids to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. Rest helps your body fight infection.

Your doctor may prescribe an anti-viral drug, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir. Anti-viral drugs decrease the flu virus’ ability to reproduce. They can shorten the time you’re sick, reduce your symptoms, and prevent problems caused by the flu. Anti-viral drugs work best if you start taking them when your symptoms begin. This form of treatment is more common if you’re at high risk of flu complications. This includes:

• Pregnant women.
• Children and young adults between 6 months and 24 years of age.
• Adults who are 65 years of age or older.
• People who have a severe illness or are in the hospital.
• People who have weak immune systems or chronic health problems, such as asthma or heart disease.",Most people can fight off and get rid of H1N1 on their own. You may need treatment or close medical care if your symptoms worsen or you’re at risk of having complications.,"• When and how often should I get the flu vaccine?
• How long do I need to take medicine to treat H1N1?
• Can I get H1N1 more than once?
• Can I spread H1N1 to others?

168,Hair Loss,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hair-loss/,"Hair growth typically completes a cycle in 2 to 3 years. Each hair grows approximately 1 centimeter per month during this phase. About 90% of the hair on your scalp is growing at any one time. About 10% of the hair on your scalp, at any one time, is in a resting phase. After 3 to 4 months, the resting hair falls out and new hair starts to grow in its place.

It is normal to shed some hair each day as part of this cycle. However, some people may experience excessive (more than normal) hair loss. Hair loss of this type can affect men, women, and children.

“Common baldness” usually means male-pattern baldness, or permanent-pattern baldness. The medical term for this is androgenetic alopecia. Male-pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss in men. Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Men who start losing their hair at an early age tend to develop more extensive baldness. In male-pattern baldness, hair loss typically results in a receding hairline and baldness on the top of the head.

Women may develop female-pattern baldness. In this form of hair loss, the hair can become thin over the entire scalp.","For most people, excessive hair loss is gradual, which means it happens over a long period of time. This is especially true of male-pattern baldness. Hair loss is considered excessive when it results in bald spots or hair that is noticeably thinning. In some cases, hair can fall out suddenly. This is typically caused by sudden or prolonged stress, either physical or emotional.","A number of things can cause excessive hair loss. For example, about 3 or 4 months after an illness or a major surgery, you may suddenly lose a large amount of hair. This hair loss is related to the stress of the illness and is temporary.

Hormonal problems may cause hair loss. If your thyroid gland is overactive or underactive, your hair may fall out. This hair loss usually can be helped by treating your thyroid disease. Hair loss may occur if male or female hormones, known as androgens and estrogens, are out of balance. Correcting the hormone imbalance may stop your hair loss.

Many women notice hair loss about 3 months after they’ve had a baby. This loss is also related to hormones. During pregnancy, high levels of certain hormones cause the body to keep hair that would normally fall out. When the hormones return to pre-pregnancy levels, that hair falls out and the normal cycle of growth and loss starts again.

Some medicines can cause hair loss. This type of hair loss improves when you stop taking the medicine. Medicines that can cause hair loss include blood thinners (also called anticoagulants); medicines used for gout, high blood pressure, or heart problems; vitamin A (if you take too much of it); birth control pills; and antidepressants.

Certain infections can cause hair loss. Fungal infections of the scalp can cause hair loss in adults and children. The infection is treated with antifungal medicines.

Finally, hair loss may occur as part of an underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. Since hair loss may be an early sign of a disease, it is important to find the cause so that it can be treated.

Yes. If you wear pigtails or cornrows or use tight hair rollers, the pull on your hair can cause a type of hair loss called traction alopecia. If the pulling is stopped before scarring of the scalp develops, your hair will grow back normally. However, scarring can cause permanent hair loss. Hot oil hair treatments or chemicals used in permanents (also called “perms”) may cause inflammation (swelling) of the hair follicle. This can result in scarring and hair loss.","If you suspect that you may have excessive hair loss, talk to your doctor. He or she will probably ask you some questions about your diet, any medicines you’re taking, and whether you’ve had a recent illness, and how you take care of your hair. If you’re a woman, your doctor may ask questions about your menstrual cycle, pregnancies, and menopause. Your doctor may want to do a physical exam to look for other causes of hair loss. Finally, your doctor may order blood tests or a biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope).","There is no way to prevent male-pattern baldness (or female-pattern baldness) because it is a genetic trait, meaning you inherited a gene for baldness from your parents.

Some other causes of excessive hair loss can be prevented. For example, you could prevent hair loss by not styling hair too tightly in a way that puts too much pressure on your scalp. You also can talk to your doctor and avoid taking medications that could cause hair loss.","Depending on your type of hair loss, treatments are available. If a medicine is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine. Recognizing and treating an infection may help stop the hair loss. Correcting a hormone imbalance may prevent further hair loss.

Medicines may also help slow or prevent the development of common baldness. One medicine, minoxidil (brand name: Rogaine), is available without a prescription. It is applied to the scalp. Both men and women can use it. Another medicine, finasteride, is available with a prescription. It comes in pills and is only for men. It may take up to 6 months before you can tell if one of these medicines is working.","Losing your hair can be devastating. Many people consider a thick head of hair a symbol of youth and vitality. So losing it — no matter how young you are — can make you feel old. It can make you feel less attractive. It can lower your overall self-esteem.

Remember that it is okay to feel what you’re feeling. It is also okay to seek out a strategy for stopping or even reversing hair loss. Wanting hair doesn’t mean that you are vain. You should not feel guilty about doing something about your hair loss.

If adequate treatment is not available for your type of hair loss, you may consider trying different hairstyles or wigs, hairpieces, hair weaves or artificial hair replacement.","• What is causing my hair loss?

• I have a fungal infection. How long will it take for the medicine to start working?

169,Halitosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/halitosis/,Halitosis is the term for bad breath. Bad breath can have many causes and could be a sign of an underlying health problem.,"Many people wake up with smelly breath, often called morning breath. But you may also have bad breath on and off throughout the day and not even know it. Here are some symptoms you may have that are associated with bad breath:

• Dry mouth
• Plaque around your teeth near the gumline
• A white coating on your tongue
• Postnasal drip of the feeling of sinuses draining down your throat
• A bad taste in your mouth, especially if it has a metallic taste","Most bad breath (also called halitosis) comes from something in your mouth. Food sticks between your teeth, around the gums and on your tongue. If you don’t brush and floss your teeth every day, this food can rot. The rotten bits of food cause a bad smell in your mouth. Rotten food also helps bacteria grow in your mouth. These bacteria can cause gum disease (also called gingivitis). Gingivitis also causes bad breath.

The things you eat and drink can also affect your breath. Common examples of foods and beverages that may cause bad breath include onions, garlic, cheese, pastrami, certain spices, orange juice and soda. Once these foods are digested, their oils are absorbed into your bloodstream and carried into the lungs. The odor is given off in your breath until all the food is out of your body.","If you believe you may have halitosis, you should ask your doctor. They may be able to diagnose you based on odor alone. They may also ask you some lifestyle questions about how often you brush your teeth or if you floss your teeth. Your doctor may also ask about the medicines you are taking. If your doctor does not believe your bad breath is related to an underlying dental condition, they may refer you to a dentist for evaluation.","There are many things you can do on your own to prevent bad breath. These include:

• Brushing your teeth at least 2 times every day, using a fluoride toothpaste. Be sure to brush along the gumline, as well as all tooth surfaces. Each time you brush your teeth, use your toothbrush to clean the surface of your tongue.
• Flossing your teeth at least once a day to remove food from between your teeth.
• Eating more fruits and vegetables every day. Eat less meat.
• Avoiding foods that cause you to have bad breath. Also try to avoid alcoholic beverages, which often cause bad breath.
• Avoiding using tobacco products. Any kind of tobacco can cause halitosis.

Sometimes a dry mouth has an unpleasant smell. If your mouth is dry, you can suck on sugar-free mints, chew sugar-free gum or sip more water. Most mouthwashes do not have a long-lasting effect on bad breath. If you use a mouthwash, swish it around in your mouth for 30 seconds before spitting it out.

If you wear removable dentures, take them out at night. Brush the dentures and soak them overnight in a disinfecting solution. Removable braces and retainers should also be cleaned. Follow the directions of your dentist.

You should see your dentist twice a year to have your teeth cleaned.",Halitosis treatment mostly includes the things listed above to prevent bad breath. But your doctor or dentist may also offer you a prescription mouthwash to help treat gum disease.,"If you can’t get rid of bad breath on your own, see your family doctor to find out if a more serious problem is causing it. Bad breath may be a sign of a health problem. Sinus infections, chronic lung infections, liver or kidney diseases, and diabetes are some health conditions that may cause bad breath.","• What is causing my bad breath?
• Do I need to change my toothpaste?
• Could chewing tobacco cause bad breath?
• How often should I see my dentist?
• Is there a mouthwash that might help?
• If I can’t get rid of my bad breath, what steps do we take to figure out what’s wrong?

170,Hammer Toe,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hammer-toe/,"When a person has hammer toe, the end of their toe bends downward and the middle joint curls up. Over time, the toe gets stuck in a stiff, claw-like position.

Hammer toe usually affects a person’s second toe (the toe next to the big toe). But it can affect other toes, too.","The main symptom of hammer toe is a toe that is bent upward at the middle joint. At first you may still be able to straighten out your toe. But over time, it will become painful and harder to do.

When the inside of your shoe rubs against a hammer toe, corns, blisters or calluses may form. They may form on top of the toe or on the bottom of your foot. This can make walking painful, especially with shoes on. You may also have pain in the joint where your big toe joins your foot.","The most common cause of hammer toe is wearing short, narrow shoes that are too tight. This causes the toe to bend upward. Muscles and tendons in the toe tighten and become shorter. This makes the toe stay in the bent position.

People who are born with long bones in their toes are more likely to develop hammer toe. Children who wear shoes they have outgrown may develop this condition. People who wear very narrow shoes or high-heeled shoes are also more likely to develop a hammer toe.

Sometimes, pressure from a bunion can cause hammer toe. Rheumatoid arthritis also can increase your risk.",Your doctor will be able to diagnose hammer toe by doing a physical examination of your foot.,"Avoid wearing shoes that are narrow or don’t fit well. Also, don’t wear heels higher than 2 inches. Instead, choose shoes with a wide toe box that give you ½ inch between the end of your longest toe and the inside tip of the shoe.

To prevent hammer toe in children, check often to make sure your child’s shoes fit, especially when he or she is having a growth spurt.","If the affected toe is still flexible, you may be able to treat it by taping or splinting the toe to hold it straight. Your family doctor can show you how to do this.

You may need to do certain exercises to keep your toe joints flexible. For example, you may need to move and stretch your toe gently with your hands. You can also exercise by picking things up with your toes. Small or soft objects, such as marbles or towels, work best.

If your toe becomes painful, you can apply an ice pack several times a day. This can help relieve the soreness and swelling. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (also called NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (one brand name: Aleve), may be helpful. If your pain and swelling are severe, your doctor may need to give you a steroid injection in the toe joint.

If you have a severe case of hammer toe or if the affected toe is no longer flexible, you may need surgery to straighten your toe joint. Surgery usually requires only a local anesthetic (numbing medicine for the affected area). It is usually an outpatient procedure. This means you don’t have to stay in the hospital for the surgery.","If your hammer toe is not severe, there are things you can do help your symptoms.

• Wear the right size shoe. Try to avoid shoes that are too tight or too narrow.
• Avoid high heels as much as you can.
• Wear shoes with soft insoles or purchase soft insoles you can insert into your shoes. This will help relieve pressure on the toe.
• Protect the joint that is sticking up by using corn pads or felt pads.","• What is the likely cause of my hammer toe?
• How do I know that my or my child’s shoes fit correctly?
• What is the best treatment option for me? Will I need surgery?
• How long before I can expect relief from my symptoms?
• Is it possible that my symptoms could return, even after treatment?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? What kind of shoes should I wear?","Mayo Clinic: Hammer Toe and Mallet Toe

171,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)",https://familydoctor.org/condition/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease/,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood illness. It is caused by a virus and is very contagious, but not severe. The disease is easy to spot because of its symptoms: sores or blisters inside and outside the mouth as well as a rash (red spots) or sores on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Infants and children younger than age 5 are most likely to get the virus. But older children, teens, and adults can get it, too. A mild outbreak of the disease commonly occurs during summer and early fall. This disease shouldn’t be confused with foot-and-mouth disease, which affects sheep, cattle, and pigs.","The common symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease are:

• Painful sores or blisters around or in the mouth (cheeks, gums, and throat)
• Rash of flat red spots on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. These mildly painful spots may turn into blisters and can sometimes spread to the knees, elbows, bottom, or genital areas.
• Fever (which can be high)
• Headache
• Feeling unwell or overly tired
• Poor appetite
• Sore throat

These symptoms don’t usually appear all at once, but in stages. Your child may not have every symptom. Some people, especially adults, get the disease and don’t show any symptoms. They can still pass it on to others.

Symptoms usually appear 3 to 7 days after coming into contact with someone with the disease. Further symptoms can develop from complications. Because the sores make it painful to swallow, children and adults can become dehydrated. High fevers can cause seizures.","HFMD is caused by either coxsackieviruses or human enteroviruses. It is found in the digestive tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.

The virus spreads when a sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose. You can get it if you touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after touching something contaminated with the virus, such as a toy. You can also get it if you touch the stool (poop) or blisters of a person who is infected.","Your child’s doctor will review signs of illness and examine your child’s sores or blisters to diagnose HFMD. In some cases, you child’s doctor may swab the back of your child’s throat to send to a lab. They may ask you to collect a stool sample from your child to send to a lab. The lab can test for the virus and rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.","HFMD is contagious. It’s important to avoid contact with anyone who has it. You won’t always know when another person has the virus, especially in the early stages. Make sure you and your child practice good hygiene:

• Wash your hands often and well with soap and water.
• Encourage your child to cover their mouth and nose when they sneeze.
• Try not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, especially with unwashed hands.
• Disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs or toys, especially if someone is sick.","There is no cure for HFMD. Antibiotics won’t work since it’s caused by a virus. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.

Your doctor may recommend tips to relieve your child’s discomfort:

• Take over-the-counter pain relievers to treat fever and sore throat. These could include acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (one brand name: Advil). Check the back of the box or ask your doctor about dosage directions. Don’t give a child under 18 years old aspirin for pain. Aspirin has been linked to Reye’s syndrome, a rare but serious condition that can be deadly without early treatment.
• Gargle with salt water to relieve sore throat pain. Combine ½ teaspoon salt with 1 glass of warm water and stir.
• Get plenty of fluids. Water, cold milk products, or Pedialyte are best. Avoid juice and soda which can burn or irritate mouth sores. If your child is having difficulty swallowing, try giving them non-juice popsicles.","Symptoms of HFMD often go away on their own. As a parent caring for a child who has the virus, your primary goals are to keep your child hydrated and rested. You should keep your child at home to avoid spreading it to other people. Your child should fully recover in 5 to 7 days. Contact your child’s doctor if symptoms continue or worsen.

There is currently no vaccine in the United States to protect against the viruses that cause HFMD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, research is underway to develop a vaccine to help prevent the disease in the future.","• How long is my child contagious?
• Does the virus spread by touching infected sores or blisters?
• Can you apply an ointment to the sores to relieve the pain?
• Do the sores or blisters leave long-term scars?
• Do the sores inside your mouth take longer to heal than the sores on your hands and feet?
• My child has HFMD. Do I need to stay home from work, too?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease

172,Hashimoto's Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hashimotos-disease/,"Hashimoto’s disease is an autoimmune disease that affects your thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located in the front of your neck, below your voice box. It makes hormones that control metabolism. This includes things like your heart rate and how quickly you burn calories. When you have Hashimoto’s disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid gland. This causes it to become swollen and irritated. When this happens, your thyroid can’t make hormones as it normally does.","Many people who have Hashimoto’s disease have no symptoms at all. If the disease does enough damage to the thyroid, it can cause hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid disease). This is because the attack on the thyroid causes the gland to produce fewer hormones. Symptoms of Hashimoto’s disease include:

• Fatigue.
• Weight gain.
• Increased sensitivity to cold.
• Joint and muscle pain or stiffness.
• Pale, dry skin.
• Puffy face.
• Hoarse voice.
• Constipation.
• Heavier than normal periods in women.
• Elevated cholesterol.
• Depression.
• Visibly enlarged thyroid.
• Forgetfulness or memory problems.","Hashimoto’s disease is an autoimmune disease. Normally, the immune system produces antibodies. These help protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign substances. Sometimes your immune system produces antibodies that attack your body’s tissues and/or organs. This is an autoimmune disease. When you have Hashimoto’s disease, these antibodies attack your thyroid. Doctors are not sure why people get this disease.","Your doctor will do a physical exam. He or she will ask about your symptoms and your medical history. They will order blood tests that can tell if your thyroid gland is working properly. The tests can measure hormone levels to check for Hashimoto’s disease.

Your doctor may also order imaging tests. These could include an ultrasound or CT scan. These tests allow your doctor to see images of your thyroid gland to look for problems. Imaging tests are usually not needed to diagnose Hashimoto’s disease.",There is no known way to prevent or avoid Hashimoto’s disease.,"Hashimoto’s disease has no cure. But it can be treated with medicine. This will minimize any long-term effects. It is treated with a synthetic thyroid hormone. This hormone replaces the hormones your thyroid gland usually makes. The medicine is taken daily in pill form. It regulates hormone levels and shifts your metabolism back to normal. It also lowers your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It may help reverse weight gain. How long you need to take the medicine will depend on the results of your blood tests. For most people, taking thyroid hormone medicine causes no problems.

To help prevent symptoms, always take your thyroid medicine. Also get regular blood tests to see how your thyroid gland is working. Some medicines, supplements, and foods may affect your body’s ability to absorb the synthetic thyroid hormone. Tell your doctor if you:

• Eat large amounts of soy products.
• Are on a high-fiber diet.
• Take other medicines. These could include iron or calcium supplements, cholestyramine, or aluminum hydroxide (found in some antacids).","Hashimoto’s disease often stays stable for many years. If it does progress to hypothyroidism, it is easily treated.

If you are diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease and plan to become pregnant, you should talk to your doctor. Hypothyroidism can affect both you and your baby if left untreated. You’ll need to be careful and watch for symptoms of hypothyroidism throughout your pregnancy. Thyroid medicines are generally safe to take during pregnancy.","• What is the likely cause of my Hashimoto’s disease?

173,Head Injuries,https://familydoctor.org/condition/head-injuries/,"A head injury is any harm to your brain, skull, or scalp. Head injuries can be mild, moderate, or severe. Common types include:

• Concussion: This is a jarring injury to your brain. Most of the time, people remain conscious. They may feel dazed, have visual changes, headaches, neck pain, or other changes in cognitive function.
• Brain contusion: This is a bruise of your brain. Minor bleeding in your brain causes swelling.
• Skull fracture: This is a crack in your skull. Sometimes, the broken skull bones can cut into your brain. This causes bleeding and can lead to another injury.
• Hematoma: This is a collection of blood that can occur inside the skull next to the brain or outside the skull under the scalp. It can appear right away or may take several days.","With a head injury, it’s common to have a headache and nausea. You may be dizzy or disoriented right afterward. You also may have problems focusing or remembering. Other symptoms include ringing in your ears, neck pain, emotional or vision problems. These symptoms often go away in a few weeks but may last longer if the injury is severe.

Get help right away if you notice the following:

• Any symptom that gets worse, such as headaches, nausea, or fatigue
• Frequent vomiting
• Drastic changes in behavior, such as anger or confusion
• Pupils that are bigger than normal (dilated) or different sizes
• Trouble walking or speaking
• Problems breathing
• Drainage of bloody or clear fluids from the ears or nose
• Weakness or numbness in the arms or legs
• Loss of consciousness
• Seizures","There are several causes of head injuries. You may get injured playing a sport or activity. Certain jobs, such as construction, contain risk of a head injury. Children or elderly people may fall around the house and get hurt. Severe head injuries are most likely to occur in a car, motorcycle, or bicycle wreck.","You should see a doctor if you think you have a head injury. They will ask about how the injury happened, your symptoms, and past health problems. Tell them if you’ve had serious symptoms, such as vomiting or seizures. The doctor also may ask questions to test your memory and mental function. Examples include, “What is your name?” “What day is it?” and “Where are you?” You may need to stay in the hospital. This allows the doctor to watch and monitor your condition.

Most head injuries do not require imaging (taking pictures of your head). If your doctor wants an image, they may order a computerized tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These scans check for damage and help the doctor diagnose an injury.","You cannot always avoid head injuries, but you can do things to decrease your risk. These include:

• Wearing a seatbelt in the car
• Wearing a helmet on a motorcycle or bicycle
• Wearing proper protective gear at work or when playing sports
• Keeping a close watch on children and elderly people for falls or accidents","A mild head injury may require only a brief period of rest followed by gradual return to activity. However, you should know the signs to look for in case a problem begins. Your doctor can help you determine this. Severe injuries often require medical attention and a hospital stay. You may need surgery to treat the condition.

Call 911 if you are with someone who has a severe head injury. You also should follow these guidelines:

• If the person is bleeding, try to stop it. Use gauze, a towel, or a piece of clothing. Do not touch the wound. If the wound is open, do not apply pressure. Cover or wrap the wound instead.
• If the person is vomiting, keep them upright. If they are lying down, roll their body to the side to prevent choking.
• If the person is awake, instruct them not to move their head and neck. This can help prevent further damage to their spine and brain.
• If the person is unconscious and breathing, try to stabilize their body. This includes keeping their neck and head in line with their spine.
• If the person is unconscious and not breathing, begin the process of CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).","Most people recover from head injuries with no lasting effects. However, damage can occur if your brain moves or is pierced. Talk to your doctor about how to manage side effects or symptoms, such as pain.

After a head injury, you may have memory loss. For example, you may forget the events right before, during, and after the accident. Memory of these events may or may not come back. Following treatment, the ability to learn and remember new things often returns.","• How can I tell if a head injury is mild or severe?
• How do I care for someone who has suffered a head injury?

174,Head Lice,https://familydoctor.org/condition/head-lice/,"Head lice are small wingless insects (bugs) that can get on your hair and scalp. Lice are parasites, which means that they feed on very small amounts of your blood. Lice bites may cause constant scratching and lead to skin irritation or even infection.","Because lice move very fast, they’re not always easy to see. Here’s what you can watch for:

• Frequent scratching or itching.
• The feeling something is moving in your hair.
• Small red bumps or sores on the scalp, neck, and shoulders.
• Lice eggs, also called nits, which look like tiny, oval shaped, white, or clear dots. Nits usually stick at an angle (45 degrees) on hair shafts.

If you think someone in your family has head lice, it’s probably best to check everyone in the family. If you’re not sure, your family doctor can help diagnose head lice.","Anyone can get head lice, but it’s more common among school-aged children. Head lice spread more easily among children 3 years to 12 years of age because they share their belongings more often than adults and they play closely together.

It’s not true that people get head lice because they’re dirty. Head lice are very contagious. No matter how many times you or your child takes a shower or washes his or her hair, it’s still possible to get head lice from head-to-head contact with someone who is already infested with lice. You can also get head lice if you share hats, towels, pillows, combs, or brushes with someone who has head lice.","In most cases, you should be able to diagnose head lice yourself. Finding a live nymph (young) or adult louse on the scalp or hair is enough for a positive diagnosis of head lice.

If you find only nits (eggs) attached to hair, chances are still fairly strong that there is a lice infestation. However, if the nits are positioned more than ¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft, they most likely are dead and will not hatch. If you see these nits and no live bugs, you no longer have active head lice.

If you can’t find any lice but are still having symptoms, see your doctor for help with the diagnosis.","It may be difficult to prevent head lice from spreading among children, but the following are some steps you can take to help keep lice away:

• Ask your child not to share combs, brushes, or hair decorations.
• Ask your child not to try on hats that belong to other children.
• If your child will be sleeping away from home, be sure to pack his or her own pillow and towels.","Head lice can be treated with over-the-counter or prescription medicines. Over-the-counter shampoos and lotions containing pyrethrin (one brand name: Rid) or permethrin (brand name: Nix) are commonly used. Shampoos and lotions that kill head lice contain pesticides and other chemicals. It’s important to talk to your doctor before using these products, especially if you’re pregnant or nursing, or if you have allergies or asthma. It’s also not safe to use products with pesticides on or near your eyes. If you find head lice or nits in eyelashes or brows, talk to your doctor.

If over-the-counter products are not effective, your doctor can prescribe a cream, lotion, or shampoo to treat your head lice. Certain prescription medicines are also safer for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

The products that kill head lice don’t usually kill all nits. To reduce the risk of another lice infestation, pick the remaining lice and nits by hand or by using a special comb (one brand name: LiceMeister) to remove them. Comb through all of the hair, one section at a time, every 3 days or more often. Do this for at least 2 weeks or until you stop seeing head lice and nits. A repeat treatment might be needed in 10-14 days.

You should also use hot water to wash any bed linens, towels, and clothing recently worn by the person who had head lice. Vacuum anything that can’t be washed, such as the couch, carpets, your child’s car seat, and any stuffed animals. Because head lice don’t live very long away from the scalp, you don’t need to use lice spray on these items.","The good news is that you don’t have to live with head lice for long, although it may feel like a long time. It may take a few treatments and a few weeks to get rid of them completely.

Head lice can’t jump or fly. Only the direct contact with an infested person or their contaminated items can spread lice. Encourage your young and school-aged children to take the precautions listed above to avoid future cases of head lice.","• What is the best way to get rid of head lice?
• Should I use a special shampoo?
• Will I need a prescription shampoo?

200,High-Altitude Illness,https://familydoctor.org/condition/high-altitude-illness/,"High-altitude illness, or sickness, is a condition that can occur when you travel to a high altitude, such as the mountains. It’s also called mountain sickness. It usually happens at altitudes higher than 8,000 feet. At this altitude, there’s less oxygen. When you go from low to high altitudes, your body needs time to adjust to the change in oxygen levels. Therefore, high-altitude illness happens when your body doesn’t get enough oxygen.

Talk to your doctor if you plan to travel to altitudes.","Symptoms of high-altitude illness usually begin 12 to 24 hours after you reach a high altitude. Early symptoms include:

• Headache
• Dizziness
• Nausea
• Trouble breathing when active
• Weakness or fatigue
• Trouble sleeping
• Increased heart rate

If you have these symptoms, stop, rest, and drink water. You may need to go back down to a lower altitude until your symptoms go away.

• Trouble breathing at rest
• Chest tightness or pain
• Coughing
• Vomiting
• Confusion
• Inability to walk in a straight line
• Pale, gray, or blue skin

If you have these symptoms, go to a lower altitude right away and get medical help. Symptoms that are ignored or left untreated can be life threatening.","You may have heard that the air is “thinner” at higher altitudes. This means that your body can’t get as much oxygen. High-altitude illness most often occurs at altitudes higher than 8,000 feet. It can cause problems for people whose bodies aren’t used to working on so little oxygen.

There are 3 main types of high-altitude illness.

• Acute mountain sickness:This is the most common form of the condition. It’s often mild and short-term.
• High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE):This condition causes your lungs to swell with fluid, which can be fatal. It occurs at extreme high altitudes.
• High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE):This condition causes your brain to swell with fluid, which can be fatal. It occurs at extreme high altitudes.

Everyone is at risk for high-altitude illness. Children and older adults are at an increased risk because it takes their bodies longer to adjust. You also may be at a greater risk if you:

• Live in a place with a low altitude and travel to a place with a high altitude
• Live in a place that has a high altitude
• Climb or ascend altitudes too quickly.
• Are dehydrated.
• Have had high-altitude illness before.
• Have a health condition that makes it hard to breathe normally.","People who have symptoms of high-altitude illness should see a doctor. Be sure to tell him or her about the conditions you were in when you had the symptoms. Your doctor will do a physical exam. Based on the severity of your symptoms, he or she may order tests. Tests may include a chest X-ray, brain scan, or electrocardiogram (ECG). These help diagnose the type of illness and decide on a treatment plan.","There are 3 important things you can do to prevent high-altitude illness.

• Take your time traveling to higher altitudes. It takes several days for your body to fully adjust to lower amounts of oxygen at high altitudes. This is true even for people who are healthy. Most people can safely go from sea level to an altitude of 8,000 feet in a few days. Once you reach 8,000 feet, you shouldn’t go up more than 1,000 to 2,000 feet per day. The higher you get, the longer it takes your body to adjust. Plan your trip so your body has time to get used to the high altitude before you start your physical activity.
• Sleep at a low altitude, if possible.For example, if you ski at 10,000 feet during the day, sleep at a lower elevation at night. This lets your body rest and recover while you sleep.
• Hydrate before, during, and after you travel. Dehydration can increase your risk of high-altitude illness. You should drink extra water several days before and after you travel. Make sure you pack enough water while you’re active. Avoid or limit the amount of alcohol you consume.

If you have a chronic illness, talk to your doctor before you travel to a high altitude. Depending on the type and severity of your chronic illness, your doctor can let you know if it’s safe for you to travel there.

Most people who have heart or lung disease can safely spend time at a high altitude if their condition is under control. Likewise, it’s usually safe for people who have coronary artery disease, mild emphysema, or high blood pressure to travel to a high-altitude. You won’t make those diseases worse by being there. Being overweight also doesn’t increase your risk.

However, high altitudes can be very dangerous for people who have:

• Sickle cell anemia
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
• Severe emphysema
• Severe heart disease

There is little information about the risk of high-altitude illness during pregnancy. Some experts recommend that pregnant women not travel to an altitude higher than 8,000 feet. If you’re pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before you travel to a high altitude.

Generally, it’s safe for children to go to high altitudes. However, they’re more likely to get high-altitude illness because their bodies have a hard time adjusting to the low oxygen level. Kids also may not be able to recognize the symptoms of high-altitude illness. That’s why it’s important for parents and other adults to carefully watch for signs of the illness in children.","It’s important to treat high-altitude illness as soon as symptoms begin. The first thing you should do is to safely go down to a lower altitude right away. If your symptoms are mild, you may be able to stay at that altitude and let your body adjust. If you do this, don’t exercise. Rest and drink water until you feel better. It may help to use a device that provides extra oxygen.

If needed, your doctor may prescribe medicine to prevent or treat symptoms. One example is acetazolamide. When taking this medicine, drink a lot of water and avoid alcohol.

If your symptoms are severe, continue to go down to a lower altitude until you’re no longer sick. If your symptoms don’t improve or get worse, call a doctor or go to the nearest hospital. You will need medical treatment.","Don’t ignore signs of high-altitude illness. Symptoms that are ignored or left untreated can be life threatening. Don’t go higher until you feel better and your symptoms have gone away completely. Once your body adjusts, it should eventually get used to the low oxygen level. Over time, you shouldn’t get sick anymore. This is helpful for people who move to a higher altitude to live.","• I’m traveling to a place with high altitudes. How can I prevent high-altitude illness?
• If I am pregnant or have a chronic condition, are high altitudes safe for me?
• How much water should I drink before I travel? How much water should I drink while in high altitudes?
• I’m moving to a place with high altitudes. What’s the best way to prepare my body and adjust to the low oxygen level?

175,Headaches,https://familydoctor.org/condition/headaches/,"A headache is a pain that occurs in your head, upper neck or even your face. There are several different types of headaches. Migraines and tension headaches are the most common. Other types are cluster headaches and rebound headaches.","The main symptom of headaches is head pain. Other symptoms vary, based on the type.","The exact cause of headaches varies and is not always known.

• Change in body chemicals
• Genetics
• Environmental factors

A lot of factors can cause tension headaches. These include:

• Stress
• Sleep problems
• Sinus and allergy problems
• Stiff or sore muscles, brought on by jaw clenching or poor posture
• Depression
• Anxiety
• Hormonal changes in women
• Certain medicines
• Certain foods and beverages

Cluster headaches do not appear to be related to health conditions or diseases of the brain. Some of the triggers of cluster headaches include:

• Taking certain medicines, such as nitroglycerin
• Heavy smoking
• Drinking alcohol
• A change in your normal sleep pattern
• Abnormal levels of certain hormones
• Problems with your hypothalamus, which is the part of your brain that controls your body’s “biological clock”

Overuse of medicine is the main cause of rebound headaches. Be careful taking too much of certain medicines. These include:

• Pain medicines
• Over-the-counter medicines
• Sedatives
• Tranquilizers
• Ergotamine medicines
• Other prescriptions

If you get rebound headaches, these medicines should not be taken more than 2 days a week. Talk with your doctor to find out if you should stop taking these medicines altogether.","Your doctor often can tell what kind of headache you have. They can do this by examining you and reviewing your symptoms. It may help if you keep track of the time and pattern of your headaches, as well as how they feel. This can help determine what the causes, or triggers, are and how to treat them. It also helps to rate your level of pain on a scale. A good way to do this is the keep a headache journal.

In rare cases, the doctor may perform tests to aid in a diagnosis. These could include lab tests to check your blood or chemical levels. They also could include imaging tests, such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.",You cannot completely prevent headaches. You may be able to lower how many headaches you have by identifying what causes your headaches.,"The most common treatments for headaches are rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. These include aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Always check the label when choosing an over-the-counter pain reliever. You want to look for side effects or possible drug interactions with other medicines you take. Make sure you read and follow the directions on the label carefully. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Keep in mind that children should not take aspirin. It can cause a serious illness called Reye’s syndrome in children younger than 18 years of age.

It is best to treat headaches when they begin or when they are still mild. It is harder to treat and get rid of headaches once the pain is worse. Talk to your doctor if these common treatments don’t work. They can suggest a different treatment option.

Certain prescription medicines can prevent headaches. Examples include:

• Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline
• Antiepileptic drugs, such as valproic acid, gabapentin, and topiramate
• Beta blockers, such as propranolol

These medicines can help prevent or reduce the number of headaches you get. It can take 6 weeks or more for the medicine to start working. Talk to your doctor about whether one of these medicines is right for you. It is important to follow your doctor’s instructions. Most prescriptions need to be taken each day. Always carry your medicine with you in case you get a headache.

Several treatments are available for people who have cluster headaches. Work with your doctor to discuss the pros, cons, and side effects. Select the right treatment for you and set up a schedule for prescription medicines.

Your doctor will probably prescribe two medicines. The first medicine is preventive. You take it regularly during the entire cluster period. It helps to reduce the number of headaches you get. The second medicine is reactive. You take it to relieve the pain that occurs from a cluster headache.

These medicines can be very effective. They can reduce the number of headaches you get as well as the severity. Cluster headaches often begin quickly. You may not be able to get medical help, so you should have your medicine available. Take this as soon as an attack begins. You may want to tell family or friends about your headaches and medicines. This way, they can help you when you have an attack. For some people, oral medicines (taken by mouth) do not work fast enough. For this reason, your doctor may prescribe another form of medicine. This could be a nasal spray, injection (shot), or rectal suppository. Another treatment that works for some people is a local anesthetic. This is a numbing medicine that you apply to your nose.

At the start of a cluster headache, inhaling pure oxygen through a mask can help prevent the attack. However, this is not always practical since the headaches come on quickly.","Some types of headaches can be very painful. This is especially true if you get them on a regular basis. However, most people cope well with the right treatment.

In addition to medicine, a fixed daily routine can help manage your symptoms and prevent headaches. For instance, eating meals at regular hours. Other ways to help prevent headaches include:

• Putting a heat or ice pack on your head or neck
• Taking a hot shower or bath
• Going to bed and getting up at the same time each day
• Getting enough rest or sleep
• Avoiding things that cause stress and/or doing things that relieve stress
• Never skipping a meal or fasting
• Drinking plenty of water
• Getting at least 30 to 60 minutes of exercise 4 to 6 times a week.

It is important to know what triggers your headaches, especially if you have them often. Keeping a headache journal can help you figure out what these triggers may be. A journal can help you keep track of your activities, food, and even the weather leading up to your headaches.

Some patients try alternative options for headache relief. Examples include acupuncture or chiropractic treatments. Talk to your doctor about the potential risks and benefits of these treatments. Keep in mind that not all alternative treatments are proven effective. For instance, herbal medicines are not tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ask your doctor about taking herbal medicines. They can check for drug interactions with other medicines you take.

Another alternative treatment is mind-body therapy. This focuses on the connection between your mind and body. You can do some types of mind-body therapy on your own.

• Close your eyes, take deep breaths, and focus on your breath or a positive thought.
• Allow your muscles to release tension by applying heat or cold to the area. If heat works, take a hot shower or bath. Use a heating pad on a low setting or a hot water bottle. If cold works, try a cold pack wrapped in a thin towel to protect your skin.
• Rub your head and temples or the muscles in your neck and shoulders. Massages help release tension and pressure, and relieve aches.

Other types of mind-body therapy are biofeedback and cognitive behavior. Biofeedback is a technique where you use your thoughts to control your body. Biofeedback may help with physical and mental health problems. Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of counseling called talk therapy. It may help you identify triggers so you can stop them before headaches occur. Cognitive behavior therapy can help ease stress and treat health problems.","• What type of headaches do I have, and what is the cause?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","A migraine is an intense, pounding headache. You can get them once or often, and they can last for hours or days. Migraines are more common in women than men.

Tension headaches often are brought on by stress. They frequently start in the middle of the day. They may be mild or severe and get worse over time.

Sinus headaches are caused by sinus pressure. Your sinuses are small, air-filled spaces located behind your nose, cheekbones, and forehead. When your sinuses get irritated by an infection or allergies, these spaces become swollen. This irritation also triggers your sinuses to begin overproducing mucus. Both of these contribute to sinus pressure.

A cluster headache is a rare type of headache. Cluster headaches typically start all of a sudden and occur once or more each day for a period of time. Often, they occur at the same time(s) each day. The period may last days or up to 12 weeks.

On average, each headache lasts about 45 to 90 minutes. The most common times for cluster headaches to occur are between 1 and 2 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m., and around 9 p.m. Cluster headaches are more common in men than women.

People who have problems with medicine or substance abuse get rebound headaches. These headaches occur most days early in the morning. They also are sometimes referred to as medication-overuse headaches.

If headache pain is getting in the way of your daily activities, it’s time to see your family doctor. Read More

Migraines are defined by pounding or pulsing head pain. The pain may begin in your forehead, the side of your head, or around your eyes. Migraines often get worse and are hard to get rid of. Movement, bright lights, and loud noises can make the pain worse. Nausea and vomiting are common. You also may have blurry vision or be lightheaded.

The pain from tension headaches is constant and dull. You may feel it on both sides of your head or around your head, like a band. In addition to pain, you may feel tightness or pressure. The headaches can cause aches in your jaw or neck. If you regularly use a computer for work, adjusting your work station so that your head is looking forward instead of downward will also help.

Sinus pressure results in headache-like pain in your forehead, around your eyes, or around your nose and cheeks. Straining or sudden movement makes the pain even worse. You may have other symptoms, as well. These include a runny nose, swollen face, and sometimes fever. Your ears may also feel stopped up or like they have pressure, too.

The pain from cluster headaches often is severe. It may occur behind or around one or both eyes. The headaches can cause your eyes or nose to become red and swollen. They also can make you feel restless.

The pain and symptoms from rebound headaches can vary. Nausea and vomiting are common. You may be anxious, irritable or depressed, or have trouble sleeping.

Medicine to prevent migraines may be helpful if your headaches happen more than 2 times a month. Preventive medicines for migraines can include prescription drugs often used to treat other ailments. Anti-seizure medicines, antidepressants, medicines to lower blood pressure, and even Botox injections are some of the preventive medicines your doctor may prescribe. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors can also help prevent migraines. They do so by blocking a gene-related peptide in your sensory nerves. This peptide is known to increase during a migraine attack, so blocking it can help prevent migraines.

There are also a number of non-medical treatments designed to help minimize migraine pain and frequency. One is an electrical stimulation device, which has been approved by the FDA. It is a headband that you wear once a day for 20 minutes to stimulate the nerve linked to migraines. Another non-medical treatment is counseling aimed at helping you feel in more control of your migraines. This counseling works best when paired with medical prevention of migraines as well.

One way to help prevent tension headaches is to improve your posture. Improved posture can help prevent your muscles from becoming tense or tight. You can practice this while you’re sitting and while you’re standing. While sitting, make sure shoulders are back and your head isn’t slumped forward or backward. This is especially important as you work at your computer and look at your phone. When standing, make sure to hold shoulders back while also tightening your stomach muscles. Straighten your neck and hold your head level.

Keeping sinuses moist and clean may help prevent sinus headaches. Consider adding a humidifier to your bedroom. This can help your nose from becoming dry and irritated. Talk to your doctor about also using a tool to flush out sinuses. Your doctor may recommend using a neti pot or bulb syringe. This will moisten sinuses and help clean out mucus, too.

Drinking alcohol and smoking or vaping can trigger cluster headaches. Avoiding triggers may help you prevent cluster headaches. Your doctor may also prescribe calcium channel blockers for prevention.

The best way to prevent rebound headaches is to limit your use of pain relievers. You should use them only when you need them and no more than twice a week. If you feel like you need to use them more often, talk to your doctor. You should also avoid caffeine when taking pain relievers. This is because many pain relievers already contain caffeine. A double dose of caffeine can cause a headache or make it worse."
176,Hearing Problems in Children,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hearing-problems-in-children/,"There are many types of hearing problems in children. Many of these problems result in hearing loss. This loss may be only temporary, but it can also be permanent. It’s important that parents and other caretakers recognize the signs of hearing loss. The sooner you recognize a hearing problem, the better it will be for your child.

Children learn how to talk by hearing and imitating the sounds of people around them. And children start to learn about language and speech before they learn to talk. So the sooner your child has access to sound, the better. If your baby has a hearing problem, exploring communication options early on can help avoid speech delays and problems.",Signs of hearing loss in very young children may not be easy to notice. Hearing problems may not become obvious until children are 12 to 18 months of age. This is when they should begin saying their first words. Children who can’t hear well often respond to their environment by using their senses of sight and touch. This can hide their hearing problems.,There are many things that can cause hearing problems in children. Some children are born with hearing loss. This is called congenital hearing loss. Hearing loss that occurs later is call acquired hearing loss.,"Children who are born with hearing problems can usually be diagnosed with a hearing screening. All babies should have a hearing screening within 1 month after being born. Many hospitals screen newborn babies for hearing problems. If your newborn baby hasn’t had a hearing screening, talk with your doctor.

Answer the following questions about your child to identify signs of a hearing problem. If you answer “no” to any question, ask your family doctor if your child should be checked for hearing problems.","Some types of hearing loss can’t be prevented or avoided. Most types of congenital hearing loss can’t be prevented. There are a few exceptions. Congenital hearing loss caused by a mother’s abuse of drugs or alcohol while pregnant can be avoided.

More types of acquired hearing loss are preventable. You can help your child avoid hearing loss by:

• Seeing that ear infections are medically treated
• Making sure your child always wears a helmet when riding bikes and skateboards to prevent head trauma
• Keeping your child away from prolonged loud noises
• Noticing early signs of a hearing problem","Hearing problems can be temporary or permanent. Ear infections or fluid or pressure changes in the middle ear can cause temporary hearing problems. These will go away with time or treatment. Most permanent hearing problems are present at birth. They may be hereditary (run in families) or may be caused by medical problems. In some cases, the cause of a hearing problem may be unknown.

If your child has permanent hearing loss, talk to your doctor about communication options. Several types of hearing devices are available for children. Your doctor may refer you to an audiologist who can help you decide which hearing device is right for your child. Your audiologist may also talk with you about other options to help your child communicate. He or she may recommend lip-reading or sign language. Talk to him or her about whether your child may also benefit from listening therapy or speech therapy.","Hearing loss ranges from mild to profound. There are many tools that can help your child hear. The type of hearing loss he or she has will determine which tools can work for him or her. If your child’s hearing loss is mild to moderate, a good hearing aid can help him or her. If his or her hearing loss is severe to profound, he or she may benefit from a cochlear implant.

The most important thing is that your child learns to communicate despite his or her hearing loss. This may mean that you and your child need to learn sign language. Your child may need to learn how to read lips. Be flexible and patient. Know that there are many professionals who can help you reach communication goals for your child.","• My child’s hearing problem seemed to happen after he/she had an ear infection. Will it go away?
• My young child doesn’t react when I clap or say his/her name. Could he/she have a hearing problem?
• Many people in my family have hearing problems. How soon should I have my child tested?
• If my child is deaf, how can I communicate with him/her?
• I’ve heard about cochlear implants. Can you tell me about them?
• Should my child have a hearing aid?
• Will my child learn to talk?","National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, Hearing, Ear Infections, and Deafness

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Sometimes doctors can identify what caused congenital hearing loss but often they can’t. This type of hearing loss can be genetic (it runs in families) or non-genetic.

There are a few ways parents can pass along hearing loss to their child (genetic loss).

• Both parents carry the recessive gene for hearing loss and pass it along.
• One parent carries the dominant gene for hearing loss and passes it along.
• One parent passes along a genetic syndrome (Down Syndrome, Usher Syndrome, etc.).

Non-genetic causes are most often related to illness or trauma before or during birth. Common non-genetic causes of hearing loss in children include:

• An infection in the mother while pregnant, such as cytomegalovirus, rubella (German measles), and herpes simplex virus
• Premature birth
• Maternal diabetes
• Drug or alcohol abuse during pregnancy

Acquired hearing loss can happen at any time in your life. It is usually caused by an injury or illness. Here are just a few things that can cause acquired hearing loss:

• Serious head injury
• Frequent ear infections
• Medicines that harm the ear
• A hole in the ear drum
• Infections and viruses, such as meningitis, encephalitis, chicken pox, and measles
• Fluid in the middle ear
• Sustained exposure to loud noises"
177,Hearing: Noise-Induced Hearing Loss,https://familydoctor.org/condition/noise-induced-hearing-loss/,"Noise-induced hearing loss is permanent hearing loss that is caused by being around loud noises over a long period of time. It also can occur after you are exposed to loud noise in a short period of time, such as a gunshot or explosion. The more you are around loud noises, the greater your risk hearing loss.

Whether noise harms your hearing depends on the loudness, the pitch, and the length of time you are exposed to the noise. The loudness of a sound (measured in decibels, or dB) and the length of exposure are related. The louder the sound, the shorter the exposure can be before damage occurs. For example, 8 hours of exposure to 85-dB noise daily can begin to damage a person’s ears over time. Using power tools (at about 100 dB), listening to loud stereo headsets (at about 110 dB), attending a rock concert (at about l20 dB), or hearing a gunshot (at 140 to 170 dB) may damage the hearing of some people after only a few times.","One reason people fail to notice the danger of noise is that too much exposure to noise causes few symptoms. Hearing loss is rarely painful. The symptoms are usually vague:

• Feelings of pressure or fullness in the ears
• Speech that seems to be muffled or far away
• A ringing sound in the ears that you notice when you are in quiet places

These symptoms may go away minutes, hours, or days after the exposure to noise ends.

People assume that if the symptoms go away, their ears have “bounced back” to normal. This is not true. Even if there are no more symptoms, some of the cells in the inner ear may have been destroyed by the noise. Your hearing returns to normal if enough healthy cells are left in your inner ear. But you will develop a lasting hearing loss if the noise exposure is continues and more cells are destroyed.

The first sign of a noise-induced hearing loss is not hearing high-pitched sounds, like the singing of birds. It may also be not understanding speech when in a crowd or an area with a lot of background noise. If the damage goes on, hearing declines further, and lower pitched sounds become hard to understand.","The human ear is divided into 3 parts — the external, middle, and inner ear. The inner ear is located inside the skull. It is the most complex part of the ear. The soft tissue of the inner ear is made of different types of cells and nerves, all arranged in a pattern on a thin sheet of tissue. Large tubes filled with fluid surround the soft tissue of the inner ear. Hearing loss occurs when the inner ear is damaged.

Frequent exposure to loud or moderately loud noise over a long period of time can damage the cells and nerves in the inner ear. If enough cells and nerves are destroyed, hearing is permanently damaged.","Your doctor can offer a hearing test that will determine if you have a hearing loss. If the test shows that you have a hearing loss, you will be referred to an audiologist (ear care and hearing loss professionals) or otolaryngologist (a doctor with special training in ear and hearing disorders) for a more thorough hearing test. This test will determine the degree of hearing loss you have (mild, moderate, or profound). It also will identify for which frequencies (sound pitches: high sounds and low sounds) you have a hearing loss. For example, your hearing loss may affect only high frequencies (birds chirping) or low frequencies (a bass drum).

Hearing loss is usually progressive. That means it happens over a long period of time. Because it happens over time, you are less likely to notice that it is happening. If you are having trouble hearing in crowded places or it is difficult to talk on the phone, it may be time for a hearing test.","Following a few simple steps could protect you from noise-induced hearing loss.

• Reduce your exposure to noise. This step is especially important for people who work in noisy places and who go to and from work in noisy city traffic. Special earmuffs that protect your ears are available for people who work in noisy environments (such as around heavy machinery). You can also reduce your exposure to noise by choosing quiet leisure activities rather than noisy ones.
• Develop the habit of wearing earplugs when you know you will be exposed to noise for a long time. Disposable foam earplugs are inexpensive and are available in drugstores. These earplugs, which can quiet up to 25 dB of sound, can mean the difference between a dangerous and a safe level of noise. You should always wear earplugs when riding snowmobiles or motorcycles, attending concerts, when using power tools, lawn mowers or leaf blowers, or when traveling in loud motorized vehicles.
• Use sound-absorbing materials to reduce noise at home and at work. Put rubber mats under noisy kitchen appliances and computer printers to reduce noise. Curtains and carpeting also help reduce indoor noise. Storm windows or double-pane windows can reduce indoor noise. Storm windows or double-pane windows can reduce the amount of outside noise that enters the home or workplace.
• Don’t use several noisy machines at the same time. Keep television sets, stereos, and headsets low in volume. Loudness is a habit that can be broken.
• Don’t try to drown out unwanted noise with other sounds. For example, don’t turn up the volume on your car radio or headset to drown out traffic noise or turn up the television volume while vacuuming.
• Have your hearing checked if you are regularly exposed to loud noise at work or play.","There is no cure for permanent hearing loss. One of the most obvious “treatments” for this type of hearing loss is avoiding your exposure to noise. This can prevent your hearing loss from getting worse.

There is equipment that can help you hear better. Depending on the degree of your hearing loss, you may benefit from using a hearing aid (a device you wear in or on your ear to magnify sound). For profound hearing loss, you may qualify for a cochlear implant. A cochlear implant is an electronic hearing device that replaces the damaged inner ear with a ray of electrodes. These electrodes are surgically implanted in your inner ear. They provide sound signals to your brain.","Hearing allows you to be involved with the world around you. When you begin to lose hearing, you feel disconnected. Even isolated. You have learned most of what you know by listening to parents, teachers, television, and radio. Music, the sounds of nature, and the voices of loved ones can bring you pleasure; sirens and alarms can warn you about danger, even when you are asleep.

The first step to cope with this loss is to acknowledge it. Hearing loss is not something you should hide or be ashamed of. Once you recognize it, then you can begin to deal with the loss and take action to correct it, if possible. Being proactive about hearing loss can even stop its progression (continued development), saving you from greater hearing loss.

Recently, researchers have linked hearing loss to cognitive problems and even dementia. This means that people who have hearing loss are more likely to have these conditions also. However, studies are now finding that treating hearing loss can lessen this increased risk for dementia.","• How can I recognize that I have a hearing problem?
• Are there different types of hearing loss?
• Aren’t I too young to have hearing loss?
• Is there a medication that can help treat hearing loss?
• Will I be able to hear better with a hearing aid?
• Does my medical insurance pay for a hearing aid?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Preventing Noise-Induced Hearing Loss

• If a person standing near you can hear sounds from your stereo headset while it is on your head"
178,Heart Attack,https://familydoctor.org/condition/heart-attack/,"A heart attack happens when part of the heart muscle is cut off from oxygen. If the oxygen isn’t restored soon, a heart attack occurs. The blood in your coronary arteries carries oxygen to the heart muscle. Most heart attacks occur when a blockage slows or stops blood flow. Heart attack is sometimes called myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. Heart attacks are often treatable when diagnosed quickly. However, they can be fatal.

Women are less likely to survive heart attacks than men. No one knows why. It may be that women don’t seek or receive treatment as soon as men. Their symptoms can be different from what men experience. Their symptoms may be milder and more often overlooked. Or it may be because women’s smaller hearts and blood vessels are more easily damaged. Doctors are working on finding answers to these questions. It’s important to prevent heart problems before they start.

Before you leave the hospital, your doctor may talk to you about a cardiac rehabilitation program. These programs provide information that will help you understand your risk factors. It will help you live a healthy lifestyle that can prevent future heart problems. You will learn about exercise and diet, and how to reach and maintain a healthy weight. You will also learn ways to control your stress level, your blood pressure, and your cholesterol levels.

Your cardiac rehabilitation program will probably start while you are still in the hospital. After you leave the hospital, your rehabilitation will continue in a rehab center. The rehab center may be at the hospital or in another location.

Most cardiac rehabilitation programs last 3 to 6 months. Your doctor will talk to you about how often you need to attend the program. Once you enroll in a cardiac rehabilitation program, regular attendance is important. The more lifestyle changes you make, the better your chances of preventing future heart problems.

The sooner you get medical help, the greater your chances of surviving a heart attack. Do not delay getting immediate medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms of heart attack.","The most common symptoms of heart attack in both men and women include:

• Chest discomfort (also called angina), which may feel like pain, pressure, tightness, heaviness, or burning like heartburn
• Pain or discomfort in the neck, shoulders, lower jaw, arms, upper back, or abdomen
• Shortness of breath that lasts more than a few seconds

• Feeling lightheaded, dizzy, or faint
• Nausea and/or vomiting
• Unusual sweating
• Overwhelming fatigue
• Feeling anxious
• Heart palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating really fast, or out of rhythm)
• Feeling unusually tired for no reason (sometimes for multiple days)

The most common symptom for women is pain or discomfort in the chest. However, women are more likely to have a heart attack without having any chest pain. Therefore, women should pay close attention to other symptoms of heart attack. These include shortness of breath, sweating, fatigue, and dizziness.

If you think you may be having a heart attack, get treatment right away. Follow these steps:

• Dial 911 Do not have someone else drive you to the hospital. Do not try to drive yourself. EMT’s will give you life-saving treatment in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.
• After calling for help, take 1 uncoated adult aspirin (325 mg) or 4 uncoated baby aspirins (81 mg each). Don’t take this if you’re allergic to aspirin.
• If you are alone and are able, unlock your door to let emergency personnel enter your home.
• Sit in a comfortable chair and wait for help.
• Keep a phone near you.","A heart attack occurs when part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies from lack of oxygen. When a blockage occurs in your coronary arteries, blood and oxygen don’t get to the heart. This can lead to a heart attack if it isn’t treated quickly

Most heart attacks are a result of coronary heart or artery disease. A waxy substance called plaque builds up in the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. It takes years for the plaque to build up. When the plaque breaks up, it travels through the blood stream. This creates blood clots. The clots slow or stop blood flow to the heart. Then the heart doesn’t get enough oxygen. The tissue not receiving the oxygen begins to die.

Risk factors for a heart attack include:

• Smoking
• Diabetes
• Age. Risk increases for men older than 45 and for women older than 55 (or after menopause). About 83% of people who die from heart disease are 65 or older.
• High cholesterol
• High blood pressure
• High blood sugar
• Family history of heart attack
• Race. African Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans, and native Hawaiians are at greater risk.
• Lack of exercise
• Stress
• Obesity
• Gender. More men have heart attacks. But heart disease is the leading cause of death for American women.

A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm, or tightening, of a coronary artery. This can happen in an artery that doesn’t have plaque build-up. Instead, the tightening cuts off the blood flow. Spasms aren’t as well understood as a cause for heart attack. They seem to be related to:

• Taking specific drugs, such as cocaine
• Cigarette smoking
• Exposure to extreme cold
• Severe emotional pain or stress","You may need several tests to determine the cause of your symptoms.

• Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This test records the electrical activity of your heart. It can help diagnose heart rhythm problems. It can also find damage from a decrease in blood flow.
• Blood tests. When blood flow decreases, special proteins leak into the blood system. A blood test can detect these proteins. Your doctor may want to test your blood several times during the first 24 to 48 hours after yours symptoms start.

Other tests your doctor may want you to have include:

• Echocardiogram. This ultrasound test uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The pictures show how well your heart is pumping. It can show if there are problems with your heart valves.
• Chest X-ray. This looks at the size and shape of your heart. It can show if there is any fluid in your lungs.
• Nuclear imaging. This test injects a tiny radioactive substance into your blood. This substance travels to your heart to create pictures of it. It shows how well your heart is pumping. The radioactive substance is safe and leaves your body after the test is finished.
• Coronary angiography. This test is sometimes called cardiac catheterization. It involves inserting a long tube into a blood vessel. The tube is guided to the heart or arteries that carry blood to the heart. A substance is injected into the tube that makes it visible by X-ray. It allows your doctor to see where the blockage that caused the decrease in blood flow to your heart is located.","A healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart attack. This includes:

• Quitting smoking if you smoke and avoiding secondhand smoke
• Following a healthy diet that is low in fat and cholesterol
• Exercising regularly
• Managing stress
• Controlling your blood pressure
• Managing your blood sugar (if you have diabetes)
• Seeing your doctor regularly for check-ups","HRT is used to treat the symptoms of menopause. However, new studies have shown that HRT actually does more harm to your heart than good. If you’re taking HRT to help prevent heart disease, talk to your doctor about whether you should stop.

Your treatment will depend on what is causing your symptoms. If you have an acute case of angina (chest pain), your doctor will probably give you nitroglycerin and aspirin. Nitroglycerin improves blood flow to your heart. It can temporarily relieve your symptoms by widening the arteries that carry blood to the heart.

If you are having a heart attack, your doctor can:

• Give you medicine. The medicine is called a thrombolytic. It can help dissolve the blood clot that is blocking the coronary artery.
• Do a coronary angiography. (X-ray of the blood vessels).
• Do an angioplasty or stent. Angioplasty involves inserting a tiny balloon into an artery in your arm or leg. The balloon is threaded up the artery to the heart. The balloon pushes open blocked coronary arteries. A small metal rod called a stent might be put into the artery where the blockage was to hold the artery open.
• Do coronary artery bypass surgery. If an angioplasty and/or stenting are not appropriate, you may need this major surgery. Your doctor removes a healthy vein from your leg or an artery from your upper body. They make a bypass around the blockage in your coronary artery. This allows blood to flow around the blockage.

Treatment of heart attack also includes medicines that you will need to take even after you leave the hospital. These medicines help improve blood flow to your heart, prevent clotting, and reduce the risks of having another heart attack. These medicines include:

• Aspirin
• Beta blockers
• Statins
• ACE inhibitors
• Fish oil

Your doctor will prescribe the medicines that are right for you. If you have had a heart attack, your doctor will also talk to you about lifestyle changes. You can make these changes to prevent more heart problems.","After you’ve had a heart attack, you are at higher risk of having another one. Your doctor will likely recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help reduce your risk. They include:

• Maintaining a heart-healthy diet
• Working toward a healthy weight
• Managing your stress
• Being physically active
• Quitting smoking

Symptoms during a second heart attack may be different than the first one. If you have any new symptoms of heart attack or are in any doubt, call 911. Early treatment is the key to survival.","• Is there a test I can take to see if my arteries or blocked so I know if I’m at risk of a having a heart attack?
• What is the likely cause of my heart attack?
• How serious was my heart attack?
• What course of treatment do you recommend? Do I need medicine? Surgery?
• Do I need to participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program?
• When can I return to normal physical and sexual activity?
• What is my risk of having another heart attack?
• Are my family members at an increased risk of heart attack?
• Do I need to take medicine(s) to prevent another heart attack?
• Will the medicine(s) interact with any of the medicine(s) I already take?
• What lifestyle changes should I make at home to prevent another heart attack?
• Can sexual activity cause a heart attack?","Food and Drug Administration: Aspirin for Reducing Your Risk for Heart Attack and Stroke: Know the Facts

This can help reduce your risk of more heart problems. Your doctor can answer your questions about these medicines. They can tell you the benefits and risks of taking them.

• Aspirin can reduce the risk of another heart attack. For patients who have had a heart attack, a low dose of aspirin each day can keep your blood from forming clots that can eventually block the arteries. However, a daily dose of aspirin may not be right for everyone. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of aspirin therapy.
• Antiplatelet medicines also help stop blood clots from forming. These drugs are especially important to take for at least a year if you have had a stent placed in your heart.
• Beta blockers are a group of drugs that lower the heart rate and blood pressure. They help improve blood flow to the heart.
• ACE inhibitors are a group of drugs that can help if your heart is not pumping blood well. This medicine helps open your arteries and lower your blood pressure. This improves blood flow.
• Statins are a group of drugs that are used to control cholesterol. They lower “bad” cholesterol (LDL) levels and may help increase “good” cholesterol (HDL).

Depression is common after a heart attack. As many as 1 out of every 3 people who have had a heart attack report feelings of depression. People with a higher risk of depression after a heart attack include:

• Women
• People who have had depression before
• People who feel alone and without social or emotional support

Many people who have depression don’t recognize it. They don’t seek help or get treatment. Being depressed can make it harder for you to recover physically. Depression can be treated.

Some people have anxiety after a heart attack, fearing it will happen again. Talk to your doctor about your feelings so that you can manage or reduce your anxiety."
179,Heart Failure,https://familydoctor.org/condition/heart-failure/,The term “heart failure” sounds scary. But it simply means your heart isn’t pumping blood as well as it should. It can be caused by many different heart conditions and tends to get worse over time. It does not mean your heart has stopped working or that you are having a heart attack. The most common cause of heart failure is congestive heart failure (CHF). This means fluid is building up in the body because the heart isn’t pumping properly.,"Some people who have heart failure have few problems or symptoms. Others may have many symptoms, including:

• Shortness of breath during activity
• Shortness of breath when lying down
• Lack of appetite
• Waking up in the night, suddenly breathless
• General tiredness or weakness, including the reduced ability to exercise
• Swelling of the legs, feet, or ankles
• Swelling of the abdomen
• Rapid or irregular heartbeat
• Rapid weight gain (1 or 2 pounds a day for 3 days in a row)
• Chronic cough or wheezing
• Nausea

Call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms, especially if you’ve had heart problems in the past.

Heart failure has many causes. Most of these are other conditions or diseases that damage the heart muscle. These could include:

• Coronary artery disease (where there is narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels in the heart). This could be with or without a heart attack in the past
• Problems with the heart muscle itself (for example, cardiomyopathy).
• High blood pressure(hypertension)
• Problems with any of the heart valves
• Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
• The use of toxic substances (such as alcohol or drug abuse)
• Congenital heart defect (a heart problem you were born with)
• Diabetes
• Thyroid problems

Sometimes, the exact cause cannot be found. Some people are at higher risk of developing heart failure, including those who are:

• 65 years or older
• Black
• overweight
• Have had a heart attack in the past",null,"There is no single test to diagnose heart failure. Your doctor will ask you about your medical history and symptoms. He or she will give you a physical exam and may order some of the following tests:

• Blood tests measure the level of the BNP hormone that increases in heart failure.
• A chest X-ray shows if your heart is enlarged or your lungs have fluid in them.
• An electrocardiogram (also called an EKG or ECG) measures the rate and regularity of your heartbeat. It can help diagnose heart rhythm problems or damage to the heart.
• An echocardiogram (also called an echo) and doppler ultrasound use sound waves to make pictures of the heart. These show how well your heart is working and pumping blood.
• A Holter monitor is a small box attached to electrodes on your chest records your heart rhythm for 24 hours or more.
• A stress testmeasures your heartbeat and blood pressure. This can be done before, during, or after exercise to see how your heart responds to activity.
• Radionuclide ventriculography injects a very small amount of a radioactive substance into your blood. This substance travels to your heart. A special camera or scanner produces pictures that show how well your heart is pumping. The radioactive substance is safe and leaves your body completely after the test is finished.","Heart failure is the result of other diseases or conditions weakening your heart. These can include coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. The best way to avoid heart failure is to prevent those conditions. The following can help you maintain a healthy lifestyle:

• Quit smoking.
• Maintain a healthy weight.
• Exercise regularly.
• Eat a healthy diet.
• Limit alcohol.
• Limit sodium.

If you do have a condition such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, you need to manage it. Keep levels under control and take any medicines you’ve been prescribed.","Heart failure cannot be completely cured. But treatment can improve how well the heart pumps and can help relieve your symptoms. An important part of treatment is taking care of any underlying problems. This includes lowering high blood pressure or fixing a heart valve. Treatment also includes lifestyle changes and medicine.

A variety of medicines are used to treat heart failure. You may need one or more medicines, depending on your symptoms. Your doctor will talk about these medicines with you. It may take some time to find the best type of medicine and the best dosage of medicine for you.

Several kinds of medicines are commonly used to treat heart failure:

• ACE inhibitors help open (dilate) your arteries and lower your blood pressure, improving blood flow.
• Diuretics are often called “water pills.” They cause you to urinate more often and help keep fluid from building up in your body. They can also decrease fluid that collects in your lungs. This will help you breathe easier.
• Beta blockers can lower blood pressure and slow a rapid heartbeat. They may also help prevent some heart rhythm problems.
• Digoxin (also called digitalis) helps the heart pump better by strengthening the muscle contractions of the heart.

If you have other problems or experience side effects, you might need to take other medicines.

When you’re taking medicine for heart failure, you’ll also need to have regular blood tests. These will check your potassium level and kidney function. How often you need blood tests depends on the type and strength of medicine you’re taking. If you have concerns about the medicine or think you’re having side effects, talk to your doctor. It’s important that you take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you.

If your heart failure is severe, your doctor may recommend placing a small defibrillator in your chest. It can restart your heart if your heart stops.","Heart failure has no cure. You will have to follow a treatment plan for the rest of your life. This treatment plan can include medicines, lifestyle changes, guides on activity levels, and keeping your appointments. Your restrictions will depend on how severe your heart failure is.

The following tips can help you manage your heart failure at home.

• Follow a diet that’s healthy for your heart. Many doctors recommend the DASH diet. Avoid eating too much salt or too many salty foods (such as canned vegetables or soups, chips, or pizza). Salty and high-sodium foods can cause your body to retain water.
• Talk to your doctor before using salt substitutes. They often contain potassium and may not be good for your health. This will depend on your kidney function and what medicines you’re taking. Some people need extra potassium, but others don’t.
• Keep your blood pressure under control. High blood pressure strains your heart and further weakens it.
• Ask your doctor to recommend an exercise program for you. Try to reduce the stress in your life and get plenty of sleep. If you smoke, quit! If you’re overweight, talk to your doctor about how to lose weight safely.
• Talk to your doctor before you take any over-the-counter medicines. Common arthritis medicines such as naproxen (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil) can cause fluid retention.
• Weigh yourself daily at the same time of day. Report any unexplained changes to your doctor. Fluid retention and weight gain are signals that your CHF may not be in control.

Talk to your doctor if you have any of the following:

• Shortness of breath that gets worse
• A weight gain of more than 5 pounds in one week
• Leg swelling that is new for you
• Coughing or wheezing in the night or needing to sleep propped up or sitting up
• Chest pain or a heavy feeling in your chest
• Side effects from the medicine
• Failure to lose weight, even though you take more water pills

You should also call your doctor if you have any questions about your condition or medicine.","• What is the likely cause of my heart failure?
• How serious is my condition?
• How will my life change now that we know I have heart failure?
• How will I know if my condition is getting worse? When should I contact you or seek treatment?
• What is the best treatment option for me? Will I need medicine? Surgery?
• What are the side effects of the medicines used to treat heart failure?
• Will I need a heart transplant?

180,Heart Murmurs,https://familydoctor.org/condition/heart-murmurs/,"A heart murmur is an abnormal noise between heartbeats. It can be a blowing, whooshing, or swishing sound. When your doctor listens to your heartbeat with a stethoscope, they are listening to the sounds your blood makes as it flows through your heart. A heart murmur is when the blood makes an extra sound as it moves through. A heart murmur can be a sign of a heart problem. It can also be caused by a minor issue or a normal increase in blood flow in the heart.

An innocent heart murmur does not pose a health threat. If your child has an innocent heart murmur, they can run, jump, and play, with no limits on activity. Your child doesn’t need to take any medicine or be careful in any special way.","A heart murmur can be a symptom of another problem. The sound is the only way to know if you or your child has one. If a murmur is caused by a heart problem, you may have other symptoms. These could include:

• Shortness of breath
• Dizziness or fainting
• Bluish skin
• Chronic cough","Many different things can cause heart murmurs. In many cases, the heart murmur is just the sound of blood flowing through a normal, healthy heart. This is called an “innocent” or “functional” murmur. These noises are commonly heard in children because their hearts are very close to their chest walls. Many innocent murmurs become hard to hear as children grow older. Most go away on their own. Pregnant women also sometimes have innocent heart murmurs because the body makes extra blood during pregnancy.

Other heart murmurs are caused by problems with the heart. Heart problems that can cause a murmur include:

• Defects in the septum. The septum is the wall between the left and right chambers of the heart. Sometimes a hole in the septum can let blood flow through it. This blood flow causes a murmur.
• Abnormalities with valves. The valves in the heart let the blood flow from the upper chambers to the lower chambers. Sometimes there are problems with these valves. The valves could be too thick, too narrow, or too “floppy.” These problems can affect the flow of blood, which can cause a murmur.
• Disorders with the heart muscle. These problems (called cardiomyopathy) can make the muscle of the heart too thick or too weak. This affects the heart’s ability to pump blood and can cause extra noises.

You are at higher risk of developing a heart murmur if you have a family history of a heart defect or certain medical conditions. These could include high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, or endocarditis (infection in the lining of the heart).

Your baby is at higher risk of developing a heart murmur if you used certain medicines, alcohol, or drugs during pregnancy. Other pregnancy conditions can increase the risk, such as uncontrolled diabetes or a rubella infection.","Usually, your doctor will find a murmur during a regular exam when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. Once they hear the murmur, they will listen to the loudness, the location, and the timing of it. This will help them determine if it is an innocent murmur or if it could be something more serious.

If your doctor suspects a heart problem, they may refer you to a cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in the heart. Your doctor may choose to do some testing. These tests could include a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG), or an echocardiogram (sometimes called an “echo,” which is an ultrasound of the heart). These tests will help them see if there are problems with your heart rhythm, your heart structure, or how your heart is working.",There is nothing you can do to prevent heart murmurs caused by genetics. Avoiding drugs and alcohol and receiving treatment for infections during pregnancy can prevent some heart murmurs in children.,"The treatment for a heart murmur depends on what is causing the murmur. An innocent heart murmur doesn’t need any treatment. If a heart problem or other condition is causing the murmur, that problem will need to be treated. These types of conditions are usually treated with medicine. Severe cases could require surgery.","If you or your child has an innocent heart murmur, you can live a completely normal life. It will not cause you any problems and is not a sign of an issue with your heart. If you have a murmur along with any of the following symptoms, see your doctor:

• You are very tired
• You have trouble exercising or being physically active
• You have chest pain

If your child has a heart murmur and any of these symptoms, call your doctor:

• Rapid breathing
• Difficulty feeding
• Blue tint to the lips

These could be signs of a more serious heart problem.","• What kind of heart murmur do I or my child have?
• Is this kind of murmur indicative of other health problems?
• Do I or my child need tests or need to visit a cardiologist?
• What kind of treatment will I or my child need?
• Is it safe for my child to play and exercise like normal?","American Heart Association: Heart Murmurs

181,Heart Palpitations,https://familydoctor.org/condition/heart-palpitations/,"Heart palpitations are the sensation that your heart is pounding, racing, or skipping beats (fluttering). It is normal to hear or feel your heart “pounding” as it beats faster when you exercise. You may feel it when you do any physical activity. But if you have palpitations, you might feel like your heart is pounding while you are just sitting still or moving slowly.",Heart palpitations may feel different to different people. They may feel like your heart is skipping a beat. They may feel like a flutter in your chest. Or they may feel like the pounding described above. You may have heart palpitations while you are sitting or while you are lying down.,"Many things can cause heart palpitations. Some causes include:

• Heart-related causes. People who have an irregular heartbeat or arrhythmia may have palpitations. Most of the time, palpitations and irregular heartbeats are harmless. However, sometimes the break in your heart’s normal rhythm can be a serious problem. You also may have palpitations if you have problems with the valves in your heart. Valves help move blood through the heart.
• Non-heart-related causes. Certain medicines, herbal supplements, and illegal street drugs can make your heart beat faster. Medicines that can cause palpitations include asthma inhalers and decongestants. Caffeine (found in coffee, tea, and soda), alcohol, and tobacco can also cause palpitations. People who have panic disorder feel their heart pounding when they are fearful of something. They also feel it when they are having a panic attack. Some medical conditions, such as thyroid disease and anemia, also can cause palpitations.

Sometimes the cause of palpitations is unexplained. This happens in about 1 of every 7 people who have palpitations. Palpitations in these people usually are harmless.","If your heart races when you aren’t exercising, see your doctor. Your doctor will examine you and ask you about any medicines you are taking. They will ask about your diet and ask if you have panic attacks. Your doctor may want you to have a resting electrocardiogram test. This test tracks your heartbeat over a certain period of time. Your doctor also may test your blood.

If these tests do not show what is causing your palpitations, your doctor may have you wear a heart monitor. If so, you will wear it for 1 to 30 days. This monitor will show any breaks in your heart’s rhythm. Your doctor might refer you to a cardiologist (a heart doctor) for more tests or treatment.","Heart palpitations cannot always be prevented or avoided. Here are some things you can do that may help prevent or avoid them:

• Do not use illegal street drugs, such as cocaine.
• Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco.
• Tell your doctor what medicines and herbal supplements you take.
• Tell your doctor how much alcohol you drink and if you use anything else that might cause palpitations.
• Keep track of your palpitations. Write down the time that they happen and what you were doing when they began. Give this information to your doctor. They may be able to use this information to determine what is causing your heart palpitations.","Most of the time, heart palpitations are harmless and will go away on their own. In these cases, they do not require treatment.

However, heart palpitations can sometimes be a sign of a more serious heart condition. If you have palpitations and are also dizzy or have shortness of breath, seek immediate medical attention.

If your heart palpitations are related to a heart condition or other medical problem, your doctor will treat you for that. In these cases, your palpitations will likely go away as a result of treatment.

If your heart palpitations are a result of certain foods, beverages (alcohol and caffeine), or medications, try cutting back. Doing so could stop your palpitations.","If you can understand what is causing your palpitations, you will likely be able to manage them. You will be able to avoid known triggers, like diet pills, caffeine, and cold/cough medicines.

Palpitations that are caused by anxiety or stress are sometimes harder to control. The anxiety can cause the palpitations, and the palpitations can create anxiety. These often make up a seemingly endless cycle. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to ease your anxiety.","• What is the likely cause of my heart palpitations?
• Will I need to wear a heart monitor? For how long?
• Would it be helpful if I kept track of my palpitations? Do I need to track anything else, such as what I ate or my physical activity?
• Do my heart palpitations indicate a more serious problem?
• What are some symptoms that would indicate my condition is getting worse?
• Will I need to change my lifestyle, such as diet and exercise habits?","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Heart Palpitations

182,Heartburn,https://familydoctor.org/condition/heartburn/,"Despite its name, heartburn doesn’t affect the heart. Heartburn is a burning feeling in the lower chest, along with a sour or bitter taste in the throat and mouth. It usually occurs after eating a big meal or while lying down. The feeling can last for a few minutes or a few hours.",Heartburn symptoms vary. They may be slight or extreme. The severity of heartburn may depend on what—and how much—you have eaten. The main symptom of heartburn is a burning feeling in your throat and chest. This happens when the acidic liquid from your food or drink comes back up into your esophagus. You may have difficulty swallowing or choke on this acid. It may even make you hoarse or cough.,"When you eat, food passes from your mouth down a tube called the esophagus. The esophagus is about 10 inches long in most people. To enter the stomach, the food must pass through an opening between the esophagus and stomach. This opening acts like a gate to allow food to pass into the stomach. Usually, this opening closes as soon as food passes through. But if it doesn’t close all the way, acid from your stomach can get through the opening and into your esophagus. This is called reflux. Stomach acid can irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn.

Hiatal hernia also can cause heartburn. Hiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach is pushed up through the diaphragm (the muscle wall between the stomach and chest) and into the chest.","Heartburn symptoms are easy to recognize. If you think you may have this condition, talk with your doctor. They will likely be able to diagnose you based on your symptoms.","You might be able to avoid heartburn by making some lifestyle changes.

• Place 6- to 9-inch blocks under the legs at the head of your bed to raise it.
• Try to eat at least 2 to 3 hours before lying down. If you take naps, try sleeping in a chair.
• Quit smoking if you smoke.
• Try to lose weight if you’re overweight.
• Don’t overeat.
• Eat high-protein, low-fat meals.
• Avoid tight clothes and tight belts.
• Avoid foods and beverages that give you heartburn.","If taking over-the-counter antacid medicines and lifestyle changes don’t help your symptoms, talk with your doctor. They may want you to take prescription medicine. Or they may schedule you for some tests. Tests might include:

• pH test. This test checks for acid in the esophagus.
• Endoscopy. This procedure checks for other conditions. During it, your doctor looks into your stomach through a long, thin tube that is inserted down your esophagus. You are sedated for this procedure, so you don’t feel it. Your doctor may also check for Helicobacter pylori, bacteria that can cause ulcers.","Sometimes pain in the chest may be mistaken for heartburn when it’s really a sign of heart disease.

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","Many things can make heartburn worse. It is most common after overeating, when bending over or when lying down. Pregnancy, stress, and certain foods can also make symptoms worse.

Things that can make heartburn worse:

• Cigarette smoking
• Certain drinks, including coffee (both regular and decaffeinated), other drinks that contain caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks
• Citrus fruits
• Tomato products
• Chocolate, mints, or peppermints
• Fatty foods or spicy foods (such as pizza, chili, and curry)
• Lying down too soon after eating
• Being overweight or having obesity
• Certain medicines (such as sedatives and some medicines for high blood pressure)

Several kinds of medicine can be used to treat heartburn. Antacids neutralize the acid that your stomach makes. For most people, antacids that you can get over the counter (without a prescription) give fast, short-term relief. You may need to try different medicines to find one that works best for you. However, if you use antacids too much, they can cause diarrhea or constipation. Look for antacids that contain both magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide. One causes constipation while the other causes diarrhea. So they counteract each other.

Some brands of antacids include Maalox and Mylanta. Follow the directions on the package. H2 blockers (some brand names: Pepcid, Tagamet) reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes. Several are available without a prescription. Other medicines, such as omeprazole (brand name: Prilosec) and lansoprazole (brand name: Prevacid), also reduce how much acid the stomach makes. Metoclopramide (brand name: Reglan) reduces acid reflux. To find out what medicine is right for you, talk with your doctor.

If you have heartburn only now and then, it’s probably not serious. However, if you have heartburn frequently, it can lead to esophagitis (an inflamed lining of the esophagus). If esophagitis becomes severe, your esophagus might narrow. This can cause bleeding or trouble swallowing. If you get more than occasional heartburn, it may be a symptom of something more serious. It could mean that you have:

• Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
• An inflamed stomach lining (gastritis)
• Hiatal hernia
• Peptic ulcer"
183,Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke,https://familydoctor.org/condition/heat-exhaustion-heatstroke/,"Heat exhaustion happens when your body gets too hot. If you don’t treat heat exhaustion, it can lead to heatstroke. This occurs when your internal temperature reaches at least 104°F. Heatstroke is much more serious than heat exhaustion. It can cause shock, organ failure, or brain damage. In extreme cases, heatstroke can kill you.","Symptoms of heat exhaustion are:

• Muscle cramps
• Heavy sweating
• Pale or cold skin
• Weakness and/or confusion
• Dizziness
• Headache
• Nausea or vomiting
• Fast heartbeat
• Dark-colored urine, which indicates dehydration

In addition to these symptoms, warning signs of heatstroke also include:

• Fever of 104°F or higher
• Flushed or red skin
• Lack of sweating
• Trouble breathing
• Fainting
• Seizures","Heat-related illnesses occur when your body can’t keep itself cool. As the temperature rises, your body produces sweat to stay cool. On hot, humid days, the increased moisture in the air slows down this process. When your body can’t cool, your temperature rises and you can become ill.

Hot weather and exercise are the main causes of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. In hot settings, you need to be mindful of the temperature outside. The heat index is not the same as the temperature. It measures the air temperature plus the effects of humidity. A heat index of 90°F or higher calls for extreme caution. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures increases your risk of heat-related illnesses.","If a person is displaying known heat illness symptoms, take their temperature. A reading of 104°F or more means they probably have heatstroke. You should call 911 and get medical care right away.","There are many things you can do to prevent heat-related illnesses. Babies, children, and elderly people are more sensitive to heat and require extra attention. You also are at greater risk if you are ill or have obesity or heart disease. People who work outside or in a hot setting also are at risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke.

Don’t go outside when the temperature and heat index are high. If possible, stay indoors in air-conditioned areas. If you must go outside, take the following precautions.

• Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing.
• Protect yourself from the sun by wearing a hat or using an umbrella.
• Use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher.
• Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration and lack of salt contribute to heat-related illnesses. Some sports drinks can help replenish the salt in your body lost through sweating. Drink water or other fluids every 15 to 20 minutes, even if you don’t feel thirsty. If your urine is clear, you are probably drinking enough fluids. Dark-colored urine is a sign that you’re dehydrated.
• Avoid or limit drinks that contain caffeine (such as tea, coffee, and soda) or alcohol.
• Schedule outdoor activities for cooler times of the day — before 10 a.m. and after 6 p.m.
• Take frequent breaks from the heat and outdoor activities.
• Do not stay or leave a child in your car when it is hot outside. Even if you open the windows, the intense heat can be extremely dangerous.

Certain medicines can put you in danger of heatstroke. They affect the way your body reacts to heat. Talk to your doctor if you take any of these or have an ongoing health problem. They can help you manage the heat with your condition. These medicines include:

• Antibiotics
• Allergy medicines (antihistamines)
• Some medicines used to manage blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart disease (beta-blockers and vasoconstrictors)
• Some medicines that treat mental health problems (antidepressants and antipsychotics)
• Seizure medicines (anticonvulsants)
• Water pills (diuretics)
• Laxatives
• Some diet pills
• Prescription acne medicines
• Illegal drugs, such as cocaine (amphetamines)","If you or someone else has heat exhaustion, treat symptoms in the following ways.

• Get out of the heat quickly and into a cool place, or at least shade.
• Lie down and elevate your legs to get blood flowing to your heart.
• Take off any tight or extra clothing.
• Apply cool towels to your skin or take a cool bath. This will help regulate and lower your internal body temperature.
• Drink fluids, such as water or a sports drink. Do not guzzle them, but take sips. Do not drink fluids with caffeine or alcohol.

• Symptoms don’t improve or they still have a fever of 102°F after 30 minutes of initial treatment.
• The person goes into shock, faints, or has seizures.
• The person is not breathing. You also should begin CPR right away to try and revive them.","After you’ve had heat exhaustion or heatstroke, you will be sensitive to heat. This can last for about a week. It’s important to rest and let your body recover. Avoid hot weather and exercise. Ask your doctor when it’s safe to return to your normal activities.","• What are the warning signs of heat exhaustion and how can I prevent it from worsening?
• What are heat cramps and who can get them?
• What is heat rash and is it dangerous?
• What should I do if I’m taking medicine that makes me sensitive to heat?
• How much water should I drink when it’s hot outside?
• What should I do if I work in a hot environment?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Heat Emergencies

184,Heat Rash,https://familydoctor.org/condition/heat-rash/,"Heat rash is a skin irritation that stings and makes your skin red. It is also called miliaria or prickly heat. If you have this condition, your skin may feel itchy. Small bumps may form, and you may feel some “prickly,” tingling pain.

The rash occurs most often in hot, humid weather. Anyone can get it, and it is most common in infants and young children.","Heat rash usually looks like a cluster of pimples or small blisters. It is most likely to appear in places where skin touches skin, including:

• Groin
• Underneath the breasts
• In the creases of the elbows
• Armpits","Heat rash happens when you sweat too much. The sweat gets trapped under your skin and blocks your sweat glands. If your pores cannot clear out the sweat, you may get a rash.

Heat rash often happens when it is hot and humid outside. Having a high body temperature, being overdressed, or being in a hot environment can also cause it. Babies who are bundled in too much clothing are most likely to get heat rash. People who are not used to hot weather may also get it more easily.","There are no tests for heat rash. Your doctor can diagnose it just by looking at it. But most cases don’t need to be seen by a doctor. They go away by themselves. If your rash doesn’t go away after 3 or 4 days, or if it seems to be getting worse, call your doctor. In some cases, the rash may be caused by an infection.

See your doctor if your itchiness is severe or if the rash area swells or oozes pus. If you feel dizzy, nauseated, confused, or you have trouble breathing, go to the emergency room right away. These symptoms can be signs of serious heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion or heatstroke.","In many cases, heat rash can be avoided. In hot weather, dress yourself or your child in lightweight cotton clothing. Cotton helps absorb moisture to keep it off of your skin. If the weather is hot, turn on the air conditioner, or use a fan to help you stay cool and dry.","The most effective treatment for heat rash is to keep your skin cool and dry.

• Cool down. Avoid hot and humid places. If possible, stay in air-conditioned areas, or use fans to circulate the air. Use cool compresses to bring down the temperature of the affected skin.
• Dry off. Keep the irritated skin dry. Use a fan to dry the skin off faster and to reduce sweating.
• Reduce friction. Wear loose clothes to prevent irritation caused by clothing that rubs against the skin.

If your rash is severe, your doctor may prescribe a lotion to help relieve your pain or discomfort. Avoid using baby powders, ointments and creams at home. They can block pores even more.","Whether you are trying to treat heat rash or prevent it, the best way to live with it is to keep the skin cool and dry. Avoid overdressing and tight-fitting clothes. Try to stay out of hot, humid conditions. Keep your sleeping area cool and allow air to circulate.","• What caused my rash?
• Is there a treatment that will help?
• What can I do at home to make myself more comfortable?

185,HELLP Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hellp-syndrome/,"HELLP syndrome is a rare but serious illness during pregnancy. It is a version of preeclampsia, another pregnancy condition that causes high blood pressure. It causes blood and liver problems in the mother. HELLP stands for the 3 indicators of the syndrome:

• Hemolysis – This is a breakdown of red blood cells. These carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
• Elevated Liver enzyme levels – High levels can mean there are liver problems.
• Low Platelet counts – Platelets help the blood clot.

This illness can start quickly. It most often occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy (the third trimester). It can also start soon after you have your baby. Women who have HELLP syndrome may have bleeding problems, liver problems, and blood pressure problems. Any of these can hurt both the mother and the baby.","The symptoms of HELLP syndrome include:

• Feeling tired
• Pain in the upper right part of your belly
• Bad headaches
• Nausea or vomiting
• Swelling, especially in your face and hands
• Blurry vision
• Fluid retention and weight gain
• High blood pressure

Rarely, you may notice bleeding that doesn’t stop easily, including from your nose, gums, or other places. Seizures or convulsions can happen but are also rare.

Many healthy pregnant women also have some of these symptoms late in pregnancy. It may be hard to know for sure if you have HELLP syndrome. Call your doctor right away if you’re experiencing these symptoms.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes HELLP syndrome. They also can’t predict who will get it. Any pregnant woman may get this illness.

Most women who will get sick have high blood pressure or preeclampsia before they get HELLP syndrome. You can get HELLP syndrome even if your blood pressure is normal.

You’re more likely to get HELLP syndrome if you’re white and older than 34 years of age. You are at higher risk if you’ve had children before or if you had a problem with a past pregnancy.","Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will check for tenderness in your abdomen, especially the upper right side. They will check for an enlarged liver, swollen legs, and high blood pressure. These are all signs that you could have HELLP syndrome.

Your doctor will likely order blood tests. These will show if your liver enzymes are high or your blood platelet count is low. These are common indicators of HELLP syndrome.","There is no way to prevent this illness. The best thing you can do is see your doctor regularly. Tell them about any symptoms you are having at every prenatal visit.

If you have HELLP syndrome during one pregnancy, you are more likely have it again during your next pregnancy. The illness is usually less severe the second time. You are also more likely to have HELLP syndrome if you had preeclampsia during a previous pregnancy.","The main treatment for HELLP is to deliver your baby as soon as possible. This may have to be done before your due date. This means your baby may be born prematurely.

Complications from HELLP can develop quickly, putting both you and your baby in danger. If you aren’t too sick, your doctor may wait a few days before delivering your baby. They can give you corticosteroid medicines. This will help the baby’s lungs develop faster before it is born. Other treatments you may receive in the hospital include:

• A blood transfusion if you have severe bleeding
• High blood pressure medicines
• An infusion of magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures

Some women who have HELLP syndrome get very sick. Rarely, the illness can be fatal. Most women who have this illness start to get better a couple of days after their babies are born.","If you are diagnosed early, you will likely be fine. Without early treatment, you may develop complications. These include:

• Clotting problems that can lead to hemorrhage (excessive bleeding)
• Fluid in your lungs
• Kidney failure
• Liver hemorrhage and failure
• Placental abruption (when the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus)

Once your baby is born, the illness usually goes away. If you have it once, you are more likely to have it again in future pregnancies.","• I have high blood pressure. Am I at risk for HELLP syndrome?
• What blood tests do I need?
• Will I need to deliver my baby early? What risks does this pose for my baby’s health?
• What would happen if I waited to deliver my baby?
• I had HELLP syndrome during another pregnancy. Will I have it again? Can I do anything to prevent HELLP syndrome during this pregnancy?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: HELLP syndrome

186,Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition involving red blood cells and your kidneys. HUS happens after you get an infection in your digestive system. The infection makes toxins that destroy red blood cells. These damaged cells block the kidneys’ filtering system and can cause your kidneys to fail.

For you to be diagnosed with HUS, the infection must cause 3 problems:

• Hemolytic anemia(not enough red blood cells)
• Thrombocytopenia (not enough platelets)
• Renal (kidney) failure

Most cases of HUS happen after someone has become infected with E. coli bacteria. E. coli is a common bacterium that people normally have in their digestive tract. But certain strains produce the toxins that destroy the red blood cells and damage your kidneys.

Anyone can get HUS, but it is more common in children and older adults. Many people who get an E. coli infection do not develop HUS.","The first symptoms of HUS are vomiting and diarrhea. The diarrhea might have blood in it. Around 5 to 10 days after the diarrhea starts, you or your child might develop signs of anemia. Anemia happens when you don’t have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your cells. Symptoms include:

• Bloody diarrhea
• Weakness and lethargy
• Irritability
• Fever

Later, more symptoms may appear, such as:

• Pale skin
• Unexplained bruising or bleeding
• Swelling of the face, hands, feet, or any other part of the body
• Decreased urination
• No urination
• Seizures (these are rare)

Call your doctor right away if you or your child have bloody diarrhea plus decreased urine output, unexplained bruises, unusual bleeding, or extreme fatigue.","Most cases of HUS occur after an E. coli infection. You can catch an E. coli infection by:

• Eating undercooked ground beef (for example, if the inside of a hamburger that you have eaten was very pink)
• Drinking contaminated (impure) water
• Drinking unpasteurized (raw) milk
• Eating unwashed, contaminated raw vegetable and fruits
• Working with cattle

Healthy beef and dairy cattle may carry E. coli in their intestines. When the animals are slaughtered and the meat is ground, the E. coli bacteria can mix into the meat. Cooking the meat usually kills the bacteria.

The most common cause of an E. coli infection is from eating undercooked ground beef. You can be infected with E. coli if you don’t use a high enough temperature to cook your beef, or if you don’t cook it long enough. When you eat undercooked beef, the bacteria go into your stomach and intestines.

Ponds and lakes can become contaminated with E. coli. If you come into contact with this water, you can get E. coli. Sometimes water that has the bacteria is accidentally used to irrigate crops. This can contaminate fruits and vegetables.

The bacteria can also pass from person to person in day care centers and nursing homes. If you have this infection, you should wash your hands well with soap after going to the bathroom. If you don’t, you can give the bacteria to other people when you touch things, especially food.

Other less common causes of HUS include the use of certain medicines, certain infections, and pregnancy.","Your doctor will perform a physical exam. They will order lab work, including blood and urine tests. These tests will look for signs of anemia and kidney failure. More advanced tests include a stool culture or a kidney biopsy.","If you or your child are infected with E. coli, there’s nothing you can do to prevent it from developing into HUS. The key is to avoid the E. coli infection. To lower your risk of being infected with E. coli, follow these rules:

• Wash your hands carefully with soap before you start cooking.
• Cook ground beef until you see no pink in the meat.
• Don’t taste small bites of raw ground beef while you’re cooking.
• Don’t put cooked hamburgers on a plate that had raw ground beef on it.
• Cook all hamburgers to at least 160°F. A meat thermometer can help you test your hamburgers.
• In restaurants, always order your hamburgers and steaks well done so that no pink shows.
• Defrost meats in the refrigerator or the microwave. Don’t put meat on the counter at room temperature to defrost.
• Keep raw meat and poultry separate from other foods. Use hot water and soap to wash cutting boards and dishes after raw meat and poultry have touched them.
• Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water before eating them.
• Drink only clean water.
• Don’t drink raw milk.
• Refrigerate leftovers right away or throw them away.
• People with diarrhea should wash their hands with hot water and soap often, and for at least 30 seconds.
• People who work in day care centers and homes for the elderly should wash their hands often.
• Don’t swim in dirty lakes or rivers. Don’t swim if you have diarrhea.
• Wash your hands well after petting farm animals.

Those at highest risk of developing HUS are children under 5 and adults over 75.","Most people who become infected with E. coli won’t get HUS. If you or your child do, you will need to go to the hospital. Your doctor will want to watch your kidney function and make sure you keep enough fluids in your body.

Some of the treatment you or your child might need include:

• Red blood cell transfusions to reverse symptoms
• Platelet transfusions to help the blood clot more normally
• Medicines
• Hydration with fluids and electrolytes
• Dialysis to help failing kidneys. During dialysis, a machine is used to filter waste products from the blood. Dialysis is only needed in the most severe cases of HUS. It is usually temporary. But people with severe kidney damage could need it long-term.","Most people who are diagnosed with HUS make a full recovery. But it’s a serious illness. If you or your child have significant damage to your kidneys, you may need regular transfusions or dialysis. Left untreated, HUS can cause death. Children with HUS tend to have better outcomes than adults.","• How did I get an E. coli infection?
• Are there any medicines I can take?
• Will I need dialysis?
• Should I have my family tested for E. coli?
• Will there be any permanent damage to my kidneys?
• What changes should I make to my diet?
• I work at a day care center. Should I let the parents know that I have an E. coli infection?
• Should I stop eating ground beef?
• How often should I wash my hands?","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome in Children

187,Hemorrhoids,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hemorrhoids/,"Hemorrhoids are swollen or inflamed veins in your rectum or around your anus. They are very common, especially in people who are pregnant. The type of hemorrhoid you have depends on where it occurs.

• Internal: involve the veins inside the anus at the rectum. They usually don’t hurt but may bleed during a bowel movement.
• Prolapsed: often stretch down until they swell outside the anus. It may shrink back inside the rectum on its own, or you can gently push it back inside.
• External: involve the veins outside the anus. They can be itchy or tender and can sometimes crack and bleed. A blood clot may form which can be painful and uncomfortable.","If you have a hemorrhoid, you may feel a tender lump on the edge of your anus. You may also see blood in the toilet or on toilet paper after a bowel movement. You may feel pain or itchiness in that area. Pain is most likely to occur with bowel movements (especially hard stools) or strenuous activities, like lifting something heavy.","Hemorrhoids are caused by increased pressure in the veins of your anus or rectum. One of the main causes is straining when you’re trying to have a bowel movement. This may happen if you’re constipated or have diarrhea. It may also happen if you sit on the toilet too long. Hemorrhoids are also caused by obesity, heavy lifting, or any other activity that causes you to strain.","It’s often possible to identify hemorrhoids if you feel or see a lump, especially if outside the anus. A doctor can perform a rectal exam to confirm internal hemorrhoids. They will use a gloved, lubricated finger to feel in and around your rectum. An additional procedure may be needed for a better evaluation. During a sigmoidoscopy, the doctor will insert a small camera to look inside your rectum. During an anoscopy, a small instrument called an anoscope is inserted a few inches into the anus to examine the anal canal.

It’s important to see your doctor if you notice bleeding from your rectum. You need to make sure the cause is hemorrhoids and not some other problem. Bleeding from your rectum or anus or bloody stools may be a sign of something more serious such as cancer.","Hemorrhoids are a common problem, but not always preventable. People whose parents had hemorrhoids may be more likely to get them. Pregnant women often get them because of the strain from carrying the baby and giving birth. Being overweight or standing or lifting too much can make hemorrhoids worse.","Most of the time, symptoms go away on their own after a few days. If not, treatments at home focus on relieving the pain. Talk to your doctor before using hemorrhoid medicine.

Here are some things you can do to help ease your symptoms:

• Take a bath in warm water.
• Clean your anus gently after each bowel movement. Do this by patting gently with moist toilet paper or moistened pads, such as baby wipes.
• Use cold or ice packs to relieve swelling.
• Use acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol), ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin), or aspirin (brand name: Aleve) to help relieve pain.
• Apply a cream that contains witch hazel or a numbing ointment that contains lidocaine to the area. You can also use creams that contain hydrocortisone for itching or pain.

Painful hemorrhoids usually stop hurting in 1 to 2 weeks. Talk to your doctor if the pain continues or if the hemorrhoids persist. Rubber band ligation can be used to treat internal hemorrhoids. It involves placing a small rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid. This stops the flow of blood to the area and the hemorrhoid fades away. Internal hemorrhoids can be destroyed by injecting them with a chemical. You may need a hemorrhoidectomy (surgical removal of the hemorrhoid) if internal hemorrhoids are prolapsed or very large.","Hemorrhoid symptoms may come and go. Many things can affect them, especially straining to have a bowel movement. Use these tips to help prevent constipation:

• Add fiber to your diet. Fresh fruits, leafy vegetables, and whole-grain breads and cereals are good sources of fiber.
• Drink plenty of fluids (except alcohol). Eight glasses of water a day is ideal.
• Exercise regularly, but do not strain with activity.
• Avoid laxatives, except bulk-forming laxatives such as Fiberall, Metamucil, etc. Other types of laxatives can lead to diarrhea, which can worsen hemorrhoids.
• When you feel the need to have a bowel movement, don’t wait too long to use the bathroom.","• Why do I have hemorrhoids? Will I always have them?
• I saw blood on toilet paper. Is this serious?
• Are having hemorrhoids a sign of another health condition?
• Is there medicine I can take for hemorrhoids? Are there side effects?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I can do to relieve or prevent hemorrhoids?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hemorrhoids

188,Henoch-Schönlein Purpura,https://familydoctor.org/condition/henoch-schonlein-purpura/,"Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a rare disease that causes the blood vessels in your skin to become irritated and swollen. This inflammation is called vasculitis. When the blood vessels bleed, you get a rash called purpura. HSP can affect blood vessels in the bowel and the kidneys as well.","HSP causes a skin rash called purpura. It looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots. The rash can occur on your buttocks, around your elbows, or on your legs and feet. In addition to the rash, HSP can cause:

• Purple spots on the skin
• Joint pain
• Stomach pain
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Headache
• Bloody diarrhea
• Abnormal urine
• Swelling and pain in the scrotum of boys

Possible complications include:

• Internal bleeding
• Intestinal blockage
• Kidney problems

HSP symptoms usually last about 4 to 6 weeks. If the blood vessels in your bowel and the kidneys get inflamed, you may bleed when you have a bowel movement or urinate. Serious kidney problems do not happen often but can occur. If you or your child has symptoms of HSP, see your doctor. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of your bowel called intussusception can occur. This creates a blockage in your intestines that may need surgery.","The exact cause of HSP is unknown. Experts believe a person’s body develops excessive inflammation directed at certain blood vessels in the body. It could be triggered by a bacterial or viral infection, such as an upper respiratory infection. Allergic reactions to medicines, vaccinations, food, or insect bites could cause it. Exposure to chemicals or cold weather is another possible trigger. You may catch an infection from someone that caused HSP, but HSP itself isn’t contagious.",Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. HSP can be diagnosed if you have two or more symptoms. The doctor may do a skin biopsy and/or blood and urine test. They also can do additional tests to rule out other conditions.,"Doctors do not know how to prevent HSP. The disease is more common in boys than in girls. Children 2 to 11 years of age are more likely to be affected, but adults can get it too.","There is no specific treatment for HSP. Your doctor can prescribe medicine to help you feel better. Antibiotics can treat a bacterial infection that may have triggered the disease. HSP often goes away without treatment. Anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen help with swelling and joint pain. Steroids, such as prednisone, can help treat severe joint and stomach pain.","Usually, HSP does not cause lasting problems and gets better on its own. About half of people who have HSP once will get it again. In serious cases, long-term kidney damage is possible. Your doctor may want to do routine urine samples to check for kidney problems. Be sure to see your doctor regularly during this time.","• What is the likely cause of HSP?

189,Hepatitis A,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hepatitis-a/,"Hepatitis is a general term for inflammation of the liver. Normally, the liver breaks down waste products in your blood. But when the liver is inflamed, it doesn’t do a good job of getting rid of waste products. This causes waste products to build up in your blood and tissues.

Many different things can cause hepatitis. The most common cause of hepatitis is infection with one of the 5 hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, or E). Lack of blood supply to the liver, poison, autoimmune disorders, excessive alcohol use, liver injury, and taking certain medicines can also cause hepatitis. Less commonly, viral infections such as mononucleosis or cytomegalovirus can cause hepatitis.

There are 2 main kinds of hepatitis: acute hepatitis and chronic hepatitis. Most people get over the acute hepatitis in a few days or weeks. Sometimes, however, the inflammation doesn’t go away. When the inflammation doesn’t go away in 6 months, the person has chronic hepatitis.

Hepatitis A (Hep A) is liver inflammation caused by the hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A is different from other types of hepatitis. It isn’t typically as serious as hepatitis B or C, and it doesn’t usually develop into chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis (late-stage scarring of the liver).

Hepatitis A is very contagious. This means that you can easily catch the virus from someone or give it to someone else. You are most contagious soon after you are infected and before symptoms appear. Adults who are otherwise healthy are no longer contagious 2 weeks after the illness begins. Children and people who have a weak immune system may be contagious for up to 6 months.","The hepatitis A virus is usually in your system for 2 to 6 weeks before symptoms appear. Some people never have symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they can appear suddenly and may include:

• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Jaundice (the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes)
• Low-grade fever (fever up to 102°F)
• Fatigue
• Pain in your abdomen, especially on your right side
• Dark-colored urine
• Loss of appetite
• Muscle pain

Young children are likely to have mild cases of hepatitis A, while symptoms in older children and adults are more likely to be severe.","Hepatitis A is caused by infection with the hepatitis A virus. You get the virus when you unknowingly eat a small amount of infected feces. This can happen through person-to-person contact, or through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

A person can have and spread hepatitis A, even if that person does not have any symptoms. You are most likely to get hepatitis A from another person when:

• A person who has the virus does not wash their hands properly after going to the bathroom
• A parent does not wash their hands properly after changing the diaper of an infected child
• A caregiver does not wash their hands properly after cleaning up the stool of an infected person
• A person has sex with a person who has the virus

You can also get infected with hepatitis A by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. Contaminated food and water are more common in developing countries. When traveling in areas where hepatitis A is common, avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables, shellfish, ice, and untreated water.",See your doctor if you have any of the symptoms of hepatitis A. They can do a blood test to see if you have the disease.,"The best way to protect yourself against hepatitis A is to get the vaccine. The hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for all children older than age 1. It begins to protect you only 4 weeks after you are vaccinated. A 6- to 12-month booster is required for long-term protection. Ask your doctor if the vaccination is right for you.

You should also wash your hands with soap and warm water before and after cooking, after using the bathroom, and after changing diapers.

Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating and avoid raw or undercooked meat and fish.

You are at higher risk for hepatitis A if you:

• Live with or have sex with someone who has hepatitis A
• Travel to countries where hepatitis A is common
• Are a man who has sex with other men
• Use illegal drugs
• Have a clotting-factor disorder (such as hemophilia)","There is no specific medicine to treat or cure hepatitis A. If you have the virus, your body will eventually get rid of the infection on its own. You probably will feel sick for a few months before you begin to feel better.

To help your liver heal, you should get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol and acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol). Talk with your doctor before you take any prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements. Alcohol, acetaminophen, and certain other medicines, vitamins, and supplements can cause more damage to your liver.

You may need to stay in the hospital for a short time if you get dehydrated, have severe pain, suddenly become confused, or develop bleeding problems.","Once you recover from hepatitis A, you develop antibodies that protect you from the virus for life, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","• Do I need treatment?

190,Hepatitis B,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hepatitis-b/,"Hepatitis is a general term for inflammation of the liver. Normally, the liver breaks down waste products in your blood. But when the liver is inflamed, it doesn’t do a good job of getting rid of waste products. This causes waste products to build up in your blood and tissues.

Many different things can cause hepatitis. The most common cause of hepatitis is infection with one of the 5 hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, or E). Other potential causes are:

• Lack of blood supply to the liver.
• Poison.
• Autoimmune disorders.
• Excessive alcohol use.
• An injury to the liver.
• Taking certain medications.
• Viral infections, such as mononucleosisor cytomegalovirus, although this is less common.

There are 2 main kinds of hepatitis: acute hepatitis (short-lived) and chronic hepatitis (lasting at least 6 months). Most people get over the acute inflammation in a few days or a few weeks. Sometimes, however, the inflammation doesn’t go away. When the inflammation doesn’t go away in 6 months, the person has chronic hepatitis.

Hepatitis B (also called Hep B) is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. The virus is usually spread from person to person through contact with blood and/or body fluids of someone who has the infection.","Symptoms of hepatitis B can range from mild to severe. If you have a mild case of hepatitis, you may not even realize that you have it. It may not cause any symptoms, or may only cause symptoms similar to the stomach flu. The symptoms of hepatitis B may include:

• Loss of appetite
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Weakness and fatigue
• Abdominal pain (especially in the area around your liver)
• Dark-colored urine
• Jaundice (the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes)
• Joint pain","Hepatitis B is caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus. You can get the virus if you have unprotected sexual contact with an infected partner. People who use intravenous (IV) drugs can get hepatitis B when they share needles with someone who has the virus. Health care workers (such as nurses, lab technicians, and doctors) can get hepatitis B if they are accidentally stuck with a needle that was used on an infected patient. The infection can also be passed from a mother to her baby during childbirth. You are also more likely to get hepatitis B if you travel to areas of the world where hepatitis B is common.

Hepatitis B cannot be transmitted through casual contact. For example, you cannot get hepatitis B by hugging or shaking hands with someone who is infected.","Blood tests are used to diagnose hepatitis B. Blood tests can tell your doctor whether your liver is working properly, and they can also be used to monitor your condition during treatment.

Your doctor may want to look at your liver with an ultrasound exam or X-rays. You may also need a liver biopsy. During a liver biopsy, a small piece of the liver is removed and looked at under a microscope. A liver biopsy can help your doctor diagnose your illness and see the condition of your liver directly.","The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to always have protected sex (use a condom) and, if you use intravenous (IV) drugs, avoid sharing needles.

A vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis B. The CDC recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for:

• All infants.
• All children and adolescents younger than 19 who have not been vaccinated.
• Adults 19–59.
• Adults 60 and older with risk factors for hepatitis B

The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and administered in either a two-dose or three-dose series, depending on the brand. The three-dose series is given over six months, while the two-dose version is spaced about one month apart. To ensure full protection, it is essential to complete the entire series.

This vaccine should be given to people who are at high risk for this illness, such as healthcare workers, all children, people who travel to areas where the infection is widespread, drug users, and those who have multiple sex partners.","If you have acute (short-lived) hepatitis B, your body may be able to fight the infection on its own. This means you might not need treatment. Your doctor will help you manage your symptoms and monitor your condition while your body works to clear the hepatitis B from your system.

If you have chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis B, your family doctor will probably refer you to a gastroenterologist or other subspecialist who treats people who have chronic liver problems. There are a number of medical treatments available that are often successful. These include treatment with antiviral medicines.

Treatment may take a year or more, depending on the severity of the infection and the response to treatment.","Risk of chronic infection caused by hepatitis B is related to your age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC). “Approximately 90% of infected infants become chronically infected compared with 2%-6% of adult,” reports the CDC.

Chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to serious health issues. If you have it, you should be monitored regularly by a doctor. This means you should check in with your doctor at least once or twice a year. Some people who have chronic hepatitis B infection require medicine, but others do not. Your doctor can discuss treatment options with you.

If you have chronic hepatitis B infection, it will likely stay in your blood and liver for a lifetime, according to The Hepatitis B Foundation. This means that you could pass the virus to others, even if you don’t feel sick.

“The most important thing to remember is that hepatitis B is a chronic medical condition (such as diabetes and high blood pressure) that can be successfully managed if you take good care of your health and your liver,” reports the Hepatitis B Foundation. “You should expect to live a long, full life.”","• How did I get hepatitis B?

Cirrhosis occurs when the liver cells die and are replaced by scar tissue and fat. The damaged areas of the liver stop working and can’t cleanse the body of wastes. Cirrhosis can lead to liver failure and even liver cancer.

If you have hepatitis B, you are also susceptible to hepatitis D (also called delta virus). Hepatitis D can only develop in people who already have hepatitis B. It can make your symptoms of hepatitis B or liver disease worse. It is spread through contact with infected blood or other body fluids of people who have hepatitis D."
191,Hepatitis C,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hepatitis-c/,"Hepatitis is a general term for inflammation of the liver. Normally, the liver breaks down waste products in your blood. But when the liver is inflamed, it doesn’t do a good job of getting rid of waste products. This causes waste products to build up in your blood and tissues.

Many different things can cause hepatitis. The most common cause of hepatitis is infection with one of the 5 hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, or E). Other things that can cause hepatitis include:

Sometimes, however, the inflammation doesn’t go away. When the inflammation doesn’t go away in 6 months, the person has chronic hepatitis.

Hepatitis C is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus. It is spread from person to person through contact with blood. Most people who are infected with hepatitis C don’t experience any symptoms for years. However, hepatitis C usually is a chronic illness (which means it doesn’t go away on its own). If you have hepatitis C, you need to be watched carefully by a doctor because it can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. Cirrhosis from hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver failure and needing a liver transplant.

Common side effects for some treatments for hepatitis C may include the following:

• nausea
• vomiting
• fever
• fatigue
• depression

Side effects are usually worst during the first few weeks of treatment. They become less severe over time. If you are having trouble dealing with the side effects of your medicine, talk to your doctor. He or she can suggest ways to relieve some of the side effects. For example, if your medicine makes you feel nauseated, it may help to take it right before you go to sleep.","Many people don’t feel sick or have symptoms of hepatitis C until they’ve had the virus for a long time. Some people have mild, flu-like symptoms anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months after they are first infected with the virus. These symptoms may include:

• Mild fatigue.
• Achiness in your joints and muscles.
• Nausea.
• Lack of appetite.
• Tenderness in the area of your liver (the right upper part of your abdomen).

As the disease progresses, hepatitis C can cause liver damage. In many cases, there are no symptoms until liver problems develop. If symptoms of liver problems do appear, they may include:

• fatigue
• nausea
• vomiting
• loss of appetite
• jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes)
• low-grade fever (fever up to 102°F)","Hepatitis C is caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus. The virus is spread from person to person through contact with blood. People who use intravenous (IV) drugs can get hepatitis C when they share needles with someone who has the virus. Health care workers (such as nurses, lab technicians, and doctors) can be exposed to hepatitis C. They can become infected if they are accidentally stuck with a needle that was used on an infected patient. You are also at a higher risk if you got a blood transfusion or an organ transplant before 1992. (Improvements in blood-screening technology were made in 1992.)

Hepatitis C can’t be spread unless a person has direct contact with infected blood. This means a person who has hepatitis C cannot pass the virus to others through casual contact such as:

• sneezing
• coughing
• shaking hands
• hugging
• kissing
• sharing eating utensils or drinking glasses
• swimming in a pool
• using public toilets
• touching doorknobs","Your doctor will determine if you have hepatitis C by using a blood test. The test is called the Hepatitis C Antibody Test. The test checks your blood for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus. If antibodies are detected, it means you have been exposed to hepatitis C. If your viral load is positive, it means you are currently actively infected with hepatitis C. A negative test means that you do not have hepatitis C antibodies and likely do not have hepatitis C.","The only way to prevent hepatitis C is to avoid coming in contact with an infected person’s blood. Always have protected sex (use a condom). Don’t do intravenous (IV) drugs. Don’t share personal care items (such as razors or toothbrushes) with a person who has hepatitis C. If you’re a health care worker, follow your workplace’s standard safety practices.","Hepatitis C is usually spread through direct contact with the blood of a person who has the disease. It can also be transmitted by needles used for tattooing or body piercing. In rare cases, hepatitis C can be passed from a mother to her unborn baby. This virus can be transmitted through sex and sharing razors or toothbrushes. These occurrences are also rare. Many times, the cause of hepatitis C is never found.

Treatment of hepatitis C has improved over the years. Newer medicines have shorter treatment cycles and fewer side effects. Some of these treatments have the potential to even cure the disease.

Most recently, the Food & Drug Administration approved a pill that is a combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (brand name: Mavyret). It has one of the shortest treatment cycles. Treatment dosage and length of treatment cycle depends on stage of disease. The shortest treatment cycle (8 weeks) is for people who have hepatitis C but have not been treated for it and do not have cirrhosis of the liver. It can treat all types of hepatitis C.

There are a number of other medications approved for treatment of hepatitis C. Talk to your doctor to determine which is best for you.

Your treatment plan for hepatitis C will depend on many factors. These include what type of hepatitis you have, whether you have cirrhosis of the liver, and your stage of disease. You and your doctor will decide on the best plan.

Good health habits are essential for those who have hepatitis C. You should especially avoid alcohol and medicines and drugs that can put stress on the liver. You should eat a healthy diet and start exercising regularly. Your family doctor can help you plan a diet that is healthy and practical.

Talk to your doctor about any medicines that you are taking, including over-the-counter medicine. Many medicines, including acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol), are broken down by the liver. Because of this, they may increase the speed of liver damage. You should also limit alcohol use. It speeds the progression of liver diseases like hepatitis C. An occasional alcoholic drink may be okay, but check with your doctor first.

The choice is up to you and your doctor. The decision to use drug therapy can be hard to make because of the potential side effects. Your doctor will closely monitor your symptoms and the amount of the virus in your body. He or she will also consider your overall health. This includes looking at blood test results. All are important factors to consider before you and your doctor start drug treatment for your hepatitis C.

The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of the hepatitis C virus in your blood to levels that can’t be detected after 24 weeks of therapy. The amount of the virus in your blood is called your viral load. At the end of your treatment, your doctor will need to measure your viral load and find out how healthy your liver is. He or she may repeat many of the same tests that were done when you were first diagnosed with hepatitis C.

If your blood has so few copies of the virus that tests can’t measure them, the virus is said to be undetectable. If it stays undetectable for at least 6 months after your treatment is finished, you have what is called a sustained virologic response (SVR). People who have an SVR have a good chance of avoiding serious liver problems in the future.

Treatment may not reduce your viral load. You may not have an SVR after treatment. If that’s true, your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you. For example, if 1 round of treatment did not decrease your viral load enough, your doctor may recommend a second round. Even if treatment doesn’t keep you from having active liver disease, lowering your viral load and controlling chronic liver inflammation may help you feel better for a longer time.","Coping with hepatitis C isn’t easy. You may feel sad, scared, or angry. You may not believe you have the disease. These feelings are normal, but they shouldn’t keep you from living your daily life. If they do — or if they last a long time — you may be suffering from depression. People who are depressed have most or all of the following symptoms nearly every day, all day, for 2 weeks or longer:

• Feeling sad, hopeless and having frequent crying spells.
• Losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy (including sex).
• Feeling guilty, helpless, or worthless.
• Thinking about death or suicide.
• Sleeping too much or having problems sleeping.
• Loss of appetite and unintended weight loss or gain.
• Feeling very tired all the time.
• Having trouble paying attention and making decisions.
• Having aches and pains that don’t get better with treatment.
• Feeling restless, irritated, and easily annoyed.

Talk to your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms. Your doctor can help by recommending a support group or a therapist. He or she may also prescribe a medicine for you to take.","• Do I need treatment?

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","No, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C. (There are vaccines for hepatitis A and hepatitis B.) If you have hepatitis C, your doctor may want you to get the vaccines for hepatitis A and B. If you have hepatitis C, you are more likely to catch hepatitis A or hepatitis B. Catching these viruses would cause more damage to your liver.

Yes, once you have hepatitis C, you can always give it to someone else. If you have hepatitis C, you cannot donate blood. You should avoid sharing personal items like razors and toothbrushes. It is very rare to pass hepatitis C in these ways, but it can happen. Always use a condom when you have sex. If you have hepatitis C, your sexual partners should be tested to see if they also have it.

Talk to your doctor first if you want to have children. The virus isn’t spread easily from a mother to her unborn baby. But it is possible, so you need to take precautions. However, if you’re trying to have a baby, do not have sex during your menstrual cycle. The hepatitis C virus spreads more easily in menstrual blood."
192,Hereditary Hemochromatosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hereditary-hemochromatosis/,"Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disease in which your body has high levels of iron. That means you have too much iron. It’s often called “iron overload.” Your body can’t get rid of the extra iron, and it ends up damaging your tissues and organs. It can lead to liver damage, arthritis, heart problems, and diabetes.

There are four types of hereditary hemochromatosis:

• Type 1 and 4: Symptoms first appear in adulthood. Men start developing symptoms between age 40 and 60; women start developing symptoms after menopause. Type 1 is the most common.
• Type 2: Symptoms may appear in childhood. By age 20, it affects a person’s sex hormones. Girls may begin their periods regularly. However, they may stop after a few years. Puberty can be delayed in boys. If untreated, both men and women could have heart disease by age 30.
• Type 3: This type is a mix of types 1 and 2. Symptoms may appear by age 30.","Symptoms are different for every person. And some people with the disease don’t have symptoms at all. Men have symptoms more often than women. Most people don’t have symptoms until they are older. Symptoms can change depending on the amount of iron you get from your food, iron pills, alcohol, and infections.

You may feel tired. You may have stomach and joint pain. Your sex drive may be reduced. Women may have abnormal periods or early menopause. Your skin may turn bronze or gray. It can cause cirrhosis (permanent liver damage), diabetes, and heart problems.","Hereditary hemochromatosis is genetic. It’s caused by genes, usually the HFE gene. If you have a relative with the disease, talk with your doctor about getting a blood test to see if you have high levels of iron or if you have the disease. If your lab results are normal, you may need to repeat the blood test every few years.","Hereditary hemochromatosis can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms look like other diseases. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, do a physical exam, and order blood tests to check the amount of iron in your blood and liver. Tell your doctor if you have a relative with the disease.

A blood test also can tell if you have the HFE gene. There are benefits of knowing if you have the HFE gene. However, there are risks, too. It may affect your opportunity to get health insurance. That’s why HFE gene testing isn’t usually recommended for children younger than 18.","Hereditary hemochromatosis can’t be prevented. But early diagnosis and treatment can improve symptoms. It also can reduce the chance of you getting more serious health conditions. For example, if you’re diagnosed and treated before you get cirrhosis or diabetes, your life expectancy should be normal.

Other things you can do to improve reduce symptoms include:

• Don’t take iron supplements. Don’t take the vitamins with iron in them.
• Don’t take vitamin C supplements.
• Eat less red meat.
• Reduce your alcohol intake.
• Don’t eat raw shellfish. Don’t touch raw shellfish. It can cause a bacterial infection.","Treatment involves reducing your iron levels. Usually, this is accomplished by removing blood from your body. It involves inserting a needle into a vein to remove extra red blood cells from your blood. This is called phlebotomy and is just like donating blood. You will likely need to have this done on a regular basis. Your doctor will tell you how often, though it’s usually once or twice a week until your iron levels return to normal.

In some cases, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to lower your iron levels. Your doctor will decide which treatment is best for you.","If you have hereditary hemochromatosis, you might need further tests to check for other conditions. For example, you may need a liver biopsy to see if your liver is damaged. Liver damage is called cirrhosis. A liver biopsy involves a doctor removing a small piece of your liver and looking at it under a microscope. If you have cirrhosis, you have a higher risk for getting liver cancer. If the cirrhosis is serious, it may require a liver transplant.","• Can I pass hereditary hemochromatosis on to my children?

193,Hernia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hernia/,"A hernia is a tear in your muscle or tissue that allows part of your insides to bulge out. It can be a bulge of an internal organ or your intestines. Sometimes you can see the hernia, depending on its location and size. Certain activities can worsen the condition, like bending over or lifting heavy objects.

Hernias usually occur in your groin. Inguinal hernias are in the groin and are mostly found in men. Femoral hernias are in the upper thigh near the groin. These are much less common and are mostly found in women. The abdomen is another frequent hernia location. If hernias occur in the midline of the abdomen, they are called ventral hernias. If they occur at the site of a previous surgical scar, they are incisional hernias. Umbilical hernias occur in association with your belly button and are found more commonly in babies.

In a hiatal hernia, part of the upper stomach comes through an opening in your diaphragm, or chest wall. This hernia can cause acid to leak from your stomach into your esophagus. The esophagus is a tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Effects of hiatal hernias include heartburn, indigestion, and acid reflux.

Hernias also can be birth defects. A congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs when your diaphragm doesn’t form right. This can create space for your stomach to move into your chest. Sometimes doctors find the defect when you’re a baby. Other times, they may not find it until later in life. In severe cases, your stomach can crowd your chest organs, like your lungs and heart. Surgery can help repair your diaphragm so that you don’t develop other problems, such as breathing difficulties.","You might not have symptoms, depending on the type of hernia you have. One common sign of a hernia is the visible bulge in the affected area. Other reported symptoms include pressure, a cough, heartburn, and difficulty swallowing. Severe hernia symptoms are shooting pain, vomiting, and constipation. If your hernia becomes soft or you can’t push it in, go to the emergency room. Hernias can cause your organs or tissue to become infected, blocked, or strangled.","The various types of hernias can have different causes. In general, a hernia starts with pressure on an organ or your intestines. A hernia forms when this pressure happens in the same area as a weakened muscle or tissue. Some people are born with weak muscles or tissue that isn’t fully developed. However, most people get hernias as their bodies age and their muscles weaken.

You also can get a hernia, or worsen an existing one, from certain movements and habits. These include:

• Picking up heavy objects (especially lifting them in the wrong way and with weak muscles)
• Overusing the same muscle
• Straining during coughing, sneezing, diarrhea, or constipation
• Being overweight or having poor nutrition
• Using tobacco",Your doctor usually can detect a hernia in a physical exam. They also might order tests to further assess your condition and the cause. An ultrasound test uses sound waves to scan your body. A barium X-ray takes images of your digestive area and intestines. A computed tomography (CT) scan also uses X-rays to get pictures. An endoscopy studies your esophagus and stomach using a small camera at the end of a flexible tube.,"You can’t always prevent hernias. Some are caused by genetics that you can’t avoid. A congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect. You also can be born with weak muscles that make it easier to get a hernia later in life.

You can reduce your chance of getting some types of hernias by:

• Eating smaller meals
• Losing weight if you have obesity
• Avoiding or limiting alcohol and tobacco
• Avoiding or limiting certain foods (such as things that are spicy or high in fiber)
• Using proper lifting techniques to prevent strains","Treatment options depend on the type of hernia you have and your state of health. At first, your doctor may suggest monitoring your condition for changes. This may also include making changes to your diet, activity, and habits. Medicines may help lessen hernia symptoms.

If the hernia doesn’t improve or worsens, your doctor will discuss surgery. There are two types of surgical treatment. Laparoscopic surgery is less invasive. Your doctor or a surgeon will make small cuts in the affected area to fix the hernia. Open repair surgery requires a larger cut to make the repair.

As part of surgery, your doctor might use surgical mesh. This is considered a medical device. The purpose of surgical mesh is to act as a support for your weakened muscle or tissue. Mesh products can be synthetic or made from animal tissue. Surgical mesh comes in two forms. Temporary mesh is one that your body will absorb. It works with your muscles and tissue to strengthen over time. Permanent mesh is meant to provide long-term muscle support.","Most types of hernias can be treated and corrected. However, it’s common for hernias to come back. In some cases, surgical mesh can help reduce this chance. Talk to your doctor or surgeon about the best treatment option for you and how to prevent recurring hernias.

People who have a congenital diaphragmatic hernia may have other health issues. Talk to your doctor about how to treat and manage these.","• Are there exercises I can do to strengthen my muscles and prevent a hernia?
• What’s the chance of my hernia coming back?
• My hernia only bothers me from time to time. Do I even need to see a doctor?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hernia

194,Herniated Disc,https://familydoctor.org/condition/herniated-disc/,"A herniated disc is a painful medical condition that occurs in your spine (backbone). Your spine is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between each of these vertebrae are soft discs. These discs act like cushions and keep the bones of the spine in place. They also let your backbone move so you can bend and stretch.

These discs can weaken over time. Sometimes, they even rupture. The soft, jelly-like center of the disc pushes outward. When this happens, it’s called a herniated disc. (The word “herniate” means to bulge or to stick out.) This is also called a ruptured disc, a slipped disc, or a bulging disc. These discs become a problem when the center of the disc pushes against a nerve or the spinal cord. This causes mild to severe pain.

Herniated discs are most common in the lumbar spine—the lower part of your backbone, between the bottom of your ribs and your hips. They can also happen in your cervical area (your neck). The discs in your upper-to-mid back (thoracic area) are rarely involved.","When part of a disc presses on a nerve, it can cause pain. Often the pain occurs on one side of your body. Where the pain is located depends on where the herniated disc is located.

A slipped disc in the cervical section of your spine can cause pain in your neck and arms. You could experience:

• Pain when moving your neck
• Pain near the shoulder blade
• Shooting pain down the arm and into the fingers
• Numbness in the shoulder, elbow, forearm, or fingers
• Weakness

A slipped disc in the lumbar part of your spine can cause pain in the back and legs. It is often referred to as sciatica. This is because the disc pushes on the sciatic nerve, which runs down your leg. Symptoms include:

• Pain in the leg, hip, or buttocks
• Numbness in these areas
• Pain or numbness in the back of the calf or sole of the foot
• Weakness in one leg

How bad the symptoms are depends on how much of the disc is pressing on the nerve. The pain from a herniated disc is usually worse when you’re active and gets better when you’re resting. Coughing, sneezing, sitting, driving, and bending forward may make the pain worse. These movements put more pressure on the nerve. People who have painful herniated discs often try to change positions to reduce the pain.","As you age, the discs in your spine weaken and become flatter (less cushiony). If a disc becomes too weak, the outer part may tear. The inside part of the disc then pushes through the tear and presses on the nerves beside it. You could be at higher risk of getting a herniated disc if you:

• Are middle-aged or older
• Lift heavy objects
• Are overweight
• Do repetitive actions involving bending or twisting
• Sit in the same position for a long time regularly
• Live an inactive lifestyle
• Smoke","Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and give you an exam. He or she will check you for numbness, weakness, reflexes changes, and pain. They will probably order X-rays or other pictures to see if you have a herniated disc. These could include a CT scan or an MRI. There are also nerve tests your doctor can order. These can determine what nerves are involved, if there is nerve damage, and how well your nerves are conducting feelings.","There’s not much you can do to prevent a herniated disc. It is often caused by natural aging and deterioration. To keep your discs and back in good working order, follow a healthy lifestyle:

• Maintain a healthy weight
• Exercise regularly
• Strengthen your back and abdomen muscles
• Avoid repetitive movements
• If you sit all day, get up and walk around every hour
• Practice safe lifting and bending techniques","There are several steps that can be taken to treat a herniated disc.

Medicine – Your doctor may recommend over-the-counter pain medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) or prescribe a pain medicine. They may also give you muscle relaxants to relieve muscle spasms that can increase pain.

Physical therapy – Certain exercises can be helpful for a herniated disc. Exercise can make your back and stomach muscles stronger. This will ease the pressure on your disc and make you hurt less. Ask your doctor about exercises for your back. Your doctor may want you to see a physical therapist to learn about safe back exercises.

Epidural steroid injections – If medicine and physical therapy aren’t helping, your doctor may suggest steroid injections. These are shots of steroids that are injected directly into your spine. The steroids reduce the swelling around the disc and can lessen the pain. Sometimes 1 injection is enough. Often, they are given in a series of shots over a few weeks. These injections can bring relief for weeks or months at a time.

Surgery – If nothing else is helping your pain, your doctor may suggest surgery. He or she will remove all or part of the damaged disc so it no longer presses on the nerve.

Home treatment – You can practice good home care to treat your disc, as well. Good posture can help your back by reducing the pressure on your disc. Focus on standing up straight, sitting straight, and lifting with your back straight. Follow these tips to do what you can on your own to ease your symptoms:

• Bend your knees and hips and keep your back straight when you lift something.
• Hold an object close to your body when you carry it.
• If you stand for a long time, put one foot on a small stool or box for a while.
• If you sit for a long time, put your feet on a small stool so your knees are higher than your hips.
• Don’t wear high-heeled shoes.","Your chances of getting better are good. Most people who have a herniated disc are better in about 4 weeks. Sometimes it takes longer. If you still have pain or numbness after 4 to 6 weeks, or if you feel worse, talk with your doctor. Sometimes it takes surgery to relieve pain.

Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:

• Trouble going to the bathroom
• Loss of bowel or bladder function
• Loss of feeling in the feet or legs
• Weight loss
• Severe pain at night
• More pain or weakness than usual in your backbone

These could be signs of complications or a more serious problem.","• Will I always have a herniated disc?

195,Herpes,https://familydoctor.org/condition/herpes/,"Herpes is the name of a group of viruses that cause painful blisters and sores. The most common viruses are:

• Herpes zoster: This causes chickenpox and shingles.
• Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2: Type 1 usually causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth. Type 2 usually causes sores on the genitals (sexual organs).

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Once you’re infected, you have the virus for the rest of your life.","Many people who get herpes never have symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms are mild and are mistaken for another skin condition. Symptoms of genital herpes may include:

• Painful sores in the genital area, anus, buttocks, or thighs
• Itching
• Painful urination
• Vaginal discharge
• Tender lumps in the groin

During the first outbreak (called primary herpes), you may experience flu-like symptoms. These include body aches, fever, and headache. Many people who have a herpes infection will have outbreaks of sores and symptoms from time to time. Symptoms are usually less severe than the primary outbreak. The frequency of outbreaks also tends to decrease over time.","The virus that causes genital herpes is usually spread from one person to another during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. The virus can enter your body through a break in your skin. It can also enter through the skin of your mouth, penis, vagina, urinary tract opening, or anus.

Herpes is most easily spread when blisters or sores can be seen on the infected person. But it can be spread at any time, even when the person who has herpes isn’t experiencing any symptoms. Herpes can also be spread from one place on your body to another. If you touch sores on your genitals, you can carry the virus on your fingers. Then you can pass it onto other parts of your body, including your mouth or eyes.",Your doctor will do a physical exam and look at the sores. He or she can do a culture of the fluid from a sore and test it for herpes. Blood tests or other tests on the fluid from a blister can also be done.,"The best way to prevent getting herpes is to not have sex with anyone who has the virus. It can be spread even when the person who has it isn’t showing any symptoms. If your partner has herpes, there is no way of knowing for sure that you won’t get it.

If you are infected, there is no time that is completely safe to have sex and not spread herpes. You must tell your sex partner if you have herpes. You should avoid having sex if you have any sores. Herpes can spread from one person to another very easily when sores are present.

You should use condoms every time you have sex. They can help reduce the risk of spreading herpes, but it’s still possible to spread or get herpes if you’re using a condom.","If you think you have herpes, see your doctor as soon as possible. It’s easier to diagnose when there are sores. You can start treatment sooner and perhaps have less pain with the infection.

There’s no cure for herpes. But medicines can help. They may be provided as a pill, cream, or a shot. Medicines such as acyclovir and valacyclovir fight the herpes virus. They can speed up healing and lessen the pain of herpes for many people. They can be used to treat a primary outbreak or a recurrent one.

If the medicines are being used to treat a recurrence, they should be started as soon as you feel tingling, burning, or itching. They can also be taken every day to prevent recurrences.","It’s common to feel guilty or ashamed when you are diagnosed with herpes. You may feel your sex life is ruined or that someone you thought you could trust has hurt you. You may feel sad or upset. Talk to your family doctor about how you’re feeling.

Keep in mind that herpes is very common. About 1 in 6 adults have it. Herpes may get less severe as time goes by. You can help protect your sex partner by not having sex during outbreaks and by using condoms at other times.","• What is the best treatment for me?
• Are there any side effects to my treatment?
• Is it safe to have unprotected sex if I don’t have any sores?
• Can I give myself genital herpes if I also have oral herpes?
• Can I give someone else herpes even if I’m not having an outbreak?

• Primary stage: This stage starts 2 to 8 days after you’re infected. Usually, the infection causes groups of small, painful blisters. The fluid in the blisters may be clear or cloudy, and the area under the blisters will be red. The blisters then break open and become open sores. You may not notice the blisters, or they may be painful. It may hurt to urinate during this stage. While most people have a painful primary stage of infection, some don’t have any symptoms. In fact, they may not even know they’re infected.
• Latent stage: During this stage, there are no blisters, sores, or other symptoms. The virus is traveling from your skin into the nerves near your spine.
• Shedding stage: In the shedding stage, the virus starts multiplying in the nerve endings. If these nerve endings are in areas of the body that make or are in contact with body fluids, the virus can get into those body fluids. This could include saliva, semen, or vaginal fluids. There are no symptoms during this stage, but the virus can be spread during this time. This means that herpes is very contagious during this stage.

Many people have blisters and sores that come back after the first herpes attack goes away. This is called a recurrence. Usually, the symptoms aren’t as bad as they were during the first attack.

Stress, being sick, or being tired may start a recurrence. Being in the sun or having your menstrual period may also cause a recurrence. Another way you may know a recurrence is about to happen is if you feel itching, tingling, or pain in the places where you were first infected.

It’s important to avoid getting herpes during pregnancy. If your partner has herpes and you don’t have it, be sure to always use condoms during sexual intercourse. Your partner could pass the infection to you even if they are not currently experiencing an outbreak. If there are visible sores, avoid having sex completely until the sores have healed.

If you’re pregnant and have genital herpes, or if you have ever had sex with someone who had it, tell your doctor. The doctor will give you an antiviral medicine to start taking toward the end of your pregnancy. This will make it less likely that you will have an outbreak at or near the time you deliver your baby.

Understand that you can pass herpes to your baby if you have an active genital herpes infection at or near the time of delivery. When the baby passes through the birth canal, it may come in contact with sores and become infected with the virus. This can cause brain damage, blindness, or even death in newborns.

Your doctor will most likely deliver your baby by C-section if you do have an outbreak of genital herpes at the time of delivery. With a C-section, the baby won’t go through the birth canal and be exposed to the virus. This lessens the risk of giving herpes to your baby.

• Talk to your doctor if you think you may have herpes.
• Remember you’re not alone. Millions of people have herpes.
• Keep yourself healthy and limit your stress.
• Don’t touch your sores.
• Tell your sex partner and use condoms.

• Take aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).
• Place lukewarm or cool cloths on the sore place.
• Take lukewarm baths. (A woman may urinate in the tub at the end of the bath if she is having pain urinating. This may help dilute the urine so it doesn’t burn the sores so badly.)
• Keep the area dry and clean.
• Wear cotton underwear.
• Wear loose-fitting clothes."
196,Hidradenitis Suppurativa,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hidradenitis-suppurativa/,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic (long-term) skin disease. HS is considered a severe form of acne. People who have it develop painful red bumps or sores in places where they grow hair. This includes the armpits, groin, genitals, and anal area. They also can occur in places where the skin rubs together. This includes between the thighs or under the breasts for women.","The main symptom of HS is painful red bumps. The bumps get bigger, become inflamed, and leak pus. They form large sores and blisters. HS can itch and cause a foul odor in the affected area.","HS occurs when sweat glands and hair follicle openings become blocked. Doctors don’t know why this happens. Poor hygiene does not cause this condition. It is not contagious. You cannot get it from or pass it to anyone.

HS is more common in women than men. People who have a history of acne are at a greater risk. HS may run in families.","If you have any of the symptoms mentioned above, see your doctor. They can tell if you have HS by looking at the affected skin. The doctor may test a sample of your skin cells (biopsy) or pus from the bumps. This can rule out other issues and confirm the diagnosis.","It is difficult to prevent HS or flare-ups caused by the disease. However, obesity and smoking are related to this condition. Quitting smoking and healthy eating and exercise may help to prevent the likelihood of HS and limit flare-ups in those that have it.","There is no cure for HS. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. The type of treatment you receive depends on how severe your condition is. For mild cases, apply a warm compress to the affected area. Wash the area with anti-bacterial soap. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce swelling and relieve pain.

More severe cases may require antibiotics. These can be topical (applied to your skin) or oral (taken by mouth). Antibiotics help prevent or treat infection. For some people, HS gets worse over time. Scarring can occur in the affected area. These people may need surgery to remove the sores and scars. People who have surgery to remove HS may get it again.","Treatment can help manage the symptoms of HS. It may help to avoid:

• Tight, synthetic clothing
• Hot, humid climates
• Shaving
• Using deodorant
• Stress

Try to lose weight if you are overweight. Also work to stay healthy by exercising and getting enough sleep.

For some, living with HS can be embarrassing or cause feelings of guilt. It is important to remember that this is not a contagious condition, and it is not due to poor hygiene. If you are stressed or embarrassed about HS, you should talk to your doctor.","• Do I have hidradenitis suppurativa?
• What treatment is best for me?
• Do I need to take medicine? If so, for how long and what are the side effects?
• How do I know if I need surgery?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to relieve my symptoms?
• Will I always have HS, or will it go away on its own?
• If I have surgery to remove HS, what is the chance of it coming back?
• What should I do if my condition gets worse?","National Institutes of Health, Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Hidradenitis suppurativa

197,High Blood Pressure (Hypertension),https://familydoctor.org/condition/high-blood-pressure/,"Blood pressure is the force of your blood as it flows through the arteries in your body. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, it pushes blood through your arteries. As the blood flows, it puts pressure on your artery walls. This is called blood pressure.

High blood pressure (also called hypertension) happens when your blood moves through your arteries at a higher pressure than normal. Many different things can cause hypertension. If your blood pressure gets too high or stays high for a long time, it can cause health problems. Uncontrolled hypertension puts you at a higher risk for stroke, heart disease, heart attack, and kidney failure.

There are 2 types of hypertension.

Primary hypertension. This is also called essential hypertension. It has no known cause, and it is the most common type of hypertension. This type of blood pressure usually takes many years to develop. It probably is a result of your lifestyle, environment, and how your body changes as you age.

Secondary hypertension. This is when a health problem or medicine is causing your high blood pressure. Things that can cause secondary hypertension include:

• Kidney problems
• Sleep apnea
• Thyroid or adrenal gland problems
• Some medicines","Most people who have hypertension do not have symptoms. This is why it’s sometimes called “the silent killer.” It is very important to have your blood pressure checked regularly.

Some people experience headaches, nosebleeds, or shortness of breath with hypertension. However, those symptoms can mimic many other things (serious or non-serious). Usually, these symptoms occur once blood pressure has reached a dangerously high level over a period of time.","Food, medicine, lifestyle, age, and genetics can cause hypertension. Your doctor can help you find out what might be causing yours. Common factors that can lead to hypertension include:

• A diet high in salt, fat, and/or cholesterol
• Chronic conditions such as kidney and hormone problems, diabetes, and high cholesterol
• Family history, especially if your parents or other close relatives have hypertension
• Lack of physical activity
• Older age (the older you are, the more likely you are to have hypertension)
• Being overweight or having obesity
• Race (non-Hispanic black people are more likely to have hypertension than people of other races)
• Some birth control medicines and other medicines
• Stress
• Tobacco use or drinking too much alcohol","Hypertension is diagnosed with a blood pressure monitor. This is a common test for all doctor visits. A nurse will place a band (cuff) around your arm. The band attaches to a small pump and a meter. They will squeeze the pump. It will feel tight around your arm. Then they will stop and watch the meter. This provides the nurse with 2 numbers that make up your blood pressure. The top number is your systolic reading (the peak blood pressure when your heart is squeezing blood out). The bottom number is your diastolic reading (the pressure when your heart is filling with blood­). You may also hear the doctor or nurse say a blood pressure is “120 over 80.”

• Normal blood pressure is less than 120 on top and less than 80 on the bottom.
• Prehypertension levels are 120-139 on top and 80-89 on the bottom.
• High blood pressure, stage 1 is 140-159 on top and 90-99 on the bottom.
• High blood pressure, stage 2 is 160 or higher on top and 100 and over on the bottom.

The higher your blood pressure is, the more often you need to have it checked. After age 18, have your blood pressure checked at least once every two years. Do it more often if you have had high blood pressure in the past.","If lifestyle factors are causing your hypertension, you can take steps to reduce your risk:

• Lose weight
• Stop smoking
• Eat properly
• Exercise
• Lower your salt intake
• Reduce your alcohol consumption
• Learn relaxation methods

If your hypertension is caused by disease or the medicine you take, talk to your doctor. They may be able to prescribe a different medicine. Additionally, treating any underlying disease (such as controlling your diabetes) can help reduce your high blood pressure.","The best way to lower blood pressure begins with changes you can make to your lifestyle to help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease. Additionally, your doctor may prescribe medicine to lower your blood pressure. These are called antihypertensive medicines.

The goal of treatment is to reduce your blood pressure to normal levels. If changes to your lifestyle aren’t enough to reduce your blood pressure to a normal level, your doctor will prescribe medicine. Medicine for treatment is often highly successful. If your blood pressure can only be controlled with medicine, you’ll likely need to take the medicine for the rest of your life. It is common to need more than one medicine to help control your blood pressure. Don’t stop taking the medicine without talking with your doctor. Otherwise, you may increase your risk of having a stroke or heart attack.","Controlling your hypertension is a lifelong commitment. You will always need to monitor your weight, make healthy food choices, exercise, learn to cope with stress, avoid smoking, and limit your alcohol intake. If you need medicine to control your high blood pressure, you will likely need it all your life.

Additionally, you will need to get used to regular blood pressure checks. Your doctor may want you to come to the office regularly. Or your doctor may ask you to check your blood pressure at home and keep track of your numbers. Some pharmacies and retail clinics have blood pressure machines on site. You can buy your own, automated arm blood pressure cuff for use at home. Your doctor may want you to check your blood pressure several times a day. Another option is to use an ambulatory (wear as you are moving about) blood pressure monitor.","• Can children have high blood pressure?

198,High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/high-blood-pressure-during-pregnancy/,"A small percentage of pregnant women in the U.S. have high blood pressure at some point during their pregnancy. Some cases are mild; other cases are severe. Treatment varies depending on the type you have and how far along you are in your pregnancy.

There are three main types of high blood pressure during pregnancy:

• Chronic hypertension. This is high blood pressure you had before you became pregnant. It can also refer to high blood pressure you get before the 20th week of pregnancy. Sometimes you may have high blood pressure for a long time before becoming pregnant but don’t know it until your first prenatal visit with your doctor. Chronic hypertension can lead to serious problems, including preeclampsia. This type of high blood pressure continues after you have your baby.
• Gestational hypertension. This is high blood pressure you get after your 20th week of pregnancy. Most of the time, this hypertension doesn’t hurt you or your baby. You may not even have other symptoms. However, sometimes this type of hypertension is severe. It can cause your baby to be born smaller than normal (have a low birth weight). Your baby may even be born early because of it. It can lead to preeclampsia. And while it usually goes away within three months of giving birth, it can raise your risk of getting high blood pressure in the future.
• Preeclampsia.This is a sudden rise in your blood pressure after your 20th week of pregnancy, typically in your third trimester. It may cause damage to your liver, kidneys, or brain. You may have seizures. You may have significant swelling in your legs and sometimes your arms and face. This condition is serious. It can hurt both you and your baby, and even be life threatening. Some women get preeclampsia after they deliver their baby. This is called postpartum preeclampsia.

In some cases, high blood pressure during pregnancy can cause harm to you and your baby. You may develop gestational diabetes. You may also experience problems with your heart or kidneys. You’re also at greater risk for a stroke.

High blood pressure may prevent the placenta from getting enough blood. If the placenta doesn’t get enough blood, your baby doesn’t get enough oxygen and food. This can cause low birth weight and premature birth.

High blood pressure can also lead to placental abruption. This is when the placenta becomes unattached to the uterus. This can be a life-threatening situation to both you and your baby.","Keep in mind that some of these symptoms are common among pregnant women and don’t necessarily mean you have a problem. Talk with your doctor if you have any of the following:

• Constant headache
• Changes to your vision
• Abdominal pain
• Nausea and vomiting
• Shortness of breath
• Swelling of your hands and face
• Low, or no, urine","Some women have a greater risk of getting high blood pressure while they’re pregnant. These include women who:

• Are having their first baby
• Have a mom or sister who had high blood pressure while pregnant
• Are carrying multiple babies (twins, triplets)
• Are older than 40 years old
• Are African American
• Were overweight when they became pregnant
• Had high blood pressure before they became pregnant","No one test diagnoses high blood pressure while pregnant. Instead, your doctor will take your blood pressure at each of your prenatal appointments. They will keep track of your blood pressure readings during your pregnancy and be able to spot any changes that could indicate an overall problem. They will also use urine and blood tests to watch for possible issues.","It can’t be prevented. However, you can lower your chances of getting it by making necessary adjustments before getting pregnant. These include getting or maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.

If you have chronic hypertension before you get pregnant, talk with your doctor. They will look at how well your hypertension is being managed and let you know if you need to make any changes before getting pregnant.","If you have chronic hypertension, you may have been taking medicine for it before you became pregnant. Tell your doctor which medicine you’re taking. He or she may say it’s okay to continue that medicine. But if the medicine isn’t safe for your baby, you may need to switch to another medicine during your pregnancy. Like with all pregnancies, your doctor will check your blood pressure and urine during your regular appointments.

If you have gestational hypertension, your doctor will monitor your blood pressure and urine more closely. They will do this to watch for signs of preeclampsia. Your doctor may also monitor your baby. One way to do that is with an ultrasound. This is a painless test that lets your doctor see your baby inside your body.

If you have preeclampsia, treatment depends on where you are in relation to your due date. That’s because preeclampsia often goes away after you have your baby. If you’re 37 weeks or more pregnant, your doctor may suggest having the baby as soon as possible. However, if you’re less than 37 weeks pregnant, your doctor may choose to monitor you even more closely than before.

Along with the regular urine and blood tests, you may need to take medicine to help your blood pressure. You may also need to take medicine that help prevent seizures, which can happen with preeclampsia. You may be told to stay in bed until your baby is born. You may be given a steroid shot of a medicine that will help your baby’s lungs develop quicker in case your baby needs to be born early. Your baby will continue to be watched with ultrasound. Your doctor may also watch your baby’s health through a heart monitor. If your preeclampsia is extremely severe, your doctor may say you need to deliver your baby right away, regardless of how close you are to your due date.","Go to each of your prenatal visits with your doctor. This will allow them to monitor your blood pressure. Your doctor may ask you to record your blood pressure at home. They can give advice on how to do that. Your doctor will check your urine at each visit. High levels of protein in urine can be a symptom of preeclampsia.

Discuss all your medicines with your doctor. Also, don’t start or stop taking any medicines, including over-the-counter medicines, without talking to your doctor. Some of these may affect your blood pressure.","• I’m pregnant and have high blood pressure. How great is my risk of developing gestational hypertension or preeclampsia?
• Is there anything I can do to reduce my risk?
• Will medicines help me?
• How often will I need to see you for appointments?
• What are my treatment options?
• Will I need bed rest?
• Will I need a C-section? Or can I have a vaginal birth?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy

201,Hip Fractures,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hip-fractures/,"A hip fracture is a break in your thigh bone (femur) where it connects to your pelvic bone. Hip fractures can happen at any age. In younger people, it typically happens with car accidents or other significant injuries. However, hip fractures are more common in people 65 and older. It also is more common in women. That’s because women often have a disease that weakens bones. This is called osteoporosis. Hip fractures in older individuals are serious and require immediate medical attention. It can be difficult to fully recover from a hip fracture at an older age and can affect your ability to live independently. As the U.S. population grows older, there will be an increase in hip fracture cases.","If you fracture your hip, you may have the following symptoms:

• Severe pain in your hip or groin area
• Discomfort when trying to move or rotate your hip
• Bruising and/or swelling in your hip area
• Unable to put weight on your hip
• Unable to walk
• The injured leg may look shorter than the other leg (it may turn outward)","Most hip fractures are caused by a fall. Other causes include cancer and injury. Women break their hip more often than men. That’s because women often have a condition that weakens bones. It is called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is caused by not having enough calcium to maintain healthy bones. As you get older, balance becomes more of a challenge and your risk for a hip fracture will increase. As men and women get older, they lose bone mass. Bones become brittle and break easily.","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, pain and if you’ve fallen or been injured. They will order an X-ray to check for hip fracture.","Several things can help reduce or prevent a hip fracture, including:

• Ask your doctor if any of the medicines you are currently taking cause you to be sleepy or dizzy. This will impact your balance an increase your risk of falls.
• Get plenty of calcium from foods (milk, cottage cheese, yogurt, sardines, and broccoli).
• Talk to your doctor about taking vitamin D. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. They can tell you how much to take.
• Exercise to keep your bones and muscles strong. This is best done by doing exercises with weights or strength training.
• Don’t drink or smoke.
• Get outside in the sun (with sunscreen). The sun helps your body produce its own vitamin D.
• Have your vision checked once a year. Eye diseases as you get older can affect your ability to see. This can lead to falls.
• Use a cane or walker if your doctor suggests it. This will help your balance and help you avoid falls.
• If you are a woman, get screened for osteoporosis.
• Talk to your doctor about medicines that can improve your bone health.
• Make your house safer. This includes: Good lighting (also add nightlights in the bedroom, hallways, stairs, and bathrooms) Fasten rugs with nonskid backing. Tack down loose ends that curl up. Keep electrical cords picked up and out of the way. Install handrails in the shower, bath, and toilet area. Add handrails to each side of your stairs.

This will involve anesthesia and a hospital stay. The length of the stay depends on your health and the severity of the break. Some people are unable to have hip surgery because of illness or poor health. When this happens, your doctor may consider putting you into traction. Traction uses a medical device to keep you from moving and walking. The length of time you are in traction depends on the severity of your break.

After surgery, you may have a long recovery. Your doctor will tell you when you should try to stand or walk. It may be painful to walk at first. You may need a walker or cane for several months.

You may need to see a physical therapist after surgery. This is a medical provider who will teach you how to properly sit, stand and walk without reinjuring your hip. You’ll receive exercises to do at home. You also may need some home care for daily tasks. This includes bathing, dressing, cooking, errands, etc.

Your doctor will discuss hip replacement if your fracture was severe and permanent.","Complications from a hip fracture can be severe and life-threatening. While you are immobile, you are at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a blood clot in a vein deep inside your body. These clots usually occur in your leg veins. If the blood clot breaks away and travels through your bloodstream, it could travel to your lungs. This can be fatal.

Other complications from after hip surgery can include:

• Pressure sores (deep sores on your skin that can become infected)
• Pneumonia
• Muscle wasting or atrophy (your muscles become smaller and inactive)
• Urinary tract infections","• How can I tell the difference between a hip fracture and sprain?

202,Hip Problems in Infants,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hip-problems-in-infants/,"A hip problem in infants is known as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). It is when the ball of the hip joint isn’t formed properly and does not fit well in the socket. Often, this means that the hip joint is loose and prone to injury. DDH can lead to dislocation of the hip or other health issues.","Hip problems may not be easy to see at first. Most babies do not show symptoms. One sign to look for is if their hips don’t open well when you change their diaper. Once your child is walking, a limp may be a sign of DDH.","The exact cause of DDH is unknown. It is more common in:

• Breech births (in a bottom-first position before birth instead of a head-first position)
• First born
• Twins or multiple births
• Babies who are large in size
• Girls (their ligaments tend to be more flexible)
• Families with a history of DDH.","Usually, the doctor can feel if something is wrong. The doctor first checks your baby’s hips in the hospital after birth. They do this by gently pushing and pulling the baby’s thigh bones to see if they are loose in the hip socket. An ultrasound may be needed to get a picture of the hip. X-rays can be taken once your baby is 4 months old.

Hip problems may not be present at birth. They may become an issue as your baby’s body develops. The doctor will check your baby’s hips at each well-baby check-up. As your child grows, the doctor checks to see if your baby’s thighs spread apart easily.

Your doctor may recommend an ultrasound even if the physical exam of your baby is normal. Most doctors follow the recommendation to do this for infants who are breech or when there is a family history of DDH.","DDH cannot be avoided since the cause is unknown. However, there are some things you can do to keep it from getting worse:

• Use a proper method to swaddle your baby. Do not wrap their legs too tight. Your baby should have room to move their hips and keep their joints loose.
• Buy products that protect your baby’s legs and hips. This includes baby seats, slings, swings, and carriers. Follow the instructions to use these products properly.
• Be careful when wearing your baby in a carrier. Your baby’s hips should be in a spread squat position. This means their hips are open and their knees are bent at the same height as or higher than their bottom. Their legs should be able to wrap around your torso.
• Tell your doctor if you, another child, or a relative has DHH. This increases the chance of your baby having DDH.","Treatment may not be needed right away. Instead, the doctor will continue to check your baby’s hips to make sure they grow correctly. If the problem does not go away, gets worse, or is severe, the doctor likely will decide to treat the issue.

A soft brace, called a “Pavlik harness,” can treat most hip problems. This brace keeps your baby’s knees spread apart and bent up toward the chest. The doctor should check your baby’s hips the first few weeks to see if the hip is going into place and staying there. Once the hip is in place, your baby keeps wearing the brace for another 2 or 3 months. Your baby wears the brace day and night for about 3 to 6 months total.

About 1 in 20 babies needs more than a brace to fix a hip problem. Surgery is needed in more severe cases. A closed reduction surgery involves moving the hip joint back into place. An open reduction surgery involves removing or dislocating the hip joint. This allows the doctor to clean out the socket then align and reattach the hip joint correctly. After surgery, your baby may wear a cast and/or brace for several months to keep the hip in place.","Treatment and ongoing monitoring should fix DDH. There is a chance of future recurring problems, such as dislocation. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of treatment, as well as possible related issues. You may benefit from joining a support group of other parents who have dealt with the same problem.","• How severe is my child’s hip problem?
• How often do you see this condition in other children?
• Will my child need to see a specialist?
• What is the best form of treatment and how effective is it?
• What are the benefits and risks of surgery?
• Will my child need to wear a brace or cast? If so, for how long?
• Is my child at risk for other hip problems later in life?","International Hip Dysplasia Institute: Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)

203,Hirschsprung’s Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hirschsprungs-disease/,"Hirschsprung disease is a rare birth defect that affects the large intestine (bowel). This condition occurs while a baby is in the womb. It is caused by missing nerve cells in the intestine. These nerve cells tell your intestine to push stools through your bowel. Cells may be missing from a small part of the intestine near the bottom (anus). Or cells may be missing from a large part of the intestine. This causes stools to back up in the intestine. It causes severe constipation, blockage, and colon infections.","The earliest sign of Hirschsprung disease is when your newborn baby does not have a bowel movement. This should occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after birth. Other symptoms include:

• Constipation or gas, which may make your baby fussy
• Poor appetite
• Swelling of the stomach
• Vomiting bile (a green liquid) after eating
• Bloody diarrhea
• Inability to pass a stool
• Infrequent or explosive stools

Sometimes, symptoms are not present at birth. This may mean your child has a milder case. Symptoms in older children may include:

• Chronic constipation
• Lack of weight gain or growth
• Swollen abdomen
• Diarrhea
• Frequent bowel movements
• Anemia (a low number of red blood cells)","As a baby grows in the womb, their nerve cells may not grow from the top of the intestine to the anus. Doctors do not know what causes the nerve cells to stop growing.

Hirschsprung disease can be genetic. This means a parent could pass it on to their child. The rare disease is 5 times more frequent in males than in females. Children who have inherited or congenital conditions are at a higher risk as well. This includes Down syndrome.","Talk to your doctor if your child has any of the symptoms listed above. Most cases are found shortly after birth. Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your family history. If your doctor suspects Hirschsprung disease, they will order imaging tests, such as an X-Ray of your child’s abdomen. Your doctor may take a sample of tissue (biopsy) from inside your child’s bottom. A baby cannot be tested for the condition while in the womb.","Since the cause of Hirschsprung’s disease is unknown, you cannot prevent or avoid it. However, parents who have the disease can unknowingly pass it on to their children.","Surgery is the only way to treat Hirschsprung’s disease. It should be done as soon as it is diagnosed. The type of surgery your child has depends on the severity of the disease.

The most common type is a pull-through surgery. The surgeon will remove the part of the intestine that is missing nerve cells. They reattach the healthy part of the intestine to the anus. During surgery, the surgeon may need to remove all or part of the colon as well. Once your child heals, they will have a functioning intestine.

Children who have more severe cases of Hirschsprung disease may need an ostomy surgery. The surgeon brings the end of the intestine through an opening in the stomach, called a stoma. They attach it to a pouch called an ostomy. The pouch sits outside the body to collect stool. This creates an alternate way to remove stool from your child’s body. The pouch should be emptied regularly to dispose of the stool. When the surgeon attaches part of the large intestine to the stoma it is called a colostomy. When the surgeon attaches part of the small intestine to the stoma it is called an ileostomy.

Your child may have this surgery prior to the pull-through procedure. It allows their intestine to heal. In this case, the ostomy is a temporary solution. If nerve cells are missing from too much of the intestine, the ostomy may be permanent.

During either surgery, your child may need a feeding tube. This helps them receive the nutrients they need. Feeding tubes can be inserted through the nose or the stomach.","Hirschsprung’s disease cannot be cured on its own. It can be fatal for children who do not have surgery.

After surgery, most children lead normal lives. They may have minor health problems because of the disease. These include diarrhea, constipation, or other problems passing stool. Some children develop an infection called enterocolitis (digestive tract inflammation). This can be serious, so call your doctor right away if your child has the following symptoms:

• Vomiting
• Fever
• Swollen stomach
• Abnormal fatigue
• Blood in the stool

Some problems can occur after pull-through, including:

• Narrowing of the anus
• Constipation
• Diarrhea
• Leaking stool from the anus
• Delayed toilet training
• Enterocolitis (digestive tract inflammation)

Children may need to make some lifestyle changes to help manage their condition. For instance, eating foods that are high in fiber can help reduce constipation. The large intestine absorbs water and salt that the body needs. If your child has a large portion of the intestine removed, it will absorb less. Make sure your child gets plenty of fluids and salt to make up for this.

Your baby and older children will feel better after ostomy surgery because they will be able to pass stool easily. Adjusting to life with an ostomy pouch will take time and may make your child feel different. Your child will need to learn how to care for the stoma and how to change the ostomy pouch. With a few lifestyle changes, children with ostomies can lead normal lives. An ostomy nurse can answer questions and show your child how to care for an ostomy.","• My child seems to be constipated a lot. Does this mean they have Hirschsprung disease?
• Which type of surgery does my child need?
• How long does surgery last and what are the risks?
• How long will it take my child to recover from surgery?
• Is there anything special I should give my child to eat or drink before surgery?
• What lifestyle changes does my child need to make after surgery?
• Will my child be able to lead a normal life?
• What will happen if my child does not have surgery?
• If I have a child who has Hirschsprung disease, what is the chance my future children could have it as well?","National Institutes of Health, Genetics Home Reference: Hirschsprung disease

204,Hirsutism,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hirsutism/,Hirsutism is a condition where women have excess hair on their face or body.,"The main symptom of hirsutism is unwanted hair growth on a woman’s face, chest, and back. This thick, dark hair is different from the normal, fine “baby” hair on other parts of the body.

Other symptoms of hirsutism may include:

• Acne.
• Abnormal menstrual periods.
• Deepening of the voice.
• Increased muscle mass.
• Decreased breast size.","There are several main causes of hirsutism. These include:

• Genetics: The condition can run in families.
• Ethnicity: Women from certain cultures are more likely to have hirsutism. This includes women of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Mediterranean descent.
• High levels of male hormones (called androgens): This is often related to a certain condition, such as: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): This is an imbalance of hormone levels in a woman’s body. It causes cysts to form in the ovaries, as well as other symptoms. Cushing’s syndrome: This is caused by long-time exposure to the hormone cortisol. Tumors: Tumors in your ovaries or adrenal gland can affect your hormone levels.
• Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): This is an imbalance of hormone levels in a woman’s body. It causes cysts to form in the ovaries, as well as other symptoms.
• Cushing’s syndrome: This is caused by long-time exposure to the hormone cortisol.
• Tumors: Tumors in your ovaries or adrenal gland can affect your hormone levels.
• Medicines: These include hormones, anabolic steroids, and medicines used to treat endometriosis.
• Hair follicles: Some people have hair follicles that are overly sensitive to male hormones. Doctors do not know the cause of this.

• Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): This is an imbalance of hormone levels in a woman’s body. It causes cysts to form in the ovaries, as well as other symptoms.
• Cushing’s syndrome: This is caused by long-time exposure to the hormone cortisol.
• Tumors: Tumors in your ovaries or adrenal gland can affect your hormone levels.","Contact your doctor if you have abnormal hair growth or other related symptoms. The doctor may run tests to check your hormone levels. If they are high in androgens, they may do an ultrasound to check your ovaries or a CT scan to check your adrenal gland. These tests can show if you have any tumors.",You cannot prevent or avoid hirsutism.,"Medicines can help treat most cases of hirsutism. They can balance out your hormone levels to reduce the amount of androgens.

Below are types of medicines your doctor may prescribe:

• Anti-androgens: Common ones are spironolactone and finasteride. These block your body from producing male hormones. They also can decrease the amount of new hair growth. However, they cannot get rid of the hair you already have. Anti-androgens take at least 3 to 6 months to work. They can cause birth defects. Do not take them if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant.
• Birth control pills: These decrease the androgens in your body. Birth control pills are a good option for women who do not wish to become pregnant in the near future. They can be used in combination with anti-androgen medicines.
• Topical creams: The most common prescription cream is elfornithine. It slows down the growth of facial hair. You apply it to the areas of unwanted hair on your face and chin. The cream takes about 4 to 8 weeks to start to work. Side effects may include skin irritation, a rash, or a stinging feeling.

Some women choose to permanently remove their hair. There are two types of procedures that do this. Talk to your doctor to see if these procedures would be right for you.

• Electrolysis: The doctor inserts thin needles into the follicles of your unwanted hair. The needles release electrical charges that destroy the follicles. This procedure can be painful and expensive. It may be needed more than once.
• Laser therapy: The doctor uses targeted lasers to damage the follicles. This causes your unwanted hair to fall out. You may need several sessions of treatments to fully treat the follicles. The treatments can cause your skin to become red, swollen, or irritated. There is a risk of burning, scarring, and discolored skin. For some women, the hair growth may return.","Treatment can help cure or lessen the effects of hirsutism. There also are things you can do at home to conceal the appearance of hair growth.

• Shaving: This is the safest and easiest method to remove unwanted hair. It also is inexpensive. However, you may have to shave every day. Otherwise, your hair grows back quickly. Frequent shaving can irritate your skin. You can apply a small amount of 1% hydrocortisone cream.
• Tweezing and waxing: Tweezing is good for removing a few stray hairs. Waxing is more effective for removing large patches of hair. It can cause brief discomfort and skin irritation.
• Bleaching: This can lighten the color of your unwanted hair to make it harder to see. Follow the directions on the product label. Bleaching can irritate your skin or cause discoloring.
• Topical creams, lotions, and gels: These products can break down your hair follicles over time. However, they can take a while to work and may not be successful. You may be allergic to the chemicals in the products. To test how sensitive your skin is, apply a small amount of cream to the inside of your wrist. Wait one day before applying the cream to other parts of your body. If you have a reaction to the cream, do not use it. Talk to your doctor about other options.

If you are overweight, try to lose weight and eat a healthy diet. Some women find that this helps to balance their hormones.

Women who have hirsutism may have self-esteem issues. The hair growth can be emotional and hard to deal with. It may help to get counseling or join a support group. You can ask your doctor for a recommendation.","• What is the likely cause of my hirsutism?
• What is the best treatment option for me?
• Do I need to take medicine? If so, for how long?
• What are the side effects of treatment?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to balance out my hormone levels?
• I’m embarrassed by the excess hair on my face and body. What can I do about it?","Hormone Health Network: Hirsutism

205,HIV,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hiv/,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the body’s immune system. A healthy immune system is what keeps you from getting sick.

When HIV damages your immune system, you are more likely to get sick from bacteria and viruses. It is also harder for your body to fight off these infections when you do get them, so you may have trouble getting better.

AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is the term used when persons have advanced HIV disease. This increases your risk for infections and other serious HIV-associated conditions. With treatment, most Americans who have HIV are unlikely to develop AIDS.","When first infected with HIV, you may not experience any symptoms. More often, though, you’ll have flu-like symptoms, including:

• Fever
• Headache
• Fatigue
• Swollen lymph nodes (lymph glands)
• Sore throat

As the disease progresses, symptoms may appear and/or get worse. This may take time. Some people who have HIV do not begin experiencing symptoms for up to 10 years. When HIV symptoms do appear, they can include:

• Swollen lymph nodes (lymph glands)
• Diarrhea
• Fever
• Cough
• Shortness of breath
• Unintended weight loss","HIV can only be passed from person to person through infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, and vaginal fluid.

Children born to people with HIV can also acquire HIV during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding. However, this happens less often now. It can be prevented by giving medicines to the pregnant person and to their newborn baby.

The most common ways HIV is passed are:

• By having unprotected (without using a condom) anal, vaginal, or oral sex with a person who has HIV
• By sharing drug-use equipment (needles or syringes) for injecting drugs with a person who has HIV

You are more at risk for HIV if you:

• Have multiple sex partners
• Have sex with a person who trades sex for money or other items
• Share needles using illegal injected drugs
• Exchange sex for drugs or money
• Have a sexually transmitted infection
• Currently have or did have a sexual partner with any of the above risk factors
• Are a man who has sex with other men",null,"The best way to prevent HIV is to not have sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with a person who has HIV, or share a needle with a person who has HIV. However, there is also a medicine called PrEP that people can take before coming into contact with HIV that can prevent them from getting an HIV infection.

PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is for people who are at long-term risk of getting HIV either through sexual activity or by injecting drugs. If you’re taking PrEP and come into contact with HIV, the medicine makes it difficult for HIV to develop inside your body.

Other ways to prevent HIV include:

• When you have sex, practice “safer” sex by using a condom. The best condom is a male latex condom. A female condom is not as effective but does offer some protection.
• Do not share needles and syringes.
• Never let someone else’s blood, semen, urine, vaginal fluid, or feces get into your anus, vagina, or mouth.","Even though there is no cure for HIV, there are many medicines available to help combat it. These medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) will often prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. Even when HIV does progress to AIDS, antiretroviral therapy is often still effective. However, it is most effective the earlier you begin treatment.

Better ART has changed HIV disease from the leading killer of young adults to a chronic disease that can be controlled for decades. However, even though you can take HIV medicines and feel okay, you could still give the virus to others through unsafe sex (without using a condom) or blood exchanges. The medicines don’t kill the virus — they just keep your immune system strong enough to prevent AIDS or slow it down.

With treatment, the survival rate for HIV is very good. In the United States, people with HIV who are diagnosed early can have a life span that is about the same as someone like them who does not have HIV, according to HIV.gov.","If you are living with HIV, you need to take very good care of yourself. Be sure to eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and get plenty of rest. Make sure you follow your doctor’s instructions and take all of your medicines exactly as directed. You can also take steps to keep yourself from getting other infections or diseases that are more common in people who have HIV.

It is also important to see your doctor regularly so that he or she can monitor your treatment. Your doctor will probably want to see you every 6 months as long as your CD4 cell count is good. If it drops below 500, your doctor may want to see you every 3 months. Your doctor also may want to see you more often if you are trying a new medicine to see how you’re responding to it. It is important to make sure your HIV infection is not getting worse.

Some of the things that might tell your doctor that your HIV infection has gotten worse since your last visit are:

• New symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, headache, chills, night sweats, cough, shortness of breath or diarrhea
• Signs of weight loss, mouth sores (ulcers), thrush (a yeast infection of the mouth and tongue), or bigger lymph nodes (glands located in your neck, armpits and hip area)
• A drop in the CD4 cell count in your blood
• A rise in the viral load in your blood

You should also proactively try to prevent other infections and complications. HIV can increase your risk for other diseases and conditions because it weakens your immune system. Here are some things you can do to help protect yourself.

• A flu shot every fall helps prevent the flu.
• A periodic pneumonia shot can prevent pneumonia caused by the bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. It’s easier for people who have HIV to get this kind of pneumonia. Your doctor will review your immunization history to determine when you need to get these shots.
• A tuberculosis (TB) skin test every year can tell if you have TB. TB is a very serious illness, especially in people who have HIV.
• A Pap test for women checks for dysplasia (a pre-cancer condition) and for cancer of the cervix. Both of these conditions occur more often in women who have HIV infection. At first, Pap tests are done every 6 months. After 2 Pap tests in a row are normal, you might only have to get them once a year.

All persons with HIV should also be tested for, and immunized against, hepatitis B.","• Is there any sure way to avoid acquiring HIV?
• What is the best treatment for me?
• How can I avoid getting any infections that will make me very sick?
• How can I find support groups in my community?
• What diagnostic tests will you run?
• How often will I need to see my doctor?
• Will there be any side effects to my treatment?
• How does this affect my plans for having a family?
• Is it safe for me to breastfeed my baby?
• Will using a condom keep my sex partners from acquiring HIV?
• Should I follow a special diet?","CDC National AIDS Prevention Hotline

207,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),https://familydoctor.org/condition/human-papillomavirus-hpv/,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted virus. It is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. There are more than 200 types of HPV. Some types don’t cause any symptoms. Other types cause genital warts. More aggressive kinds of HPV can cause cancer in both women and men. This includes cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat.

HPV is passed between people through genital or skin-to-skin contact. Both men and women can get HPV and pass it on. Often, they don’t know they have it, so they don’t realize they are passing it to other people. Nearly all people who have had sex will get HPV at some point in their lives.","In most cases, HPV—including the kinds that cause cancer—does not have symptoms. The main symptom people see with some types of HPV infection is genital warts. Genital warts can be small or large, flat or raised. Sometimes they are described as looking like cauliflower. There can be just one, or they can appear in groups. They can appear on the anus, cervix, scrotum, penis, groin, or thigh.

Another type of HPV can cause warts to develop on other parts of your body, such as your hands and feet. The types of HPV that cause warts generally do not cause cancer.","Infection from HPV happens when the virus gets into your body. This most often happens during vaginal, anal, or oral sex with a person who is already infected. HPV is spread through skin-to-skin contact, not through bodily fluids.","If you think you have warts in your genital area, call your family doctor. They will be able to diagnose it with an examination.

For women, diagnosis of HPV often starts with abnormal results from a routine Pap test. When you have a Pap test (or “smear”), the doctor will take a sample of cells from your cervix. The sample is sent to a lab and looked at under a microscope. If abnormal cells are found, your doctor may do another Pap test and include a cervical HPV test. This test can identify many of the HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. This is the only HPV test approved by the FDA.

If you have a type of HPV that can cause cancer, your doctor may want to perform a colposcopy. In this test, he or she will use a special magnifying lens to get a closer look at your cervix. If the tissue looks abnormal, they will cut out a small bit to perform a biopsy. This test will check for signs of cancer.

There is no FDA-approved test for HPV for men. Men who have sex with other men or are HIV-positive might be a candidate for an anal Pap test. This test will not confirm HPV, but it can find abnormal skin cells.","Because HPV is such a common virus, it is hard to avoid it completely. But there are steps you can take to lower your risk.

• Have few sex partners.
• Avoid sex with people who have had many sex partners.
• Use condoms consistently and correctly, though they may not cover all areas of skin where the virus lives.
• Get vaccinated.

HPV often shows no symptoms. Sometimes symptoms show up weeks or months after you’ve been infected. This makes it harder for you to not spread the infection. It is less common for men to develop complications from HPV. But they can spread the virus to women, where cancer from the virus is more common. Therefore, it is important to do your best to avoid HPV.","There is no cure or treatment for the virus itself. In many men and women, HPV goes away on its own without causing any health problems. There are treatments for the conditions the virus causes. These include genital warts, precancerous cells, and cancer.

Genital warts must be treated by your doctor. Do not try to treat the warts yourself. Don’t use over-the-counter wart-removal products. These chemicals are not supposed to be used for genital warts. They can irritate the skin.

If precancerous cells are found, your doctor may want to monitor the area to make sure it doesn’t grow. Your doctor may recommend to remove the abnormal tissue so it doesn’t turn into cancer. If cancer is found, treatment will vary. It will depend on the type of cancer, the stage, and the patient’s age.","You may test positive for HPV without having signs of cancer or genital warts. Your doctor will likely want you to get a repeat Pap test to monitor things until the infection is gone. This could take up to 2 years.

Most women who get their routine Pap tests and follow their doctor’s advice will not get cervical cancer. It takes a long time to develop, and regular check-ups help find issues early, before they get more serious.","• What treatment is best for me?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says girls and boys between the ages of 11 and 12 should get the vaccine. It is most effective when the person is vaccinated before becoming sexually active. Teenagers and young adults can get the vaccine, too. It is approved for anyone between 9 years and 26 years of age.

The CDC also recommends the vaccine for men 26 and under who have sex with other men or are HIV-positive.

The vaccine is given in multiple doses (shots) over 6 to 12 months. Children ages 9 to 14 receive 2 doses. Those 15 or older receive 3 doses. It’s important to get all of the doses to make sure you or your child are getting the most protection from HPV infection.

Without health insurance, vaccines can be expensive. The CDC’s Vaccines for Children (VFC) program provides free vaccines for some families. If you have low income and don’t have insurance for vaccinations, you might qualify."
208,Huntington's Disease | Symptoms and treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/huntingtons-disease/,"Huntington’s disease is a rare, progressive brain disorder that gradually kills nerve cells in the brain. This damage slowly reduces a person’s physical and mental abilities over time. The disease is genetic, meaning a person inherits it from their parents. It has no cure and is always fatal.

People inherit the defective gene that causes Huntington’s disease at birth, but symptoms usually don’t appear until middle age. Doctors diagnose most cases between the ages of 30 and 50. An early-onset form, called juvenile Huntington’s disease, affects people younger than 20.","There are many symptoms of Huntington’s disease. Early signs include:

• Irritability
• Depression
• Poor coordination
• Small involuntary body movements
• Trouble making decisions
• Trouble learning new information

Huntington’s disease is progressive. That means it gets worse over time. Living with the disorder means preparing for the symptoms to worsen. Eventually you will need help with everyday activities. These include getting around your home, hygiene, eating, and decision-making. A trusted advisor can help with important decisions and in monitoring changes in your behavior.

People with Huntington’s disease usually die within 15 to 20 years of their diagnosis. The most common causes of death are infections (such as pneumonia) and injuries related to falls.

It is passed on from parent to child at the time the child is conceived. If one parent carries the defective gene, the child has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and developing the disease. If the child does not inherit the defective gene, he or she will not develop the disease.","Doctors use a variety of tools to diagnose Huntington’s disease. They will start with a physical exam to observe your symptoms. They will ask questions about symptoms and your family medical history. A brain imaging test, such as CT or MRI, can show abnormalities in the brain. A lab can detect the Huntington’s disease gene with a simple blood test.",Huntington’s disease is a genetic disorder. It cannot be prevented or avoided.,"There is no cure for Huntington’s disease. Nothing can stop or reverse the disease’s course. The goal of treatment is to help relieve symptoms. This will help you function for as long as possible.

There is no single treatment for the disorder. Medicines can be used to treat some symptoms. For example, some “antipsychotic” medicines can help with uncontrollable body movements.

Medicines used for treating uncontrolled body movement generally have side effects. They may make you nauseated, sleepy, or restless. Movement disorder medicines also may worsen other symptoms associated with Huntington’s disease, such as rigid muscles.

Adapting your everyday life to the symptoms of the disorder is necessary. Different therapies can help. You may require:

• Physical therapy, such as walking
• Occupational therapy (activities using your hands)
• Speech therapies (to help with slurred speech or trouble swallowing)

You also may require assistance at home for activities of daily living. These could include cooking, cleaning, and everyday chores. As the disorder progresses, you may need help in dressing, eating, and toileting. There may come a time that you need 24-hour care.",null,"• To avoid passing Huntington’s disease onto your children, should every parent have a routine genetics test even if they don’t have symptoms?

• Jerking or twitching movements you can’t control (called chorea)
• Trouble walking, speaking, and swallowing
• Changes in personality
• Decline in thinking and reasoning abilities
• Significant weight loss

In young people, symptoms include being unsteady on your feet, rigid muscles, slurred speech, and seizures. As thinking and reasoning abilities get worse, school performance also gets worse. Juvenile Huntington’s disease tends to progress faster than the adult-onset form of the disease."
209,Hypercoagulation,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hypercoagulation/,"When you get a cut, your body forms a thickened mass of blood tissue called a blood clot. This mass stops the bleeding. Proteins in your blood help form the clot. This process is called coagulation.

Sometimes your blood clots too much. This is called hypercoagulation. A blood clot can then travel through your body in your blood. This can be very dangerous. Blood clots can form in vital organs or travel to them, including the heart and brain. This can cause serious health problems, even death.","The symptoms you may experience depend on where the blood clot forms and where it travels. It can travel to many places, including the heart, lungs, brain, legs, and kidneys.

A blood clot in the heart or lungs can cause a heart attack or a pulmonary embolism (a name for blood clot in the lungs). Symptoms include:

• Chest pain.
• Shortness of breath.
• Discomfort in the upper body, including chest, back, neck, or arms.

A blood clot in the brain can cause a stroke. Symptoms include:

• Headache.
• Speech changes.
• Dizziness.
• Paralysis on one or both sides of the body.

A blood clot in the lower body may cause deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot deep inside your leg) or peripheral artery disease (when your arteries become narrow). Symptoms may appear in your leg and include:

• redness
• warmth
• swelling

A blood clot in the vein to one of your kidneys may cause kidney failure. Symptoms include:

• Urinating less than usual.
• Blood in the urine.
• Lower back pain.
• A blood clot in the lung.","Some people may not have enough of the proteins that regulate blood clotting. This causes their blood to clot too often. Others may have the proteins but have issues with them not working right. Still others are born with a tendency to develop clots. This means they run in the family.

Certain situations or risk factors can make it more likely for your blood to clot too much. These situations include:

• Sitting on an airplane or in a car for a long time.
• Prolonged bed rest (several days or weeks at a time), such as after surgery or during a long hospital stay.
• Surgery (which can slow blood flow).
• Cancer (some types of cancerincrease the proteins that clot your blood).
• Pregnancy (which increases the pressure in your pelvis and legs and can make blood clots form).
• Using birth control pills or receiving hormone replacement therapy (which can slow blood flow).
• Smoking.

In addition to these situations, you may be at risk of hypercoagulation if:

• You have relatives with abnormal or excessive clotting.
• You had an abnormal clot at a young age.
• You got clots when you were pregnant, were using birth control pills, or were being treated with hormone replacement therapy.
• You have had multiple unexplained miscarriages.","If your doctor suspects you have hypercoagulation, he or she will do a physical exam. Your doctor will ask if anyone in your family has or had problems with clotting. He or she also can order blood tests to check the protein and platelet levels in your blood. The tests also can show if your proteins are working the way they should.","There is nothing you can do to prevent hypercoagulation if it’s inherited (runs in your family). However, there are some things you can do to reduce your risk if it isn’t inherited.

• Quit smoking.
• Maintain a healthy weight.
• Avoid medicines that contain the female hormone estrogen (such as birth control pills).
• Stay active during long trips. If traveling by car, take frequent breaks to get out and walk. If traveling by plane, walk up and down the aisles every hour. These activities will keep the blood flowing.
• Treat conditions that could lead to excessive clotting, such as diabetes.","Hypercoagulation is usually treated with medicine. Most of the time, this medicine is called an anticoagulant. This is sometimes called a blood thinner. Some drug names you may hear are heparin, warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivoraxaban, and aspirin. This medicine makes it hard for blood clots to form. It also can keep existing clots from growing bigger.

Some people only need to take this medicine when they’re in situations that make them more likely to form clots. This can include during long car or airplane trips, when they’re pregnant, or when they’re recovering from surgery in the hospital. Other people need to take this medicine on a regular basis for the rest of their lives. Your doctor will decide what treatment is right for you.

If your doctor prescribes an anticoagulant, you should:

• Follow his or her instructions carefully. This includes how, when and how much of the medicine to take. It also includes getting follow-up blood tests so your doctor can see how the medicine is working.
• Discuss your diet with your doctor if you take warfarin. Foods with a lot of vitamin K can reduce its effectiveness. These foods include leafy green vegetables, fish, lentils, soybeans, and some vegetable oils.
• Don’t take aspirin with other blood thinners unless your doctor tells you it’s okay. Aspirin also can thin your blood.
• Talk with your doctor before taking any other medicines or supplements. This includes prescription medicine, over-the-counter medicine, vitamins, or herbal supplements. Some of these medicines may strengthen or weaken your anticoagulant.
• If you have other doctors, tell them you’re taking an anticoagulant.
• Tell your doctor right away if you’re pregnant or become pregnant. Some anticoagulants can cause birth defects.
• Tell your family you take anticoagulant medicine.
• Carry an emergency medical ID card with you at all times.

Anticoagulants can have side effects. Some can cause you to bleed easily. For example, if you cut yourself, it might take your blood longer than usual to clot. You might also bruise more easily. Call your doctor right away if you have bleeding that’s unusual or heavy.",Hypercoagulation can be extremely dangerous. A blood clot inside a blood vessel can travel through your bloodstream. It can get stuck inside one of your body’s organs. A clot that gets stuck in your lungs (pulmonary embolism) blocks blood from getting to your lungs. A clot that blocks a blood vessel in the brain can cause a stroke. A clot in a blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart attack. Blood clots can cause some women to have miscarriages. All of these conditions can be life-threatening. That’s why it’s so important for hypercoagulation to be treated right away.,"• Is hypercoagulation dangerous? Am I at risk of a stroke?

210,Hyperhidrosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hyperhidrosis/,"Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating. Everyone sweats when they’re hot, exercising, or feeling stress. But people who have hyperhidrosis sweat most of the time and sweat heavily without the usual triggers.","If you have hyperhidrosis, you may sweat all over your body. Or you may sweat mainly on your hands, feet, armpits, face, and genital area. Your clothes may be soaked with sweat. Your skin may become white and wrinkled or red and irritated from the moisture.

Dampness from the sweat is accompanied by odor. Sweat by itself doesn’t usually have an odor. But once it is on your skin, bacteria and other germs begin to break it down. This causes it to smell.

Hyperhidrosis can have an unpleasant effect on your life. You may feel awkward and uncomfortable in social situations. You may be self-conscious because of dampness and odor. You may also be afraid to touch or shake hands with people or raise your arm to reach for something. You may feel embarrassed about being in public, spending time with your friends, and going to work or school. These are very normal reactions to having hyperhidrosis.","There are 2 types of hyperhidrosis.

Primary hyperhidrosis: This is called focal hyperhidrosis. It tends to affect both sides of the body. It occurs on the feet, hands, underarms, head, and face. Sometimes, it affects larger areas of the body. It seems to run in families, often begins in childhood, and occurs during waking hours. It is usually very hard to determine the cause of primary hyperhidrosis.

More often, hyperhidrosis is caused by something else. This is called secondary hyperhidrosis or generalized hyperhidrosis. It tends to involve large areas of the body and may happen both during the day and at night. Secondary hyperhidrosis may be caused by:

• Anxiety
• Hormonal changes (such as menopause)
• Problems with blood sugar control
• An overactive thyroid
• Heart disease
• Cancer
• Certain infections or other conditions
• Caffeine
• Certain medicines, such as aspirin, some blood pressure medicines, and antidepressants
• Certain substances of abuse
• Glucose control disorders
• Lung disease
• Parkinson disease
• Adrenal gland tumor
• Spinal cord injury
• Stroke
• Tuberculosis or other infections","Your doctor will probably ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. The signs of hyperhidrosis may be obvious to your doctor and no testing may be needed. You may also be checked for other problems that could be causing your symptoms. For example, your doctor may order urine and blood tests to check for conditions such as an overactive thyroid or low blood sugar. Additional testing for hyperhidrosis measures the level of moisture on your skin.","You cannot prevent primary hyperhidrosis. Often, you cannot prevent secondary hyperhidrosis. Much depends on what is causing your symptoms. If your symptoms are caused by blood pressure medicine, it may be possible to change medicines. If your symptoms are caused by caffeine, they may go away when you stop drinking caffeinated drinks. But if your symptoms are caused by heart disease or cancer, it may be impossible to prevent hyperhidrosis.","• Antiperspirants. If regular antiperspirants haven’t helped, try a product with a higher level of aluminum chloride hexahydrate (brand names: Certain Dri, Drysol, Hypercare, Xerac). This ingredient shuts down sweat ducts. You may try a product from the store or you may talk to your doctor about a prescription. Apply these antiperspirants at night to towel-dried skin several times a week. Your doctor may suggest you apply it every night or even twice a day for the first week. After that, apply it once or twice a week to keep your sweating under control.
• Prescription medicines for hyperhidrosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to stop stimulation of the sweat glands. This medicine may have side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurry vision. Taking it over time may lead to more serious problems. Talk to your doctor to see if this medicine might be useful to you.
• Medicine to treat the cause of secondary hyperhidrosis. If you have secondary hyperhidrosis caused by another condition, medicine that treats that condition may help. For example, if stress is part of what triggers you to sweat heavily, then medicine to treat anxiety may be useful to you.
• Iontophoresis. This treatment option involves using a special machine that applies low amounts of electricity to shut off the sweat glands. This treatment generally is used for hands and feet.
• Botulinum toxin type A (brand name: Botox). This treatment is typically injected into the armpits to block the nerves that cause sweating. Botox can work well but can be expensive and painful. Also, it sometimes causes flu-like symptoms. Each treatment is effective for about 4 to 8 months.
• If your hyperhidrosis is severe and other treatments haven’t worked, surgery may be an option. A surgeon may remove or cut nerves that activate certain sweat glands. Or they may remove some sweat glands completely. Typically, surgery is a last resort. Many people who go through surgery have new or worsened sweating (called compensatory sweating) later in life. Surgery also carries the risk of nerve and artery damage.","A number of things can help you deal with hyperhidrosis day to day.

• If you are bothered by odor, try bathing daily with antibacterial soap. This will help wash away the bacteria and other germs that gather on the skin, which are what can cause odor when you sweat.
• Dry yourself completely. Bacteria and other germs thrive in damp areas.
• Let your shoes dry completely before wearing them again. Do not wear the same pair of shoes 2 days in a row.
• Wear cotton socks or socks that pull moisture away from the skin. Change your socks throughout the day if needed.
• Cotton and other natural fibers may help you feel cooler and give you the sense that your skin can breathe. But when you exercise, special fabrics designed to pull dampness away from your skin might be most comfortable.
• Wear dress shields. These are pads you can place under your arms. They may be useful and help you feel more confident that you won’t sweat through your shirt or blouse.
• Some people find that keeping an extra shirt or pair of socks on hand helps them feel more secure about being in public. Doing this gives you the option to change if your clothes become damp and you feel uncomfortable.
• Keep up with your laundry. Be sure to wash and dry clothing thoroughly before wearing again.
• Try shaving in bothersome areas, such as under the arms.
• If certain foods or drinks seem to make your sweating worse, avoid them. This might include caffeine, spicy foods, and alcohol.
• Relaxation techniques might be helpful (such as yoga and meditation), especially if your sweating is triggered by stress. Even if the sweating isn’t triggered directly by stress, the sweating itself can cause stress, so relaxation techniques can be helpful.","• What is the likely cause of my hyperhidrosis?
• I’m embarrassed by how much I sweat. Will a prescription antiperspirant help?
• What is the best treatment option for me? Will I need to take medicine?
• Do I need to make any lifestyle changes?
• When can I expect relief from my symptoms?
• Is hyperhidrosis a sign of a more serious health problem?
• Do I need any tests?","International Hyperhidrosis Society

211,Hyperparathyroidism,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hyperparathyroidism/,"Hyperparathyroidism occurs in your parathyroid glands. These are the 4 pea-sized glands behind your thyroid gland at the front of your neck. The glands make a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). The hormone manages the levels of calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus in your body. PTH helps you absorb calcium from your food and keeps you from losing too much calcium through your urine.

People who have hyperparathyroidism produce too much PTH. This causes them to have too much calcium in their bloodstream and not enough in their bones. In general, hyperparathyroidism affects the health of your bones and kidneys, but has the potential to affect your overall health.","Hyperparathyroidism does not always produce early symptoms. Some people may have one or more of the following symptoms:

• Feeling weak or tired most of the time
• General aches and pains
• Stomach pain
• Frequent heartburn (the high calcium level in your blood can cause your stomach to make too much acid)
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Loss of appetite
• Constipation
• Bone and joint pain
• An increase in bone fractures or breaks
• Confusion and memory loss
• Kidney stones
• Excessive urination
• High blood pressure","A number of things can cause your parathyroid glands to make too much PTH. These include:

• A benign (non-cancerous) growth on your parathyroid glands known as an adenoma
• Enlargement of 2 or more of the parathyroid glands
• A medical condition, such as kidney failure or rickets
• Radiation to your neck or head
• A rare inherited condition of the parathyroid gland

Hyperparathyroidism also can be hereditary, which means it runs in families. More women have hyperparathyroidism than men. It is more likely to occur in older adults and women who have gone through menopause. People who lack vitamin D are at an increased risk. This is because vitamin D helps your body absorb the calcium in your bloodstream. In rare instances, people exposed to chronic lithium therapy (typically prescribed to treat bipolar disorder) also are at an increased risk.","Most cases of hyperparathyroidism are found during routine blood tests. This is because most people do not have or recognize symptoms. When the doctor does a blood test, they will check your calcium level. If it is high, they will look at the amount of PTH in your blood.

Once the doctor confirms the diagnosis, they may run more tests. These can help find the cause of the condition. A CT scan or ultrasound checks for growths on your parathyroid glands. Those test in different body areas also can check for calcium deposits in your kidneys and urinary tract. Other causes of increased calcium, such as some medicines or cancer, must be considered as well.",You cannot prevent or avoid hyperparathyroidism.,"Treatment for hyperparathyroidism depends on the cause. If you have a growth on your parathyroid gland, you likely will need surgery. Once the doctor removes the growth, it shouldn’t come back. Your symptoms should stop in the first month after surgery. Your blood calcium level may be too low at first. This can be treated with medicine. Surgery also may be recommended for people who have moderate to severe symptoms. The doctor will remove the glands that are overactive.

If you have minor or no symptoms, medicine may be the best form of treatment. Medicines can treat some but not all of the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.

If a medical condition is the cause, treatment is aimed at managing the underlying condition.

Talk to your doctor about treatment options if you are pregnant. You do not want your baby to be calcium deficient. This is very harmful to their development.","Most people feel much better after treatment once the symptoms have gone away. Your doctor will want to continue routine testing. A blood test checks your calcium and PTH levels. A bone X-ray or bone mineral density (DXA) test can check for bone loss. Other tests may be done as needed based on the cause.

It is very important to maintain your blood calcium level as much as possible. Normally, the amount of calcium going into your bones matches the amount of calcium passing out of your bones. If you have hyperparathyroidism, more calcium is coming out of your bones than is going back in. This can lead to decreased bone mass. Weak bones break more easily and heal slower than normal bones.

The calcium from your bones enters your bloodstream and causes too much calcium in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. You also can get kidney stones, because your kidneys are trying to filter out the extra calcium in your blood.

If you have hyperparathyroidism, you should not have too much or too little calcium in your diet. Aim for about 800-1,000 mg each day. You also should limit your intake of vitamin D to less than 600 IU each day. Your doctor can give you more information about your intake of these nutrients. Drink plenty of water to help prevent kidney stones. Regular exercise helps to build bone strength. Do not smoke. It increases your risk for certain problems, including bone loss.","• What is the likely cause of my hyperparathyroidism?

212,Hyperthyroidism,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hyperthyroidism/,"Hyperthyroidism is known as overactive thyroid. It occurs when your thyroid gland makes and releases too much thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly. It is in the front of your neck, below your Adam’s apple. The thyroid makes hormones that control your body’s metabolism. It affects your heart rate and the function of your other organs. It also affects your muscles, bones, and menstrual cycles (for women).

Hyperthyroidism can be related to Graves’ disease. This is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland.","Hyperthyroidism often begins slowly. Its symptoms can be mistaken for stress or other health problems. Common symptoms include:

• Unplanned weight loss
• Rapid heartbeat, abnormal heartbeat, or pounding of the heart
• Nervousness, anxiety, or touchiness
• Tremors (trembling of the hands and fingers)
• Changes in menstrual patterns, such as lighter flow or less frequent periods, in women
• Increased sensitivity to heat
• Increased sweating
• Bowel changes
• An enlarged thyroid gland (called a goiter), which can appear as swelling at the base of the neck
• Fatigue
• Muscle weakness
• Trouble sleeping
• Increased appetite

Symptoms in older adults may be subtle. Examples are increased heart rate, fatigue during normal activities, and withdrawal. Doctors may mistake hyperthyroidism for depression or dementia.

People who have Graves’ disease may have additional symptoms. One of the most common symptoms is swollen or bulging eyes. This can cause your eyes to be dry and red. You may also have:

• Tearing
• Blurry or double vision
• Sensitivity to light","In more than 70% of cases, hyperthyroidism is caused by Graves’ disease. Normally, the immune system helps protect your body against viruses, bacteria, and other substances. An autoimmune disease causes it to attack your body’s tissues and/or organs. With Graves’ disease, the immune system stimulates your thyroid, making it produce too much hormone. Doctors think Graves’ disease may run in families. It is most common among young women.

Two other common causes for hyperthyroidism are:

• Hyperfunctioning (overactive) thyroid nodules. One or more nodules or lumps in the thyroid grow. This increases the production of the thyroid hormone.
• A problem with the immune system or a viral infection causes the thyroid gland to become inflamed. This causes extra thyroid hormone to leak into your bloodstream. Thyroiditis could lead to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) over time.

Consuming foods or medicines that contain high levels of iodine can also lead to hyperthyroidism. In rare cases, the cause could be a benign (noncancerous) tumor on the pituitary gland.","Contact your doctor if you have symptoms of an overactive thyroid. He or she will check for an enlarged thyroid gland, rapid pulse, moist skin, eye changes, and a slight tremor in your fingers or hand. Your doctor also will do a blood test to measure the amount of thyroid hormone in your blood. This confirms the diagnosis.

Your doctor may do a thyroid scan to find the cause. If your entire thyroid is affected, you have Graves’ disease. Or the doctor will look for thyroid nodules or an inflammation.

Your doctor also may do a radioactive iodine uptake test. This test measures your thyroid’s ability to take up iodine. A high uptake of iodine means your thyroid gland may be producing too much hormone. This indicates Graves’ disease or a hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule. A low uptake of iodine indicates thyroiditis as the cause.","You cannot prevent hyperthyroidism. However, some people are more at risk for the condition. This includes people who:

• Were born female
• Have a family history of thyroid disease
• Are younger than 40 or older than 60
• Have certain problems, such as type 1 diabetes, pernicious anemia, or an immune system disorder
• Consume large amounts of iodine, either through food or medicine","There are several treatments for hyperthyroidism. The best one for you depends on your age, health, cause, and the severity of your condition. The goal is to control your thyroid levels and make them normal. Doing this relieves symptoms and prevents future health problems. Treatments include:

• Radioactive iodine. You take a pill or liquid by mouth. It gets into your blood stream and destroys the overactive thyroid cells. This causes the level of thyroid hormone in your body to decrease. Symptoms often lessen in 3 to 6 months. The result is permanent low thyroid activity (hypothyroidism). This condition can be treated with thyroid supplements. Despite concerns about radioactive material, the treatment has been used for more than 60 years without any problems. Most adults in the United States who have hyperthyroidism are treated with radioactive iodine. This option is not suitable for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
• Anti-thyroid medicine. These drugs tell your thyroid to produce fewer hormones. Symptoms begin to improve in 6 to 12 weeks as your hormone levels adjust. Treatment can last for at least a year. This is a better option for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor about possible side effects.
• Surgery. A thyroidectomy is when the doctor removes most of your thyroid gland. After surgery, you likely will develop hypothyroidism. You can take thyroid supplements to restore your hormone levels to normal.
• Beta blockers. These drugs slow your heart rate and reduce tremors and anxiety. They can be used with other forms of treatment. You should be able to stop taking them once your thyroid levels return to normal.","If it is not treated, hyperthyroidism can lead to other health problems. These include:

• Heart problems. A rapid heart rate, a heart rhythm disorder (called atrial fibrillation), or congestive heart failure can result.
• Brittle bones (osteoporosis). Too much thyroid hormone can prevent your body from absorbing calcium into your bones. You can get calcium in your food, or your doctor may recommend a calcium supplement.
• Thyrotoxic crisis. A sudden worsening of hyperthyroidism symptoms that leads to a fever, rapid pulse, and delirium. Signs of delirium include decreased awareness, confusion, and restlessness. See a doctor right away if this occurs.
• Infertility. Too much thyroid hormone can make it hard for some women to get pregnant. An overactive thyroid also can be harmful to the mother and baby during pregnancy. Most doctors test women’s thyroid hormone levels at this stage.

People who have Graves’ disease may develop red, swollen skin on their shins and feet. Try using over-the-counter creams with hydrocortisone for relief. You also may have eye problems due to Graves’ ophthalmopathy. To relieve these symptoms:

• Apply a cool compress to your eyes.
• Wear sunglasses.
• Use lubricating eye drops.
• Elevate the head of your bed to reduce blood flow to your head.","• What is the cause of my hyperthyroidism?

213,Hypopituitarism,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hypopituitarism/,"Hypopituitarism is a disorder in which your body doesn’t make enough hormones from the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small, bean-shaped gland at the base of your brain. It plays a role in controlling your body’s endocrine system. The endocrine system is a group of glands that produce and secrete hormones to regulate your body’s processes.

In hypopituitarism, the pituitary gland fails to produce or doesn’t produce enough of one or more of its hormones. When your pituitary gland doesn’t produce enough hormones, your body functions are affected.

The pituitary gland is responsible for releasing:

• Adrenocoricotropichormone (ACTH).This stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and other hormones to help your body deal with stress.
• Anti-diuretic hormone.This controls urine
• Follicle-stimulating hormone.This works with luteinizing hormone to stimulate sperm production from the testes in men. It stimulates egg development and ovulation in women.
• Growth hormone.This controls bone and tissue growth. It also maintains the balance of fat and muscle tissue in the body.
• Luteinizing hormone.This controls testosterone production in men and estrogen in women.
• This causes the uterus to contract during childbirth. It also causes the breast to release milk (in women).
• This controls the development of breasts and the production of breast milk in women.
• Thyroid-stimulating hormone.This stimulates your thyroid gland to make other hormones that regulate your body’s metabolism.

It’s possible for the","symptoms of hypopituitarism to appear suddenly. But it’s much more common for them to develop over time. Because of this, they’re often overlooked for months or years.

• Abdominal discomfort
• Constipation
• Facial puffiness
• Fatigue
• Headaches
• Hoarse voice
• Low blood pressure
• Loss of appetite
• Loss of underarm and pubic hair
• Low interest in sex (men and women)
• Muscle weakness
• Nausea
• Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warm
• Stiffness in the joints
• Thirst and excessive urination
• Unintended weight loss or gain
• Vision problems

• Erectile dysfunction
• Decrease in facial or body hair
• Loss of interest in sexual activity

• Inability to produce milk for breast-feeding
• Infertility
• Irregular or stopped menstrual periods

• Stunted growth, which may result in short stature
• Slowed sexual development

You should see a doctor immediately if certain symptoms of hypopituitarism develop suddenly. These include:

• Severe headache
• Visual problems
• Confusion
• Drop in blood pressure

Sudden onset of these symptoms could be a sign of sudden bleeding into the pituitary. This is called pituitary apoplexy, which is a serious condition.","Hypopituitarism is commonly caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland. A tumor can squeeze the pituitary gland as it grows, which can cause damage. A pituitary tumor can also put pressure on the optic nerves in the eyes and cause visual problems.

Other causes of hypopituitarism are:

• Brain tumor
• Brain surgery
• Head injuries
• Infections of the brain, such as meningitis
• Radiation treatment to the brain
• Stroke
• Tuberculosis
• Uncommon diseases, such as sarcoidosis and histiocytosis X

Hypopituitarism can also be caused by diseases of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a portion of the brain located just above the pituitary gland. It’s responsible for producing hormones that help the pituitary gland function normally.

In other cases, the cause of hypopituitarism may be unknown.","If you have symptoms of hypopituitarism, your doctor may order blood tests to check your hormone levels. Or you doctor may want to check for pituitary tumors or defects. This is done using a computerized tomography (CT) scan or for more detail and smaller concerns, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain. Your doctor may do several vision tests to see if your sight is being affected. In children, X-rays can measure whether bones are growing normally.

Your doctor may also want you to see an endocrinologist. This is a doctor who studies the endocrine system. You may need to go to a special endocrine clinic for other tests.","In most cases, you can’t prevent this disorder. Some medicines can suppress pituitary function. This can cause hypopituitarism. Ask your doctor about these risks if you’re taking glucocorticoids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone).","Your doctor will treat the condition that’s causing your hypopituitarism first. This can help restore your pituitary gland’s ability to produce hormones.

If a tumor on your pituitary gland is causing your hypopituitarism, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove it. Or they may recommend radiation therapy to shrink it.

Sometimes, even after treatment, your body doesn’t produce enough of one or more pituitary hormones. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe a hormone replacement medicine to add to your body’s hormone production.

Hormone replacement medicines include:

• Corticosteroids(such as prednisone and hydrocortisone). This medicine replaces hormones missing because of an adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency.
• Desmopressin (DDAVP).This medicine replaces adrenocoricotropic hormones missing because of an anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. It also helps reduce your body’s loss of water through frequent urination.
• Growth hormone(also called somatropin). This promotes growth in children and benefits adults who have a growth hormone deficiency.
• This replaces thyroid hormones missing because of a thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency.
• Sex hormones.These replace testosterone (in men), estrogen (in women), or an estrogen/progesterone combination (in women) missing because of a pituitary problem.

If you’re taking hormone replacement medicine, your doctor may want to regularly monitor your hormone level. Doing so will make sure you’re getting the right amount of replacement hormones.

If you become very sick (such as with the flu) or go through a stressful time, your doctor may adjust the dose of replacement hormone you take (just as a normally functioning pituitary gland would do). You might also need a dose adjustment if you become pregnant or have a significant change in weight.

You should carry a medical alert card and bracelet at all times. This way, emergency medical workers know what kind of care you need in case of emergency.",Managing hypopituitarism using hormone replacement therapy is often successful. Just remember that you’ll need to check in regularly with your doctor to monitor hormone levels.,"• What is the likely cause of my hypopituitarism?

214,Hypothermia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hypothermia/,"Hypothermia is a medical condition. It occurs when you are exposed to bitter cold for a long time. Normal body temperature is 98.6°F. You have hypothermia if your body temperature drops below 95°F. Hypothermia also can occur in temperatures that are not bitterly cold, like those above 40°F. This is usually due to a person being wet, sweaty, or trapped in cold water. It is dangerous and can be life threatening. Most people don’t know they have it until it’s too late. If left untreated, hypothermia can cause a heart attack, liver damage, kidney failure, or death.

Hypothermia is different from frostbite. You can have frostbite by itself or with hypothermia. It depends on the type. Frostbite is an injury you get when a part of your body freezes. Common locations of frostbite are your nose, ears, fingers, and toes. With frostbite, your body parts can be numb, stiff, and/or white or grayish-yellow. The effects can be long-term for severe injuries. It may require amputation.

However, hypothermia is more serious and requires urgent medical care.","Symptoms are difficult to spot in babies and older people. Warning signs include:

• Shivering, fumbling hands, and/or decreased movement
• Unclear speech
• Sudden exhaustion or low energy
• Sudden confusion (unable to think clearly)
• Cold, red, and/or raw skin (skin may turn blue in later stage)
• Decreased breathing or heart rate","Hypothermia is caused by a drop in your body temperature. When your temperature drops, your body uses stored energy to stay warm. Hypothermia begins when the stored energy is used up. Your body can no longer produce heat. There are a few types of this condition with varying causes.

This occurs when your body temperature drops suddenly. This can happen if you fall into cold water. It also can happen if you are wet and in the cold. Hikers, hunters, and people who are without housing are at risk. People who are stranded outside in the cold for too long are at risk.

This occurs when your body temperature drops over a period of time. Elderly people and babies have a harder time controlling their body temperature. They are at risk of getting hypothermia over time. People of low incomes who don’t have access to heat or proper clothing are at risk.

This occurs when your body temperature drops because it is too tired to produce heat. People who are sick, have certain health conditions, or have substance use disorders are at risk.

This occurs when your body temperature drops after surgery in a hospital. It can be hard to maintain heat after receiving anesthesia.","If you suspect a person has hypothermia, take their temperature. A reading of less than 95°F means they could have hypothermia. You should get medical care immediately. A doctor will perform a physical exam. He or she will want to know the person’s lifestyle to determine what may have caused or contributed to the hypothermia. Additional tests include:

• Temperature test: The doctor or nurse will test the ear or rectum (bottom). This provides the most accurate reading.
• Electrocardiography (EKG): This test uses electric waves to look at your heartbeat. This will determine if it’s normal or not.
• Chest X-ray: This test uses radiation to look your chest and surrounding organs. Your doctor is looking for disease or injuries.
• Blood test: This test checks for substances in your blood.
• Computed tomography scan (CT scan): This test uses X-rays to check for internal injuries or other health problems.
• Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): This test uses radio waves to check for other injuries, such as tissue damage.","You can prevent or avoid most cases of hypothermia. To reduce your risk:

• Prepare for cold weather. Warm clothing and hats retain heat. Wear layers to prepare for changing conditions.
• Proper winter clothing includes: Mittens (not gloves) Raincoat and windbreaker Two pairs of socks (not cotton) Scarf and hat (that covers the ears)
• Mittens (not gloves)
• Raincoat and windbreaker
• Two pairs of socks (not cotton)
• Scarf and hat (that covers the ears)
• If you get wet, change your clothes immediately. Look for a warm, indoor area.
• Keep extra items in your car when traveling. This includes clothes, food, water, and blankets. If you get stranded in your car, call or signal for help right away. Stay in your car. Run the car heater for 10 minutes per hour to conserve gas. Make sure your car’s exhaust pipe is not blocked by snow. This can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.
• Do not eat snow or drink alcohol. This lowers your body temperatures.
• In cold temperatures, stay active to produce body heat and store energy.
• Keep your heat at home above 68°F. Close the vents and doors in rooms you don’t use. This retains heat and saves money.
• Care for babies. Check in on elderly people. Make sure they are warm, dry, clothed, and fed.

• Mittens (not gloves)
• Raincoat and windbreaker
• Two pairs of socks (not cotton)
• Scarf and hat (that covers the ears)","See a doctor immediately if you suspect you or someone else has hypothermia. Additionally:

• Move the person into a warm place as soon as possible.
• Give the person warm clothing. If their current clothes are wet, remove them.
• Cover the person with blankets or towels. Use an electric blanket or heating pad, if possible. Make sure they do not get too hot, though.
• Skin-to-skin contact with another person helps increase body temperature.
• Have the person drink warm liquids. Water, tea, or coffee are best. Do not drink alcohol. Do not give drinks to someone who is unconscious.

If the person is not breathing, begin CPR right away. Stay with the person until help arrives.

A hospital may provide other treatment. One example is infusing warm fluids into the body or providing oxygen. Another example is to flow the person’s blood through an external device to warm it up.",Hypothermia can be cured with little to no lasting effects. Severe cases may require ongoing treatment. Medical conditions that caused the hypothermia will need to be treated.,"• How long can you safely stay outdoors if you are dressed appropriately?
• How can I tell the difference between hypothermia and frostbite?
• Do you feel numb when you have hypothermia?
• How long can you have untreated hypothermia before you die?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Hypothermia

215,Hypothyroidism,https://familydoctor.org/condition/hypothyroidism/,"Hypothyroidism is known as underactive thyroid. It occurs when your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. It means you have low thyroid activity. The thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly. It is located in the front of your neck, below your Adam’s apple. The thyroid controls your metabolism. It makes hormones that control how well you burn calories, your heart rate, your muscles, bones, and other organs.

By asking the right questions, I diagnosed a treatable thyroid problem that my patient thought was part of aging. Read More","Hypothyroidism often begins slowly. Symptoms can be mistaken for stress, depression, or other health problems. Common symptoms include:

• Fatigue.
• Unplanned weight gain.
• Muscle weakness.
• Muscle aches, cramps, tenderness, or stiffness.
• Increased sensitivity to cold.
• Constipation.
• Pale, dry skin.
• Puffy face.
• Hoarse voice.
• Joint pain, stiffness, or swelling.
• Changes in menstrual patterns, such as heavier flow.
• An enlarged thyroid gland (called a goiter), which can appear as swelling at the base of the neck.
• Brittle hair and fingernails.
• Forgetfulness or confusion.

Anyone can have an underactive thyroid. This includes infants and teenagers. Babies who are born without a thyroid gland or with a thyroid that doesn’t work may not have many symptoms at first. They may have yellowing of the skin and yellowing of the whites of their eyes (jaundice). Their face could be puffy and their tongue may be enlarged causing choking. As the disease progresses, infants can have trouble feeding and may not grow and develop normally. They also may be constipated, sleepy, and have poor muscle tone. If it is not treated, hypothyroidism in infants can lead to physical and an intellectual disability. In the United States, newborn infants are screened for hypothyroidism before leaving the hospital.

Kids and teens who have hypothyroidism have the same symptoms as adults. In addition, they could have:

• Slow growth.
• Slow mental development.
• Delayed permanent teeth.
• Delayed puberty.","The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder called Hashimoto’s disease. Normally, the immune system helps protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other substances. An autoimmune disease causes it to attack your body’s tissues and/or organs. With Hashimoto’s, the immune system attacks the thyroid and keeps it from producing enough hormones.

Other common causes of hypothyroidism include:

• Certain medicines.
• Radiation therapy.
• Thyroid surgery.
• Treatment for hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).

Some less common causes of hypothyroidism include:

• Congenital disease. About 1 in 3,000 infants in the United States are born with a defective thyroid or no thyroid at all.
• Pituitary disorder. The pituitary gland produces a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This tells the thyroid gland how much thyroid hormone to produce. A pituitary disorder may keep the pituitary gland from producing the right amount of TSH to manage thyroid hormones.
• Some women have hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy. This is because their bodies produce antibodies that attack the thyroid gland. If not treated, hypothyroidism can be harmful to both mother and baby.
• Iodine deficiency. Iodine is a mineral used by the body to make thyroid hormones. A lack of iodine can keep your thyroid from producing enough hormones. In the United States, table salt has iodine added to it to make sure everyone gets enough.","Contact your doctor if you have symptoms of an underactive thyroid. He or she will do a blood test to measure the amount of thyroid hormone and TSH in your blood. This confirms the diagnosis.

Some doctors recommend screening older women for hypothyroidism during routine physical exams. Some also recommend screening women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. This is because low amounts of the thyroid hormone can play a role in infertility.","There is no known way to prevent hypothyroidism. It is more common in women than men, especially those older than 60 years of age. You also are at greater risk if you:

• Have a family history of thyroid disease.
• Have been treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medicines.
• Have received radiation therapy to your neck or upper chest.
• Have had thyroid surgery.","Treatment for hypothyroidism is a replacement thyroid hormone. You take the supplement daily in pill form. This medicine regulates your hormone levels and helps relieve symptoms. Over time, your metabolism goes back to normal. The medicine helps to lower your LDL cholesterol and may reverse some weight gain.

The correct medicine dose varies for each person. It may take a few tries to get the right dose. If you don’t take enough, you may continue to have symptoms of hypothyroidism. If you take too much, you may have symptoms similar to those of hyperthyroidism. Your doctor can tell how much to give based on your symptoms, blood test results, and the cause.

Some medicines and foods affect your body’s ability to absorb the replacement thyroid hormone. Examples of medicine are iron supplements, calcium supplements, cholestyramine, and aluminum hydroxide (found in some antacids). Tell your doctor if you eat large amounts of soy products or are on a high-fiber diet.","If it is not treated, hypothyroidism can lead to other health problems. These include:

• A goiter. It is common to have an enlarged thyroid. This can cause a swollen lump on your neck called a goiter. A goiter can affect your appearance and can even make it hard for you to swallow or eat.
• Obesity. Weight gain is common in people who have underactive thyroid. This is because your hormone levels affect your metabolism. Diet and exercise can help manage your weight.
• Heart disease. An underactive thyroid causes high levels of “bad” (LDL) cholesterol.
• Mental health issues. Depression that occurs with hypothyroidism can worsen over time.
• Myxedema. This is a rare, life-threatening condition. Symptoms are intense sensitivity to cold and drowsiness or severe lethargy. This can lead to unconsciousness and a coma. See a doctor right away if you notice these warning signs.
• Birth defects. Babies who are born to women who have untreated hypothyroidism can have birth defects.
• Infertility. Not enough thyroid hormone can make it hard for some women to get pregnant. An underactive thyroid also can be harmful to the mother and baby during pregnancy. Most doctors test women’s thyroid hormone levels at this stage.","• What is the cause of my hypothyroidism?

216,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP),https://familydoctor.org/condition/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-itp/,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder. “Idiopathic” means the cause of the condition is unknown. “Thrombocytopenic” means the blood doesn’t have enough platelets. (Platelets are also called thrombocytes.) “Purpura” means a person has excessive bruising.

When you have ITP, your immune system destroys the platelets in your blood. Platelets are the tiny cells that form blood clots. They seal minor cuts and wounds. A person who doesn’t have enough platelets bruises very easily. They can bleed for a long time after being injured. A person who has ITP might have nosebleeds that are hard to stop. Rarely, they might have bleeding in the intestines, or even bleeding in the brain with minor trauma.

ITP is also sometimes called “immune thrombocytopenic purpura” or “immune thrombocytopenia.” It can happen in adults or children. In children, the condition usually resolves on its own without treatment. For adults, it is often a long-term condition.","• Easy or excessive bruising.
• Tiny reddish purple dots on the body, especially on the lower legs. Called petechial rash, this is caused by bleeding under the surface of the skin.
• Cuts or minor wounds that take a very long time to clot or stop bleeding.
• Blood in the urine or stools.
• Unusually heavy menstrual flow in women.
• Unexplained bleeding from the nose or gums.

In most adults, ITP lasts much longer than it does in children. At the time of diagnosis, many adults have noticed symptoms for several weeks or months. At the same time, many adults have only mild thrombocytopenia. Some have no bleeding symptoms at all.","The cause of ITP is not known. People who have ITP form antibodies that destroy their blood platelets. Normally, antibodies are a healthy response. They attack and destroy bacteria or viruses. But in people who have ITP, the antibodies attack the body’s own cells. Doctor’s aren’t sure exactly why this happens.","Your doctor will ask you questions about your health. He or she will do a physical exam. They may take a blood sample for testing. The test counts blood cells and platelets. Or they may look at the sample under a microscope. Your doctor may also want you to get a bone marrow exam. This can help rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.

Many adults find out they have ITP by accident. Their blood is checked for another reason and a low blood platelet count is found.","Since there is no known cause, there is nothing that can prevent or avoid the condition.","Mild cases of ITP may not require treatment, just regular monitoring of platelet levels. More serious cases will require treatment.

Treatment of ITP in adults does not cure the disease. It is aimed at increasing the blood platelet count. Your doctor may recommend that you take prednisone for several weeks or months. Prednisone is a steroid that raises the level of your platelet count. As your count rises and reaches a safe level, your doctor may gradually decrease your medicine. However, when the medicine is stopped, your platelet count may decrease again.

Other treatments for ITP include other medicines. These include:

• Another kind of steroid called danazol.
• Medicines that suppress the immune system.
• Infusions of high-dose gamma globulin.
• Anti-RhD therapy for people with certain blood types.

If medicines don’t help enough, your doctor may recommend that your spleen be removed. The spleen makes most of the antibodies that destroy the blood platelets. It also destroys old or damaged blood cells. But removing the spleen permanently reduces your body’s ability to fight infection. Some people can have the ITP come back even after the spleen is removed. So this treatment is not done as often as it used to be.

ITP in children is usually mild. It runs its course without the need for treatment. About 80% of children recover completely from ITP within about 6 months. When a child is diagnosed, many doctors recommend just watching the child carefully. However, some doctors recommend a short treatment with prednisone pills or gamma globulin infusions. These treatments will increase the platelet count more quickly. Both medicines have some side effects.","If you have ITP, you should avoid medicines that increase risks for bleeding. Some of these include warfarin, aspirin, or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). You should also limit alcohol. It can decrease the ability of your blood to clot.","• I bruise easily.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","There are 2 types of ITP—acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term). Acute ITP mainly affects children. They often get the condition after a viral illness, such as the flu. The usual age for a child getting ITP is 2 to 4 years of age. Chronic ITP typically affects adults. Most adults with ITP are young women, but it can occur in anyone. ITP does not seem to be hereditary (run in families). ITP is not contagious (you can’t “catch it” from someone else).

Many of the medicines used to treat ITP should not be taken by women who are pregnant. Talk to your doctor if you are taking medicine for ITP and want to become pregnant.

Diagnosing ITP during pregnancy can be difficult. Platelet counts may be low for other reasons. About 5% of women have mildly low platelet counts at the end of a normal pregnancy. The cause of this is unknown. The platelet count goes back to normal right after delivery.

A baby born to a mother who has ITP may have a low blood platelet count a few days to a few weeks after birth. These babies usually are kept in the hospital for several days. That way, doctors can make sure they are okay before sending them home. If the baby’s platelet count is very low, treatment is available to speed recovery."
217,Indigestion | Symptoms and Relief,https://familydoctor.org/condition/indigestion-dyspepsia/,"Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, is a common condition. It can happen when your body has trouble digesting food. It occurs in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a group of organs that plays a part in digestion. Anyone can get indigestion. You can get it on occasion, or it can be an ongoing problem. The symptoms and causes vary by case. If there is no known cause for indigestion, it is referred to as functional dyspepsia.","Indigestion can feel like a stomachache. You can have a range of symptoms including:

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","A lot of factors can cause indigestion. These include:

• Eating certain foods, such as ones that are spicy and fatty or have lots of acid or fiber
• Eating too late in the day
• Drinking alcohol or too much caffeine
• Taking certain medicines
• Smoking
• Not sleeping

Certain health issues, like problems in your GI tract, also can cause indigestion. These include:

• Acid reflux, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): This is when your food and drink comes back up from your stomach after eating or drinking. It’s in the form of acid and can come into your esophagus, the tube-like organ connecting your mouth and stomach. Acid reflux can produce vomiting and/or heartburn.
• Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): This disorder affects your intestines. Symptoms include stomach pain, bloating, gas, constipation, and diarrhea.
• Infection: A bacterial infection from Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) can cause indigestion.
• Gastroparesis: This condition affects digestion. It is your stomach’s inability to pass food through the intestine. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, bloating, and acid reflux.
• Ulcer: This is a sore on the lining of your stomach (peptic ulcer), small intestine, or esophagus.
• Gastritis: This is inflammation of your stomach lining.
• Stomach cancer: This is a rare condition, but indigestion can be one of its signs.","Your doctor will review your symptoms and perform a physical exam to diagnose indigestion. They also may order tests to determine the cause. Those tests can include blood work, urine/stool tests, or an X-ray or ultrasound. Sometimes your doctor may perform an upper endoscopy to see inside your stomach. Your doctor will insert a thin tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus. This will be done after you’re given medicines to go to sleep.","Limit the use of alcohol. If you use tobacco, try to quit. Stress and lack of sleep also can worsen symptoms.","Your treatment will depend on the cause of your indigestion. Your doctor can help you decide which treatment is best for you.

Some over-the-counter medicines may help your symptoms. Check with your doctor before starting something new.

• Antacids (two brand names: Tums and Alka-Seltzer) work against the acid in your system.
• Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole (one brand name: Prilosec) and lansoprazole (one brand name: Prevacid), help block the site of acid production in your stomach.
• Histamine blockers (one brand name: Pepcid) may help reduce pain and symptoms. Talk to you doctor before using these long-term.

Do not take pain and anti-inflammatory medicines (some brand names: Advil, Aleve, Motrin) for your symptoms. They do not help and can worsen your condition, especially if used often.

If you have a stomach ulcer, you may need to take an acid-blocking medicine. But your ulcer can be cured. If you have an infection in your stomach, you also may need to take an antibiotic.

Don’t lie down too soon after eating."
218,Infant Jaundice,https://familydoctor.org/condition/infant-jaundice/,"Infant jaundice is common during the first few days of a baby’s life. It’s caused by high levels of bilirubin. This can make your baby’s skin, eyes, and mouth (under the tongue) turn a yellow color. While the color can look odd, infant jaundice usually isn’t serious.","The main symptom of jaundice is a yellowing of your baby’s skin. Look for color changes in the skin, the whites of your baby’s eyes, and the pink skin inside your baby’s mouth. If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when you gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow when you press it, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to see yellowing. But you should still be able to tell by the coloring of your baby’s eyes and under your baby’s tongue. If any of these three areas appear to be a yellowish color, call your baby’s doctor.

Infant jaundice usually appears between 2 and 7 days after birth. As the amount of bilirubin in the blood builds up, your baby’s body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby’s head down to the chest and even down to the toes. These are signs that your baby may have more severe jaundice. If this happens, you should call your baby’s doctor right away.

Artificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that isn’t really there. Try to check your baby in natural daylight in a sunny room.","Jaundice is caused when too much bilirubin builds up in your baby’s body. Bilirubin is a yellow substance made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. The liver filters it from the blood, and it leaves the body through the stool (poop). This is a normal process that happens all through life. However, babies sometimes get a buildup of bilirubin in their bodies. Your baby’s liver might not yet be developed enough to filter out the bilirubin. Or your baby may have a condition that increases the number of red blood cells that need to be replaced. These can cause the bilirubin to build up in your baby’s body, causing jaundice.

There are several common types of jaundice:

• Physiological (normal) jaundice:Many newborns have this jaundice. Most of the time it isn’t severe. It doesn’t cause any problems and goes away on its own within 2 weeks.
• Prematurity jaundice:Premature babies’ livers often aren’t developed enough to break down bilirubin effectively. They’re often treated, even if their bilirubin levels aren’t as high.
• Breastfeeding jaundice:Babies can get this when they don’t get enough breast milk. This can happen because of difficulties with breastfeeding or because the mother’s milk hasn’t come in yet.
• Breast milk jaundice:Sometimes substances in breast milk cause bilirubin levels to rise. They can also make it harder for the baby’s body to get rid of bilirubin through the stool. This type starts after 3 to 5 days and slowly gets better over a number of weeks.

In some cases, jaundice is caused by an underlying problem. This could include bleeding, infection, or a liver condition.

Your baby is more likely to have jaundice if he or she is:

• Premature (born before 38 weeks):A premature baby is more likely to have an immature liver. He or she may have fewer bowel movements than a full-term baby. This means that a premature baby might not be able to remove bilirubin as quickly as a full-term baby.
• Bruised during birth: Bruises create more red blood cells that need to be turned into bilirubin. This can raise bilirubin levels in the bloodstream.
• Having trouble breastfeeding: Babies who have trouble breastfeeding may be dehydrated or have a low calorie intake. This can increase the risk of jaundice. Ask your doctor for help if you or your baby are having trouble breastfeeding.","Your baby’s doctor will watch for signs of jaundice while you and your baby are still in the hospital. Your baby’s bilirubin levels can be checked 24 hours after birth. A probe may be used that estimates the bilirubin level just by touching the skin. If the level is high, it will be confirmed by a blood test.

If you’re at home and your baby’s skin becomes yellow, call your baby’s doctor right away. He or she will measure the amount of your baby’s bilirubin through a blood test. The doctor will probably measure your baby’s bilirubin level several times. If necessary, your baby will be treated for infant jaundice. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby.","In most cases, jaundice can’t be prevented. However, you can reduce the risk that your baby will develop jaundice by feeding him or her at least 8 to 12 times a day for the first several days. This will help your baby have regular bowel movements, which will remove bilirubin from his or her body.","Most of the time, treatment for jaundice isn’t needed. Mild jaundice usually goes away on its own in 1 to 2 weeks.

For more serious cases of jaundice, your baby might need treatment at the hospital. Most babies who need treatment for jaundice get light therapy (also called phototherapy).

During phototherapy, your baby is placed under special lights or on a special light-producing blanket. He or she will wear only a diaper and a mask to protect his or her eyes. The light helps your baby’s body get rid of the excess bilirubin. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days. Sometimes, if the bilirubin levels aren’t too high, you may be able to use phototherapy at home.

In rare cases, phototherapy doesn’t work. If your baby’s bilirubin level continues to rise, your baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby’s blood is taken out and replaced with fresh blood.

If an underlying condition is causing the jaundice, your doctor will treat the underlying condition.","How long jaundice lasts differs from baby to baby. Often, a baby’s bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is fed formula.

Jaundice isn’t a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous, and even cause brain damage. The risk of serious injury to your baby from high bilirubin levels is increased if your baby is premature. But jaundice is almost always diagnosed before the bilirubin level gets high enough to cause this kind of damage.","• Does my baby need treatment?

219,Infertility | Causes and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/infertility/,"Infertility means a couple isn’t able to become pregnant after 1 year of having regular, unprotected sex. Infertility can affect both women and men. A woman is considered infertile if she has tried for 1 year to get pregnant and hasn’t used birth control. A man is considered infertile if he has too few sperm or his sperm are too unhealthy to combine with a woman’s egg. Many couples don’t have trouble becoming pregnant. Unfortunately, there are factors that can make it difficult for some.","The main symptom of infertility is not being able to get pregnant. There may be no other symptoms. Sometimes women can have problems relating to their period such as pain or abnormal bleeding. Some men can have problems with erectile disfunction. However, most couples will have no other symptoms other than not getting pregnant.","Making a baby (getting pregnant) is complex. Both the man and the woman must have certain processes working properly. Because of this, many factors can cause infertility and make it difficult to get pregnant.

A woman’s fertility can be affected by:

• Problems with ovulation. This is the process by which the egg leaves the ovary and travels to meet the sperm. Some women don’t ovulate every month.
• Problems with your reproductive system, including your fallopian tubes, cervix, uterus, or ovaries. This might include a blockage, growths, scarring, enlarged ovaries, or an abnormal opening of the cervix.
• Early-onset menopause. This would occur before the age of 40. It may be tied to an immune system disease, cancer treatments, or a genetic syndrome.
• Diseases and disorders, including endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases (when your body attacks itself), lupus, and celiac disease.
• Delayed puberty or absence of a period.
• Smoking and substance abuse.
• Being overweight or underweight. Even too much or too little exercise can affect a woman’s chances of getting pregnant.
• After age 35, it gets harder for a woman to get pregnant.

A man’s fertility can be affected by:

• Unhealthy or poorly functioning sperm. This includes the quality of the man’s sperm as well as how quickly they move.
• Bacterial infection. This can be an infection inside the man’s testicles. It can also be a sexually transmitted infection.
• A varicocele. This is an enlargement of the veins inside the loose skin that surrounds a man’s testicles. It can cause low sperm count.
• Retrograde ejaculation. This means a man’s sperm goes into his bladder rather than outside the penis.
• Undescended testicles. One or both of a man’s testicles remain in his abdomen. Testicles are supposed to drop down from the abdomen into the scrotal sac at birth.
• Smoking and substance abuse.
• Sexual dysfunction. This can include erectile dysfunction or problems ejaculating too soon or not at all.
• Overheating the testicles. This can occur by wearing underwear or pants that are too tight. It can also happen by using a hot tub for extended periods.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","For both men and women, your doctor will conduct a medical exam. They will ask you questions about your general health and how long you’ve been trying to get pregnant. While your doctor will decide what additional testing is necessary, it will likely begin with blood tests. These will check hormone levels and genetics (for both men and women) and egg quality.

Women may have additional tests. These could include:

• Transvaginal ultrasound. A medical technician will insert a small wand, covered with latex, into your vagina. The wand is connected to a screen, where the technician can view images of the inside of your uterus and fallopian tubes. The technician will send the images to your doctor to review.
• This is an X-ray that involves injecting dye into your uterus to look for blockages inside your fallopian tubes. It doesn’t require anesthesia.
• Pelvic laparoscopy. This surgical procedure is performed in a hospital. A thin, flexible scope is inserted into your abdomen to give your doctor a better look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. It helps look for polyps, growths, and blockages.

For men, the first test will be to collect a sample of semen (the fluid that is ejaculated from the penis). This is used to examine his sperm count, quality, and movement.

Men may undergo further physical exams, which would look for:

• Past injury to his testicles or penis
• Discharge, a fluid that shouldn’t be in the man’s penis
• A swollen or enlarged prostate
• A varicocele
• Recent high fevers
• A history of mumps

A biopsy of the man’s testicles may be necessary to get a better sperm sample.","Some causes of infertility can’t be prevented or avoided. But both men and women can take steps to increase their chances of pregnancy.

• Quit smoking.
• Avoid alcohol and street drugs.
• Exercise moderately, but not so much that it interferes with your periods.
• Maintain a healthy weight.

• Avoid tobacco, drugs, and excessive alcohol use.
• Avoid high temperatures, such as hot tubs or saunas.
• Avoid industrial or environmental toxins.
• Exercise regularly.","Doctors base infertility treatment on the underlying cause. For women, treatment may involve medicine or surgery. The most common medicines stimulate the ovaries, helping them produce more eggs and increasing the chances of getting pregnant. Doctors may perform surgery to clear blockages or address issues with the fallopian tubes. They also use surgery to remove endometriosis, fibroids, polyps, or scarring—conditions that can affect fertility.

Men may also receive treatment through medicine or surgery. If a man experiences erectile dysfunction or problems with ejaculation, doctors may prescribe medication. If he has varicoceles in the testicles or blockages in the tubes that carry sperm, surgeons can correct these issues.

ART uses technologies to help a couple get pregnant. It may help people who have gone through various infertility treatments but still can’t get pregnant. Some options include:

• Intrauterine insemination (IUI). This procedure inserts healthy sperm into the woman’s uterus around the time of ovulation. It uses a long, narrow tube to insert the sperm. It can be done in the doctor’s office.
• In vitro fertilization (IVF). This is more expensive and complex than IUI. It requires stimulating the ovaries with hormones and removing eggs from the woman. The eggs are fertilized with sperm in a laboratory. Once an embryo develops, it is placed into the woman’s uterus. While they can be successful, there is no guarantee that IUI or IVF will result in a pregnancy.
• Third party-assisted ART. This is when another person helps a couple get pregnant. They can help by donating sperm, donating eggs, or donating embryos. They may also serve as a surrogate or gestational carrier. This means another person actually carries the baby for you.","Living with infertility is emotionally difficult. The disappointment of not becoming pregnant after trying each month can be hard on relationships. It can also be hard on your emotional health. It’s difficult to see friends, family, and even strangers have babies when you cannot. For those women who try IVF treatment, the hormones and egg-stimulating medicines can affect your emotional health. Long-term studies suggest they can impact your physical health as well (with possible links to breast cancer and ovarian cancer).

If you’re experiencing infertility, talk with your doctor about how to cope with disappointment each month. Sometimes a support group can help. Some couples turn to adoption after trying unsuccessfully to have a baby through pregnancy.","• If I’m over the age of 35, do I have to wait a year before being tested for infertility?
• What could be the reason for my infertility if my tests and my male partner’s test are fine?
• At what age does your fertility decline?
• What’s the best time in your monthly cycle to get pregnant?
• If I am currently using birth control, how long should I wait in between stopping the birth control and trying to get pregnant?
• Do birth control devices cause infertility?",null,null
220,Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd/,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the name of a group of disorders that cause the intestines to become inflamed (red and swollen). The inflammation lasts a long time before subsiding, but it usually comes back over and over again. Approximately 1.6 million Americans have some kind of inflammatory bowel disease.

The two primary types of inflammatory bowel disease are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.

Crohn’s disease is an IBD that causes ulcers to form in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Crohn’s disease can have “skip” areas that are normal. These normal areas lie in between areas that are affected. Some people who have Crohn’s disease have severe","symptoms. Others have symptoms that are not as severe. Some people who have the disease have long periods without symptoms, even without getting treatment. Others who have more severe symptoms will need long-term treatment or even surgery.

Ulcerative colitis is an IBD that causes your colon (large intestine) to become red and swollen. The redness and swelling can last for a few weeks or for several months. Ulcerative colitis always involves the last part of the colon (the rectum). It can go higher up in the colon, up to involving the whole colon. Ulcerative colitis never has the “skip” areas typical of Crohn’s disease. Symptoms may come and go. These occurrences are called flare-ups. Flare-ups can last many months and may come back at different times throughout your life.

The symptoms of Crohn’s disease vary, depending on which part or parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is/are affected. Common symptoms include:

• Diarrhea
• Stomach cramps
• Abdominal pain that comes and goes
• Blood in your stool
• Low appetite
• Unintended weight loss

Other less common symptoms may include fever, joint pain, eye problems, skin problems, and feeling tired (called fatigue). The symptoms of Crohn’s disease may be mild or severe. Symptoms may also come and go. They can start suddenly or gradually.

Symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary. Symptoms depend on how severe your case is and how much of your large intestine is affected. Common symptoms include:

• Rectal pain or bleeding
• Frequent, small bowel movements
• Feeling an urgent need to have a bowel movement
• Diarrhea
• Blood in the stool
• Abdominal cramping and pain
• A strong feeling that you need to have a bowel movement, but not being able to do so (called tenesmus)
• Pain on the left side of the abdomen
• Unintended weight loss
• Fatigue

In most people who have ulcerative colitis, these symptoms tend to come and go. You may have periods where you have no symptoms, followed by periods where you do have symptoms.","It is not yet known exactly what causes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. These diseases seem to run in families, which means that genetics play a role. Many researchers believe that inflammatory bowel diseases are caused by a problem with the immune system. Normally, the immune system protects your body from infection. In people who have an inflammatory bowel disease, the immune system mistakes food, healthy bacteria, and other substances for an infection. This causes the immune system to attack the cells of the intestine, which leads to inflammation.","Your doctor will give you a physical exam and listen to you describe your symptoms. To help diagnose the problem your doctor may order a number of tests, including blood tests and stool samples. Your doctor may also order one or more procedures to help them view your colon. Lower GI endoscopy procedures include colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy. During these procedures, your doctor uses a narrow, flexible tube to look directly inside your large intestine. Upper GI endoscopy allows a look at your stomach and small intestine for ulcers. For this type of endoscopy, you may swallow a small camera (called capsule endoscopy). If not, your doctor inserts a scope into your GI tract through your mouth.

Your doctor may also order other imaging tests such as X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI.","IBD cannot be prevented, but there are lifestyle changes you can make to minimize symptoms. The best thing you can do is to take good care of yourself. It’s important to eat a healthy diet. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may ask you to reduce the amount of fiber or dairy products in your diet. It also may be necessary to limit or avoid caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages. In addition to eating well, you need to get enough rest and exercise regularly. It’s also important that you learn to manage the stress in your life. When you become overly upset by things that happen at home or at work, your intestinal problems can get worse.","The goal of treatment is to get rid of the inflammation that causes your symptoms. Many types of medicine can help reduce inflammation. Talk to your doctor about anti-inflammatory drugs and drugs that suppress the immune system. Some medicines are needed only during flare-ups. You may need long-term medicines to suppress your immune system. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also recommend these medicines and supplements:

• Antibiotic
• Anti-diarrheal
• Laxative
• Pain reliever
• Vitamin supplements

In severe cases of inflammatory bowel disease, you may need to go to the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids or surgery.

During your treatment, you will most likely be treated by a team of doctors. This team may include your family physician, a gastroenterologist (a specialist in stomach and intestinal disorders), and, possibly, a surgeon.","If you have inflammatory bowel disease, you are at an increased risk of colon cancer. Talk to your doctor about when to start screening for colon cancer and how often to have screening.

Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis keep coming back and their symptoms can be unpredictable. This can cause patients who have these illnesses to become depressed. If you feel depressed, talk with your family doctor. An antidepressant medicine could help you feel better.","• How will my inflammatory bowel disease be treated?
• Will I need surgery? Are there other options?
• What lifestyle changes can I make to help inflammatory bowel disease?
• What are some medicines used to treat inflammatory bowel disease and what are the possible side effects?
• Are my children at risk of inflammatory bowel disease?","Ask questions. Read about IBD. Discuss treatments with your doctor. You’ll be able to understand your illness and manage it better. Patient support groups are helpful, especially if you have severe symptoms.

221,Ingrown Toenails,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ingrown-toenails/,"An ingrown toenail occurs when the side or corner of the nail curls down and digs into the skin of your toe. It is most common for the big toenail to become ingrown, but it can happen to any toenail.","Symptoms of an ingrown toenail include redness, swelling, and pain on your toe around the nail.","Many things can cause ingrown toenails. One main cause is wearing shoes that do not fit well. Shoes that are too tight or too small can press on your toenail in unnatural ways. Improperly trimmed toenails are another main cause. Toenails that are peeled off at the edge or trimmed down at the corners are more likely to become ingrown.

An injury to your toe also can cause an ingrown toenail. People who have deformed or misshaped toenails have a higher risk of ingrown toenails.","Your doctor can examine your toe and toenail. If your doctor determines that you have an ingrown toenail, they may order treatment. Be sure to tell your doctor if you get ingrown toenails often. People who have diabetes are at risk of complications from an ingrown toenail.","To avoid ingrown toenails, you should cut your nails straight across. The top of your nail should make a straight line. Do not pick at your nails or tear them at the corners. Wear shoes that fit correctly. Avoid high heels and tight-fitting shoes.","Mild ingrown toenails can be treated at home. Soak your foot in warm water for 15 to 20 minutes. Dry your foot, then place part of a cotton ball under the corner of your nail. You can wet the cotton with water or a disinfectant. This should be changed at least once a day. Try to wear shoes, such as sandals, that do not rub the toenail. This can delay healing or cause irritation.

Contact your doctor if your ingrown toenail does not improve or gets worse. Watch for signs, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, and drainage. You may have an infection. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic either in pill or cream form.

Severe cases of an ingrown toenail may require surgery. This is a minor procedure that involves removing the part of the nail that is ingrown. Before surgery, the doctor will numb your toe by injecting it with medicine. First, they cut your toenail along the edge that is growing into your skin. Then, they pull out the piece of nail. The doctor may apply a small electrical charge or liquid solution to the exposed part of your nail bed. This is called ablation. It should keep the toenail from growing into your skin again. Not all people need ablation.

Follow these instructions after surgery to care for your toe. Call your doctor if the toenail is not healing.

• Soak your foot in warm water each day.
• Apply antibiotic cream to the site at least twice a day.
• Keep a bandage over the site until it heals.
• Take acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (brand name: Motrin) as needed for pain.
• Keep the wound clean and dry. It is okay to shower the day after surgery.
• Wear loose fitting shoes for the first 2 weeks.
• Avoid running or strenuous activity for the first 2 weeks.","It is important to get treatment if you have an infection. If you don’t, the infection can spread to the rest of your toe or into your bone.

Treatment—at home or from your doctor—helps treat symptoms and heal the nail. Once the nail is healed, practice guidelines to prevent future problems. If you do not practice good foot care, the problem is more likely to reoccur. If you have surgery, it can take 2 to 4 months for your nail to grow back.","• What is the cause of my ingrown toenail?
• What type of treatment will heal my toenail? Will I need surgery?
• Do I need an antibiotic?
• What kind of shoes should I wear?
• Can you show me how to trim my nails?

222,Inhalant Use,https://familydoctor.org/condition/inhalant-abuse/,"Inhalant use is a form of substance use disorder. It is also called “huffing.” It involves breathing in or sniffing common household or workplace products on purpose to “get high.” Almost any aerosol or liquid solvent can be used as an inhalant. Some of the slang terms used for this form of substance use disorder include bold, laughing gas, poppers, rush, snappers, and whippets. Examples of common household products include:

• Oven cleaner
• Model glue
• Spray paint
• Correction fluid (for example, Liquid Paper)
• Paint thinner
• Cleaning fluids
• Nail polish remover
• Rubber cement
• Gasoline
• Whipped cream gas
• Vegetable sprays
• Deodorant sprays
• Lighter gas
• Laughing gas
• Nitrate medicine (prescription medicine for chest pain)

Teenagers are the most common users of inhalants. Inhalants are easy to get because they are legal and cheap. Teenagers often try inhalants before they try alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs.

There are several ways that a person can use inhalants.

• Snorting is when you breathe in the fumes of a product directly from its container.
• Huffing is when you soak a rag in the product, put the rag over your nose, and inhale.
• Bagging is when you pour the product into a bag, hold it over your mouth and nose, and inhale.","It can be hard to recognize the signs of inhalant use. Teenagers who use inhalants may show some of the following signs.

• Bloodshot or dilated eyes
• Chapped lips or face
• Runny nose or frequent nosebleeds
• Chemical-like odor on their breath
• Paint stains on their hands and clothes
• Appearing drunk or high
• Slurred speech

Your child may complain of symptoms, such as:

• Headaches
• Dizziness
• Nausea and vomiting
• Poor memory

223,Insect-borne Diseases,https://familydoctor.org/condition/insect-borne-diseases/,"Insect-borne diseases are viral and bacterial illnesses from insect (bug) bites. The most common insects that pass on disease are mosquitoes, sand flies, ticks, and fleas. For example, mosquitoes are known for spreading the Zika virus, Yellow Fever, and Malaria. Ticks are known to spread Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.","Symptoms will vary depending upon the type of insect that bit you. Common symptoms of insect-borne diseases can include:

• Fever
• Chills
• Headache
• Sore muscles
• Skin rash
• Nausea
• Stomach pain

More serious symptoms can include:

• Difficulty breathing
• The feeling that your throat is closing
• Swelling of your lips, tongue, or face
• Chest pain
• A racing heartbeat that lasts more than a few minutes
• Dizziness
• Vomiting","The diseases are caused by blood-sucking insects that infect humans when they bite. You increase your risk of being infected by an insect when you are in areas where they gather. This would include tall grass, bushes, spots near still water (ponds), sand, forests, and places around the globe with heavy outbreaks.","Your doctor can typically diagnose an insect-borne disease with a physical exam, a review of your symptoms, and a look at your recent travel. Lab tests (blood and urine) can help diagnose certain insect-borne diseases.","There are many actions you can take to reduce the threat of being infected by an insect. You should:

• Stay out of tall grass and bushes.
• Wear long pants, long sleeves, and a hat if you must be in tall grass and bushes. Tuck your pants into long, white socks.
• Wear light-colored clothing. This makes it easier to spot insects.
• Wear insect-repellant clothing.
• Use bug spray that contains the ingredient DEET. Read the product’s label to see how much you should use.
• Examine your skin and scalp when you get back to check for bugs or bites. Always shower with plenty of soap after being in the outdoors.
• To discourage mosquitoes from living around your home, drain or change standing water on your property. For example, make sure your rain gutters are clear. Also change the water in a bird bath every four or five days.
• Pay attention to outbreaks through the travel health notices posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If you can, avoid travel to those places during outbreaks.","As soon as you recognize a bite, clean it with soap and water. Pat it dry and apply rubbing alcohol.

If you were bitten by a tick, remove the tick right away before cleaning the area. Use tweezers to slowly pull it off your skin. Be careful not to leave any part of the tick on your skin. Dispose of the tick. Wash your hands and the bite area with soap and water and wipe with alcohol. Apply an over-the-counter antibiotic cream to the bite area.

If you have any of the symptoms listed, see your doctor. Your doctor may give you a prescription for antibiotic medicine. Take the entire prescription. Your doctor may suggest other treatments to ease the symptoms. For example, over-the-counter pain medicine can relieve sore muscles and a fever.","Some insect-borne diseases cause long-term symptoms that affect your quality of life. Lyme disease, for example, can leave you with sore muscles and fatigue. Zika virus can be passed on to a baby and cause microcephaly (a condition that causes the head to be abnormally small) and intellectual disability.","• How long does it take before a skin rash appears?

224,Insomnia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/insomnia/,"Insomnia is a sleep disorder that happens when you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. Acute insomnia is short-term trouble sleeping. It may last a few weeks then go away. Chronic insomnia is when your sleeping problem happens several nights a week and lasts for more than a few months. Many people have insomnia. However, it’s more common in older adults, and more women than men have it.

Getting enough sleep is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Insomnia can affect you mentally and physically. It can make you feel tired, depressed, and irritable. It can also make it hard for you to concentrate or perform tasks during the day. If you have insomnia, you may worry about being able to sleep. Sometimes this can make sleeping harder.

If you don’t get enough sleep on a regular basis, you’re at increased risk of diseases. These include high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.

Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. You know you’re getting enough sleep if you don’t feel sleepy during the day. The amount of sleep you need stays about the same throughout adulthood. However, sleep patterns may change as you age, and become less deep and restful. That is why older people may sleep less at night and take naps during the day.","• Lying awake for a long time before falling asleep on most nights
• Not being able to stay asleep
• Waking up very early
• Feeling like you haven’t slept at all
• Falling asleep during the day, including while driving","Primary insomnia is a distinct disorder. It usually lasts at least a month. It isn’t well understood. Things that can cause this kind of insomnia include:

• Life changes
• Major or long-lasting stress or emotional upset
• Travel or work schedules that disrupt your sleep routine
• Habits that you’ve formed to deal with your lack of sleep (naps, worrying about sleep, going to bed early)

Some cases of insomnia are a symptom or side effect of another problem. This is called secondary insomnia. Many different disorders can cause insomnia. They include:

• Emotional conditions: Depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder
• Neurological disorders: Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease
• Pain conditions: Arthritis and headache disorders
• Gastrointestinal disorders: Heartburn, GERD
• Sleep disorders: Restless legs syndrome or sleep apnea
• Breathing disorders: Asthma or heart failure
• Other conditions: Such as overactive thyroid, stroke, or menopause

Secondary insomnia also can be caused by some medicines. These include asthma medicines, allergy or cold medicines, and certain heart and blood pressure medicines. Additionally, the use of some substances can cause insomnia. These include caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol.

Insomnia can sometimes run in families.","Insomnia is diagnosed primarily based on your medical and sleep history. Your doctor may ask you:

• Questions about your sleep habits, including when you go to bed and when you get up
• What medicines you take
• Your intake of caffeine and alcohol
• If you smoke
• About events or problems in your life that may be upsetting you
• How long you’ve been having insomnia
• If you have any pain, such as from arthriti

If you have a bed partner, your doctor may ask them if you snore while you sleep

If the cause of your insomnia isn’t clear, your doctor may order a blood test. They also may ask you to wear a small monitor while you sleep. The information may help your doctor determine the cause of your insomnia

Your doctor may suggest you keep a sleep diary. For a sleep diary, you record:

• What time you went to bed
• How long you were in bed before falling asleep
• How often you woke up during the night
• What time you got up in the morning
• How well you slept
• The time and length of any naps.
• How you felt during the day (sleepy or alert)
• What you drank (caffeine or alcohol and at what time)
• When you exercise

Take your sleep diary to your next doctor’s appointment. A sleep diary may help you and your doctor identify patterns and conditions that are affecting your sleep. Your doctor may also do a physical exam. This will help them rule out other medical problems that could be causing your insomnia.

If your doctor thinks another sleep disorder is causing your insomnia, they may order a sleep study. This is when you sleep in a lab overnight. Lab technicians monitor your brain activity, eye movements, oxygen levels, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. Or your doctor may order a type of sleep study that is done at home.","The best way to prevent insomnia is to develop a good sleep routine. In some cases, it can’t be prevented or avoided.

• Avoid substances that make sleeping harder. These include caffeine, some medicines, and alcohol.
• Adopt better sleep habits. Follow a bedtime routine, keep your room dark and cool, and avoid watching TV or using your phone in the bedroom. Go to bed around the same time and wake up around the same time every day.
• Don’t eat, drink, or exercise close to bedtime.","There are several ways to treat insomnia. Treatment usually depends on your health and sleep history. It also may depend on what kind of insomnia you have.

Behavioral therapy for insomnia can teach you about good sleep habits. It usually includes learning ways to relax and not worry as much about sleep. You can also learn muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises to help you relax. These are often just as effective as prescription sleeping medicines.","Keep in mind that you may need less sleep as you age. Some people need only 5 to 6 hours of sleep a night, but most people do better with between 7 and 9 hours. Sleep usually occurs in 3-hour cycles, so it’s important to get at least 3 uninterrupted hours of sleep.

These tips can help you develop better sleep habits:

• Go to sleep only when you feel tired.
• Avoid reading, watching TV, or worrying in bed. These can cause your body and brain to associate your bed with these activities, rather than with sleep.
• Develop a bedtime routine. Do the same thing every night before going to sleep. For example, take a warm bath and then read for 10 minutes every night before bed. Soon you’ll connect these activities with sleeping and doing them will help make you sleepy.
• Use the bedroom only for sleep and sexual activity.
• If you can’t fall asleep after 15 minutes, go to another room. Return to your bed only when you feel tired. You may repeat this as often as needed during the night.
• Go to sleep and wake up at the same times each day, even on weekends. This helps your body develop a sleep schedule.
• Avoid or limit napping. It can disturb your normal sleep rhythm. If you must take a nap, only rest for 30 minutes. Don’t nap after 3:00 p.m.
• Avoid caffeine and tobacco, especially late in the day.
• Avoid eating large meals or drinking a lot of water in the evening.
• Keep your bedroom at a comfortable temperature.
• Make sure your bedroom is quiet and dark. If noise is a problem, use a fan to mask the noise or use earplugs. If you must sleep during the day, hang dark blinds over the windows or wear an eye mask.
• Try eating a light snack before going to bed, but don’t eat too much right before bedtime. A glass of warm milk or some cheese and crackers may be all you need.
• Exercise regularly, but don’t exercise within a few hours before going to bed.
• Set aside some time to relax before going to bed. For example, spend 30 minutes after dinner writing down what’s worrying you and what you can do about it

Another good way to relax is to focus on your breathing by taking slow, deep breaths while counting to 5. Then listen to the sound of your breath as you breathe out. You can also try to tighten and relax the muscle groups in your body. Begin at your feet and work your way up to your face and head. A trained therapist can teach you other ways to relax. Listening to relaxation music may also help.","• How can I make myself go back to sleep if I wake up during the night?

But it’s a good idea to check with your doctor before you try one. OTC sleep aids are not meant to be used for a long time. Be sure to follow the directions on the label carefully. Don’t drink alcohol while you are taking an OTC sleep aid.

Certain supplements are advertised as treatments for insomnia. Some examples are melatonin and valerian. There isn’t much evidence about how well these products work. Researchers don’t know what the long-term effects of using them are. Talk to your doctor before you try one of these products.

In some cases, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help you fall asleep and stay asleep. Prescription sleeping pills may help you sleep better. Common ones include eszopiclone (brand name: Lunesta), zolpidem (brand name: Ambien), and zaleplon (brand name: Sonata)

These medicines can have side effects. Some may be serious. Side effects of prescription sleeping pills can include:

• Excessive drowsiness
• Trouble thinking clearly
• Problems with balance

Rare but serious side effects include:

• Facial swelling
• Severe allergic reactions
• Unusual behavior while asleep (such as driving or eating food)

Doctors generally don’t recommend using prescription sleep medicines for long periods of time. They’re not a cure for insomnia. Although they can help in some cases, they’re only a temporary form of relief. Regular use may lead to rebound insomnia. This happens when you quit taking sleeping pills and your insomnia comes back even worse than before.

Sleeping pills can be unsafe to use if you have certain health problems. Ask your doctor if sleeping pills are right for you."
225,Insulin Resistance | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/insulin-resistance/,"Insulin resistance is a condition linked to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. It means your body is unable to respond to the amount of the hormone insulin it is producing. Insulin is made by your pancreas, one of your body’s organs. It helps protect your body from getting too much sugar (glucose). Glucose gives you energy. However, too much sugar is harmful to your health.","Most people don’t realize they have insulin resistance until they have a blood test. Everyone has high blood sugar levels from time to time. However, when your body’s sugar level is consistently high, you may notice you are thirstier than usual, urinate more, are more tired, have blurred vision, and have some tingling on the bottom of your feet.

Living with insulin resistance requires lifestyle changes as well as regular use of prescription medicine. You will have to be more careful in making meal and snack choices, reading labels, and maintaining a lower weight. You also will have to commit to regular exercise and take your medicines as prescribed.","Obesity (being significantly overweight and belly fat), an inactive lifestyle, and a diet high in carbohydrates are the primary causes of insulin resistance. Some women develop insulin resistance while they are pregnant. This is called gestational diabetes. Certain diseases are associated with insulin resistance. That includes heart disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome.

Certain risk factors are associated with insulin resistance, including:

• A family history of diabetes
• A sedentary (not active) lifestyle
• Race (especially if you are Black, Hispanic, or Native American)
• Age (the older you get, the more your risk increases)
• Hormones
• Steroid use
• Some medicines
• Poor sleep habits
• Smoking","Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms, your personal and family medical history, evaluate your weight, and take your blood pressure. Diagnosing insulin resistance requires a blood test. This might be done through a small finger prick or by having a small needle inserted into a vein to take a sample of blood. You will often be required to fast (avoid eating or drinking anything except water) 8 hours before the test. The blood sample will be sent to a lab for testing. It will test your fasting blood sugar. Anything more than 100 mg/dL is an indication of insulin resistance. Your doctor also may have the lab check your cholesterol levels (from the same blood sample). People with insulin resistance often have high cholesterol.

Your doctor will also test your hemoglobin A1C level as part of the diagnostic workup. This is a similar blood test that offers the doctor a look at how your sugar levels have been during the past 3 months.

The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends blood glucose screening of all pregnant women for gestational diabetes after the 24th week of pregnancy. Also, the AAFP recommends blood glucose screening for adults age 40 to 70 years who are overweight or have obesity and may be at risk of heart disease.","You cannot prevent or avoid risk factors such as race, age, and a family medical history. You can take steps to reduce your insulin resistance by losing weight (even 10% can make a difference), exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Choose healthy carbohydrates. For example, eat whole grain bread instead of white bread, drink water instead of soda, and reduce your intake of sugary foods.

If you have or have had gestational diabetes, insulin resistance typically goes away after you give birth. However, you are at greater risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when you are older. That should be a warning to change your diet and lifestyle early so that you can delay it for as long as possible.","Diet, weight loss, and exercise can improve insulin resistance. However, most people need medicine as well. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine that works best for your health and lifestyle needs. If your insulin resistance leads to uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, you may need insulin (given through a pump or daily injection).",null,"• Does insulin resistance always lead to diabetes?

226,Interstitial Cystitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/interstitial-cystitis/,"Interstitial cystitis is chronic inflammation of the bladder. People who have the condition have a bladder wall that is irritated and inflamed (sore and red). This inflammation can scar the bladder or make it stiff. A stiff bladder can’t expand as urine fills it. In some cases, the walls of the bladder may bleed slightly. Some people get sores in the bladder lining. More than 3 million American women and 1 million men have interstitial cystitis.

People who have interstitial cystitis may have the following","symptoms:

• An urgent need to urinate, both in the daytime and during the night. They may pass only very small amounts of urine each time.
• Pressure, pain, and tenderness around the bladder, pelvis, and perineum. (The perineum is the area between the anus and vagina or the anus and the scrotum). This pain and pressure may increase as the bladder fills and decrease as it empties with urination.
• A bladder that won’t hold as much urine as it used to hold
• Pain during sexual intercourse
• In men, discomfort or pain in the penis or scrotum

For many women, the symptoms get worse before their menstrual period. Stress may also make the symptoms worse, but it doesn’t cause them.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes interstitial cystitis. However, they do know that it isn’t caused by bacterial or viral infections that can be tracked through standard tests.

A defect in the lining of the bladder might cause the condition. Normally, the lining protects the bladder wall from the toxic effects of urine. In about 70% of the people who have interstitial cystitis, the protective layer of the bladder is “leaky.” This may let urine irritate the bladder wall, causing interstitial cystitis. If the urine contains an abnormal substance, it can be even more irritating.

Other possible causes may be an increase of histamine-producing cells in the bladder wall (allergy). Or it could be caused by an autoimmune response. This is when your body mistakenly fights something healthy elsewhere in your body.","It’s difficult to diagnose cystitis, so your doctor may have to rule out other conditions first. Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history. They may ask you to keep track of:

• How much fluid you drink
• How often you urinate
• How much urine you pass

Your doctor will rule out other diseases such as:

• Urinary tract infections
• Bladder cancer
• Endometriosis
• Kidney stones
• Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
• Chronic prostatitis in men
• Vaginal infections in women

Your doctor may also refer you to a urologist. This is a doctor whose specializes in problems of the urinary tract. The urologist may use a special scope (called a cytoscope) to look inside your bladder. They will look for inflammation, for ulcers, or to pinpoint bleeding. These things could indicate that you have interstitial cystitis.",You cannot prevent this condition because doctors aren’t sure what causes it.,"There is no cure for interstitial cystitis. You may need to try several treatments or a combination of treatments before you notice an improvement in your symptoms. Most people feel better after trying one or more of the following treatments:

• Diet. Your doctor may tell you to change what you eat. You may need to avoid alcohol, acidic foods, and tobacco.
• Bladder distention. Under anesthesia, a doctor overfills your bladder with gas or fluid. This stretches the walls of the bladder. Doctors are not sure exactly why this helps. It may make your bladder better able to hold more urine. It may also interfere with the pain signals sent by nerves in the bladder.
• Medicine. Your doctor may have you take an oral medicine called pentosan polysulfate. This medicine protects the lining of the bladder wall from the toxic parts of urine. Another oral medicine used to treat interstitial cystitis is an antihistamine called hydroxyzine. This medicine reduces the amount of histamine that is made in the bladder wall. Another medicine that may help is amitriptyline. It blocks pain and reduces bladder spasms. This medicine can make you sleepy, so it is usually taken at bedtime. Your doctor may also suggest that you take an over-the-counter pain medicine to ease pain.
• Bladder instillation. During a bladder instillation, a catheter (a thin tube) is used to fill your bladder with liquid medicine. You hold the medicine inside your bladder for a few seconds to 15 minutes. Then the liquid is released through urination. Treatments are given every 1 to 2 weeks for 6 to 8 weeks. The treatment can be repeated as needed.","The treatments listed above should provide some relief from interstitial cystitis. But there are also things you can do on your own to help relieve symptoms.

• Diet. Alcohol, tomatoes, spices, carbonated drinks, chocolate, caffeine, citrus fruits and drinks, pickled foods, artificial sweeteners, and acidic foods may irritate your bladder. That makes symptoms worse. Try removing these things from your diet for a couple of weeks. Then try eating one food at a time to see if it makes your symptoms worse.
• Smoking. Many people who have interstitial cystitis find that smoking makes their symptoms worse. Because smoking is also a main cause of bladder cancer, people who have interstitial cystitis have another good reason to quit smoking.
• Bladder training. Many people can train their bladder to urinate less often. You can train your bladder by going to the bathroom at scheduled times and using relaxation techniques.
• Physical therapy. People who have interstitial cystitis may have painful spasms of pelvic floor muscles. If you have muscle spasms, you can learn exercises to help strengthen and relax your pelvic floor muscles.
• TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). You can use a TENS machine to put mild electrical pulses into your body through special wires. Some doctors think that electrical pulses increase blood flow to the bladder. The increased blood flow strengthens the muscles that help control the bladder. It also releases hormones that block pain.
• Support group. You might consider joining a support group. The support of family, friends and other people who have interstitial cystitis can help you cope. People who learn about interstitial cystitis and participate in their own care do better than people who do not. A support group can provide you and your family with helpful tips and additional information.","• How do my symptoms indicate interstitial cystitis, instead of another condition, such as an infection or urinary incontinence?
• Do I need any tests to confirm a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis?
• Will I need to see a specialist?
• What are my treatment options? Which treatment is best for me?

227,Interstitial Nephritis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/interstitial-nephritis/,"Interstitial nephritis is a kidney disorder. The kidneys filter waste and extra fluid from the body. When you have interstitial nephritis, the spaces between tubules (small tubes) inside the kidney become inflamed. This reduces the kidneys’ ability to filter properly.

Interstitial nephritis is a serious condition, but it can be treated. In rare cases, it may cause kidney failure. When the kidneys fail, waste and extra fluid will build up in the body. This can affect the heart, brain, lungs, and other organs.","The most common symptom of interstitial nephritis is a decrease in the amount of urine you produce. Other symptoms can include:

• Increased urine output
• Blood in your urine or dark urine
• Nausea or vomiting
• Fever or rash
• Elevated blood pressure
• Changes in mental status, such as drowsiness or confusion
• Swelling of any area of your body
• Sudden weight gain. This can be caused by extra fluid in the body.","Interstitial nephritis can be caused by the following problems:

• Infections
• A reaction to a medicine, such as certain antibiotics
• Too much of certain medicines. These include diuretics (water pills) or pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
• Unbalanced levels of certain nutrients in your blood. This includes too little potassium or too much calcium.
• Autoimmune disorders, such as Kawasaki disease or Sjogren syndrome

Interstitial nephritis may occur 2 or more weeks after you start a medicine. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about a medicine you’re taking.","Your doctor will ask you about your medical history, including what medicines you take. They may need to listen to your heart and lungs for signs of excess fluid. This can be one sign of kidney failure. They will check you for high blood pressure, which also is a sign of kidney problems.

If you have one or more symptoms, your doctor may test your urine (called a urinalysis) and your blood. They may also order imaging tests of your kidneys, such as an ultrasound. If tests detect something, your doctor may refer you to a specialist for a biopsy. This means they will take a small sample of tissue from the kidney to examine under a microscope.","In most cases, there’s nothing you can do to prevent interstitial nephritis. You can reduce your risk of getting it by avoiding medicines that can cause the condition.","Interstitial nephritis is caused by an underlying problem. Treatment depends on what is causing the condition. If the problem is an infection, your doctor will treat the infection. If a medicine is causing it, they will probably have you stop taking the medicine. In some cases, corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation) may help. Dialysis, a treatment that uses a special machine to filter the blood, is sometimes necessary.","In most cases, interstitial nephritis is a short-term problem. Treatment of the underlying problem cures the condition. Rarely it can lead to long-term or permanent kidney damage, such as chronic kidney failure. This is more likely to happen in older adults.","• What is causing my interstitial nephritis?

228,Intertrigo,https://familydoctor.org/condition/intertrigo/,"Intertrigo is a rash that usually affects the folds of the skin, where the skin rubs together or where it is often moist. This rubbing can cause a breakdown in the top layers of the skin, causing inflammation and a rash. The breakdown of skin makes it easier for bacteria or fungus to develop in this area. It can make the rash worse.

Intertrigo is most common in people who are overweight or who have diabetes. People who have splints, braces, or artificial limbs are also more likely to develop this rash.","Symptoms include a red or reddish-brown rash that can appear anywhere skin rubs together or traps wetness. This rash may burn or itch. The most common areas include:

• Between toes
• In the armpits
• In the groin area
• On the underside of the belly or breasts
• In the crease of the neck

Intertrigo can also affect the skin between the buttocks. The affected skin will often be very raw and may itch or ooze. In severe cases, intertrigo may cause a foul odor, and the skin may crack and bleed.","Skin folds sitting together and rubbing together causes intertrigo. This skin-on-skin friction creates a warm, moist environment. This environment invites an overgrowth of yeast, fungus, and bacteria. Intertrigo is not contagious. You cannot catch it from or pass it to another person.","The best way to know for sure is to ask your doctor. Your doctor will be able to tell if you have the rash by looking at your skin. No special tests are needed, but your doctor may take a sample to determine what type of bacteria or fungus may be present.","You can help prevent intertrigo by doing these things:

• Keep skin cool and dry.
• Do not wear tight shoes or clothing. Wear a bra that has good support.
• Wear clothes made with absorbent fabrics, such as cotton. Avoid nylon or other synthetic (manmade) fibers.
• If you are overweight, try to lose weight.
• After exercising, shower and dry off completely. Use a hair dryer with a cool setting to dry areas that can trap wetness, such as under your arms or breasts.","For mild cases, your doctor will tell you to keep the affected area of your skin dry and exposed to air. Your doctor may also want to prescribe a topical steroid cream. For certain cases, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic or antifungal cream. There are also antifungal powders that may help dry the skin. Talk to your doctor about which treatment is right for you.","Intertrigo may come and go. If you know that you are predisposed to getting this type of rash, take precautions. Before physical activity, treat the area with deodorant or with petroleum jelly. Do what you can to keep skin folds dry.","• What is the best way to keep from getting intertrigo again?

229,Intoeing,https://familydoctor.org/condition/intoeing/,"Most people’s feet point straight ahead or outward. Some people, however, have feet that point inward. This is called intoeing. It is also called “pigeon toes.” Intoeing is very common in young children. Most of the time, intoeing goes away without treatment. In a few children, it doesn’t get better on its own and must be treated.","When your child has intoeing, their feet point inward toward each other. The condition usually does not cause pain or any other symptoms.","It’s not exactly clear why some children develop intoeing. Family history could play a role. A lack of space in the womb can also cause some bones to rotate.

There are three causes of intoeing in healthy children.

Internal tibial torsion. This is the most common cause of intoeing. Internal tibial torsion is a twist in the tibia (the leg bone between the knee and the ankle). Some inward twist of the tibia is normal in babies. Usually this twist straightens out during the baby’s first year. In some children, the twist doesn’t straighten enough for the feet to point straight ahead or outward. These are the children who intoe when they begin walking. Leg bones usually continue to grow straighter until the child is 6 to 8 years old.

Excess femoral anteversion. Excess femoral anteversion is an inward twist in the femur (thigh bone). All babies are born with some inward twist of the thigh bone. This cause of intoeing usually shows up in children between 2 and 4 years of age. It can get worse during early childhood.

Metatarsus adductus. Metatarsus adductus is a curve in the foot. It causes the toe to point inward. It is commonly seen in newborns and infants. The curve in the foot is probably caused before the baby is born. The feet are pressed into this position inside the uterus. In 9 out of 10 children with this problem, the feet straighten as the child grows up.","Your doctor will look at your child’s foot. They will watch the way your child walks. They may order tests, such as X-rays. This will help them determine if any bones are rotated.",There is nothing that can be done to prevent intoeing in your child.,"Treatment for your child’s intoeing depends on the cause. In most cases, treatment is not necessary. The problems resolve over time.","Intoeing usually doesn’t cause serious problems, even if it doesn’t go away by itself. Sometimes children have problems getting shoes that fit, because of the curve of their feet. This fitting problem might make parents consider treatment for their child. Intoeing doesn’t cause arthritis or clumsiness.","• What is the likely cause of my child’s intoeing?
• How severe is my child’s intoeing?
• What is the best treatment option?
• Will my child need to wear a brace or special shoes?
• Is there anything I can do at home to help treat my child’s intoeing?
• Is it safe for my child to run, jump, etc.? What kinds of activities are okay?
• Will intoeing cause long-term problems for my child?

Braces and special shoes are not helpful. They are expensive. Children often don’t like to wear them, so they are seldom used. In a small number of children, the twist in the tibia doesn’t go away. Even if the twist remains, it hasn’t been shown to cause joint damage, arthritis, or problems with running and jumping.

Sometimes appearance is a problem. In this case, the treatment is surgery to cut the bones and turn (rotate) them outward, so the feet point straight. Very few children have to have this surgery. This is something that must be carefully discussed with your child’s doctor.

Excess femoral anteversion usually gets better by itself. In most children, the feet will point straight ahead or outward by the time they are 6 to 8 years old. Braces or shoe modifications typically won’t help. A few children with a very strong inward twist of the thigh bone may need to have surgery. The bone is cut and twisted outward, so the feet will point straight ahead. Surgery is only considered in very severe cases.

Your doctor may show you how to stretch the baby’s foot to help the foot get straighter. If the foot shape is very curved or the curve doesn’t go away, your doctor may treat your baby by putting casts or braces on their feet. This will help stretch them into a straight position. If the feet still have some curve after treatment, it will not cause any problems with running and playing. It is not painful."
230,Intussusception,https://familydoctor.org/condition/intussusception/,"Intussusception is a serious problem with the intestine. It occurs when one part of the intestine slides into another section. This causes the intestine to fold and become blocked. This prevents the passage of food through the intestine.

Intussusception can occur in adults. However, it is more common in infants and young children. It is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it may cause severe complications. These could include infection or even death.","The first sign of intussusception is severe abdominal pain. It could last for 15 to 20 minutes. It often gets worse as time goes on. Other signs your child may have intussusception include:

• Swelling in the abdomen
• Vomiting
• Irritability
• Bloody, mucus-like stools
• Fever
• Signs of shock (pale color, lack of energy, sweating)","There is no known cause for most cases of intussusception. Rarely, some conditions could lead to intussusception. These include:

• Appendicitis
• A viral infection
• A tumor or polyp (a growth inside the intestine)

Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal blockage in children between 3 months and 3 years of age. Most cases of intussusception occur in babies younger than 1 year of age. For unknown reasons, boys are affected more often than girls. Intussusception also occurs in older children and adults. However, there are fewer cases in these groups.",Your doctor will ask questions about your child’s symptoms and perform a physical exam. They may be able to feel the part of the intestine that is tender. Your doctor might order an ultrasound of the intestine. This imaging test uses sounds waves to create pictures to see if intussusception is causing your child’s symptoms. Your doctor may also order an abdominal X-ray.,"Since the there is no known cause, there is no way to prevent or avoid intussusception.","In many cases, intussusception is corrected with an air enema. Your doctor will use a small tube to fill your child’s rectum with air. The air pushes the folded intestine back into place. This clears the blockage. Your doctor may also want to get an X-ray of your child’s abdomen to see if the procedure was effective. Antibiotics can be used to treat an infection but are usually not needed. Sometimes the intestine doesn’t stop collapsing or it is caused by a tumor or polyp. In those cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the problem. Your child may need intravenous fluid to stay hydrated until treatment is complete.

Because intussusception is a medical emergency, seek medical help immediately if your child has symptoms of intussusception. When left untreated, intussusception may cause severe complications.","With prompt treatment, most children recover completely from intussusception. Occasionally, complications such as infection can occur if the intussusception is not treated quickly. If this happens, part of the bowel must be surgically removed. It is important to see your doctor right away if your child has symptoms of intussusception.

Intussusception sometimes returns, usually within 3 days. Keep close watch for returning symptoms.","• What is an air enema?

231,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),https://familydoctor.org/condition/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs/,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. It describes a group of symptoms that affect your large intestine with no known cause. IBS is common and occurs most often in women. People with a family history of IBS are more likely to have it.,"Common symptoms of IBS include:

• Abdominal pain and cramping that usually comes and goes, with relief after a bowel movement
• Bloating and gas
• Constipation and/or diarrhea
• Feeling like you need to have a second bowel movement right after finishing one (often with no results)
• Mucus in your stool

IBS symptoms vary for each person. You may have some or all of the symptoms listed above. You may even have normal bowel movements some days. Most people have mild symptoms, but some symptoms may be severe enough to affect your daily life.","There is no exact cause of IBS. Doctors believe that a mix of problems with your GI tract can lead to IBS. Health problems that are known to cause or worsen IBS include:

• A breakdown in how your brain sends signals to your intestines
• Trouble processing food through your GI tract
• Abnormal nerves in your GI tract that are more sensitive than normal
• A bacterial infection in your GI tract
• An increase or change in bacteria in your small intestine
• Reactions to certain foods or drinks
• Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety
• Extreme stress","There aren’t any tests that detect IBS. However, your doctor can look for a pattern in your symptoms. Also, your doctor can order tests to rule out other problems. These tests may include a blood test, a stool test, a colonoscopy, or X-rays of your lower GI tract.

Your doctor will perform an exam of your abdomen. They will check for bloating, pain, tenderness, or unusual sounds. Your doctor will ask you:

• If your pain improves or gets worse after a bowel movement
• How often you have a bowel movement
• What your bowel movements look like

You may be diagnosed with IBS if you’ve had symptoms weekly for 3 months and your symptoms started at least six months ago.","Since there isn’t a single cause for IBS, you can’t prevent or avoid it.","The best way to treat IBS is to make lifestyle changes. Treatment is different for everyone. You may need to try several options to find the one that works for you. Your doctor will guide you in which options to try. They may suggest you:

• Visit with a dietitian for tips on foods that are easy to digest. You may need to avoid caffeine, dairy, some fruits and vegetables, spicy and fatty foods, and foods made with gluten. Gluten foods include cereal, pasta, and processed foods.
• Eat small meals throughout the day.
• Increase your fiber a little at a time.
• Reduce your stress level.
• Get enough sleep.
• Exercise regularly.
• Try meditation or therapy.
• Take medicines. Your doctor will advise you about which ones may work for your type of IBS.","IBS is an ongoing problem. It can subside or flare up, based on your lifestyle. IBS does not require surgery, and it won’t shorten your life. If you have IBS, talk to your doctor about how to manage it. Symptoms often get better with treatment.","• What is a food diary and how does it help diagnose or manage IBS?
• What medicines are offered to treat IBS. What are their side effects?

232,Jock Itch,https://familydoctor.org/condition/jock-itch/,"Jock itch is a contagious fungal skin infection. It is caused by a fungus commonly found in gyms and locker rooms. Jock itch mostly affects males, although it is possible for females to get it, too. Jock itch appears as a skin rash around the groin, but can appear on your upper thigh, scrotum, penis, and anus. It is not serious. However, the itching can be extremely uncomfortable, even painful.","Jock itch rash appears red, purple, gray, tan, or white. It is usually raised and scaly around the edges. The rash itches. Like a blister, the rash can ooze fluid. The center of the rash is reddish-brown.","Jock itch is caused by exposure to the fungus. This can happen through direct skin-to-skin contact. In some cases, it happens if you have athlete’s foot (another fungal infection) when you have touched your feet and then your groin area. It also can be spread through infected clothing. The jock itch fungus grows in moist conditions, such as steamy public shower facilities and locker rooms, and in damp towels and clothing.","Your doctor can usually tell whether the rash is jock itch by the way it looks. They also will ask you questions about your exposure to places where the rash is spread. If your doctor is uncertain, they may scrape a sample of the rash off your body to send to the lab.","The best way to avoid or prevent jock itch is to carefully dry off and wear clean, dry clothes after using a public shower facility or locker room. Don’t share towels with others. Be sure to wash your clothing and towel after each exposure. Don’t leave sweaty or damp clothing stuffed into a bag. That is the perfect environment for a fungus to grow. If you have athlete’s foot, put your socks on first and wash your hands before putting on your underwear and clothing.

If you have jock itch, wash your clothes in hot, soapy water after each wear.","There are several things you can do on your own to treat jock itch

• Wash the rash with soap and water.
• Pat the area dry (allow plenty of time for it to dry).
• Apply an over-the-counter antifungal cream or powder to the rash in the morning and at night.
• Follow the directions on the cream packaging.
• Wear clean underwear each time you apply the cream.","Once you’ve had jock itch, you should take preventive actions to avoid it in the future. Remember to dry off completely and wear clean, dry clothes after spending time at a public shower facility or locker room. Wash and dry your workout clothes in hot, soapy water after each use.","• Is athlete’s foot the same infection that causes jock itch?

233,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/juvenile-rheumatoid-arthritis/,"Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a disease. It causes joint pain and swelling. It typically starts before the age of 16 and is long-term. The disease is sometimes called juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

If you’re having joint pain, tell your family doctor. Treating early can help prevent or reduce lifelong disability. Read More","Symptoms are different among children. Typically, joints become swollen, stiff, painful, and warm to the touch. They may start as early as 6 months of age. Your child may limp, especially in the morning when stiffness is the worst. They may have lower back pain and avoid normal activities. Symptoms may come and go. They may be mild or intense. Symptoms can last for a short time or for years. There are four types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms depend on the type:

• Pauciarticular or “few joints.” This is the most common type. It affects 4 or fewer joints. These are usually the knee, leg, wrist, or jaw. It also can cause inflammation in the eyes. This is called iritis and is common in girls younger than 7. If not treated properly, it can damage vision. Boys older than 8 who have this type of arthritis often have spine and hip problems. This type often goes away in about 50% of cases.
• Polyarticular or “many joints.” This type of arthritis affects 5 or more small joints. This includes joints in the fingers and hands. Symptoms often appear in the same joints on both sides of the body. Other symptoms include a low fever, feeling tired and poor appetite. Your child may have a small rash on the lower torso and upper arms and legs. Some children with this disease have anemia (iron deficiency). In rare cases, this type can cause a child’s organs, such as the liver or spleen, to swell. This type happens more often in girls than in boys. This type only goes away in fewer than half of children who have it.
• Systemic or Still’s disease. This type is the least common. It can affect several areas of the body, including joints and organs. Early symptoms include a rash, chills, and a high fever. Anemia is another common symptom. This type of arthritis is likely to cause long-term joint damage. About half of children who have this type recover. The rest have joint pain and stiffness for many years.
• Spondyloarthritis. This type affects the joints located between the bottom of the spine and pelvis. Symptoms resemble adult arthritis.

Serious cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis can affect a child’s growth. See your doctor if your child has symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.",The cause of the disease is not known. Doctors suspect it is caused by an autoimmune illness. This is when your body attacks and destroys its own healthy tissue.,Your child’s doctor will ask about your child’s symptoms and do a physical exam. It can be hard to diagnose. You doctor may do an X-ray or blood test to rule out other illnesses. X-rays also can show more severe damage or deformities. Your child’s doctor may want to take a sample of fluid from an actively inflamed joint or spinal fluid. It may take a few months before your doctor makes a diagnosis. This is so they can watch your child’s symptoms over time.,"Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis cannot be prevented or avoided. Certain lifestyle changes can lessen your child’s discomfort. This includes exercise (walking, biking, and swimming). Warm up before exercising. A physical therapist can offer your child a plan for home exercises. Ask your doctor about seeing a physical therapist for home exercise to reduce pain.","Your doctor may recommend medicine for pain and swelling. This includes both prescription and over-the-counter medicine. Over-the-counter medicine includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID.) This includes ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin). It reduces joint swelling.

If this does not help, your child’s doctor may suggest more powerful NSAIDs. This would be a prescription. For severe symptoms, your child’s doctor may need steroid treatments to reduce swelling. Your child’s doctor may prescribe medicine to treat an autoimmune illness. These medicines slow your child’s immune system to reduce further joint damage.

Children rarely need surgery to treat the disease. Badly damaged joints may require soft tissue surgery. This is if the joints are bent or deformed. Joint replacement surgery can help badly damaged joints. With proper treatment, many children lead full, normal, and symptom-free lives.","Whether your child’s symptoms come and go or are long-lasting some things can help. This includes:

• Taking a hot shower. Use a hot or cold pack or sleep in a warm bed to relieve stiffness.
• Stretching and do range-of-motion exercises. This reduces joint stiffness and improves flexibility. Exercise at the same time every day. Make it easy. Do it while watching TV or with family members.
• Taking medicine at the right time and consistently. Have your child take their medicine at the same time as another activity. This makes it easy to remember.

Being active is important in managing the disease. Children who have the disease may need emotional support. This is important in managing the anger and sadness of having the disease.","• Will NSAIDs and other medicines cause ulcers or side effects?
• Are certain sports better than others?
• Can contact sports (football, basketball) cause more harm?
• Will this cause mobility problems for my child when they are older?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

234,Keloids (Raised Scars),https://familydoctor.org/condition/keloids/,"Keloids are a type of raised scar. They occur where the skin has healed after an injury. They can grow to be much larger than the original injury that caused the scar. They are not at all common, but are more likely for people who have dark skin.

Anything that can cause a scar can cause a keloid. This includes being burned, cut, or having severe acne. Keloids can also develop after you get a body piercing, a tattoo, or have surgery. Keloids sometimes show up 3 months or more after your skin is injured. Some continue to grow for years.","Keloids can have the following characteristics:

• Appear and grow slowly. It can take 3 months up to a year before you see the first signs of a keloid. Then it takes weeks or months for it to grow. Sometimes, they continue to grow slowly for years.
• Begin as a raised pink, red, or purple scar. A keloid is usually a raised scar with a flat surface. The color tends to darken with time. It usually ends up being darker than the person’s skin, with the border being darker than the center.
• Feel different than the surrounding skin. Some keloids feel soft and doughy. Others are hard and rubbery.
• Cause pain, itching, or tenderness. When they are growing, some keloids may be itchy, tender, or painful to the touch. These symptoms usually stop once the keloid stops growing.

Keloids can form anywhere on the body. They are most common on the neck, shoulders, chest, back, and ears. They can range in size from smaller than an inch to 12 inches or more.","After your skin is injured, your cells try to repair it by forming a scar. In some people, the scar tissue keeps forming long after the wound heals. This extra scar tissue causes the raised area on your skin. Doctors still aren’t sure why some people’s skin scars this way.

Many different types of skin injuries can lead to a keloid. These include:

• puncture wounds
• surgical scars
• severe acne
• chicken pox
• insect bites
• injection sites
• piercings
• tattoos

Some people are more likely to develop a keloid when they scar. You are more likely to develop a keloid if:

• You are Black, Latino, or Asian.
• You are younger than 30 years of age.
• You are pregnant.
• You are a teenager going through puberty.
• You have a history of keloids in your family.

People who have darker skin are 15% to 20% more likely to develop keloids.",Your doctor can diagnose a keloid by looking at the raised scar on your skin. Sometimes he or she may do a skin biopsy to rule out other types of skin growths.,"People who are more likely to get keloids may decide not to get a body piercing or tattoo. If you get your ears pierced, you should wear special pressure earrings to reduce scarring on your earlobes.","The goal of treatment is to flatten, soften, or shrink the raised scar. Keloids can be hard to get rid of. Sometimes they return after treatment. Many doctors will use a combination of treatments for the best results. Treatments include the following:

• Corticosteroid shots. The medicine in these shots helps shrink the scar.
• Freezing the scar. Called cryotherapy, this can be used to reduce the hardness and size of the scar. It works best on small keloids.
• Wearing silicone sheets or gel over the scar. This can help flatten the keloid.
• Laser therapy. This can help flatten the keloid. It also can fade the color.
• Surgical removal. This involves cutting out the keloid. Most keloids will return after this treatment.
• Pressure treatment. After keloid surgery, keeping pressure on the area reduces blood flow. This can prevent a keloid from returning.

Different treatments work for different people. Talk to your doctor about which treatment option is right for you.","Keloids are not harmful to your health, but having them can be upsetting to you. You may be embarrassed about how they look. This can hurt your self-esteem. Most people who get treatment for keloids do so because they don’t like the way they look. Luckily, the treatments that are available can improve the way the keloids look, even if they don’t get rid of the scars completely.","• Why did I get a keloid?

235,Keratosis Pilaris,https://familydoctor.org/condition/keratosis-pilaris/,"Keratosis pilaris is a common, harmless skin condition that causes small bumps to appear on the skin. These bumps can appear anywhere, but they’re often found on the upper arms and thighs. Some people have so many bumps that they extend onto the forearms or lower legs.","This condition may make your skin look like you have patches of “goose bumps.” The bumps are often the color of your skin. They may also look white, red, pinkish-purple on fair skin, or brownish-black on dark skin. The bumps can feel rough and dry like sandpaper. They may itch, but they don’t hurt. If you have keratosis pilaris on your face, it may look like acne, and you may look flushed. Additionally, the skin on your face may be dry and chapped. Some people with keratosis pilaris only get a few flesh-colored bumps while others have noticeable bumps that can look like a rash.

The area of your skin that is affected by keratosis pilaris may become darker (hyperpigmentation) or lighter (hypopigmentation) than the surrounding skin. This can happen if you scratch or pick at the bumps.","Keratosis pilaris occurs when dead skin cells clog the hair follicles (also called pores) in your skin. It’s not caused by a fungus, bacteria, or a virus. It’s not contagious. It occurs more often during the winter months when the air is dry, and it tends to improve in warmer months when humidity is higher.

This condition can occur at any age and affect anyone. It usually appears before age 2 or during the teenage years, however it can worsen during pregnancy and after childbirth. Keratosis pilaris generally affects women more often than men, and it may disappear or improve with age.

You are more likely to develop keratosis pilaris if you have:

• A family history of it
• Asthma
• Dry skin
• Eczema (also called atopic dermatitis)
• Excess body weight
• Hay fever","Your doctor will be able to tell if you have keratosis pilaris by looking at your skin and talking with you about your symptoms. In some cases, however, your doctor may need to perform a skin biopsy to ensure a correct diagnosis.",null,"There is no cure for keratosis pilaris. But you can minimize your symptoms by following your doctor’s recommendations. He or she may suggest you:

• Use a moisturizing lotion to soothe your skin.
• Exfoliate your skin. This is when you use a loofah or rough washcloth to gently remove dead skin cells from the surface of your skin.
• Apply skin creams that contain certain ingredients to help soften the skin and loosen dead skin cells. These ingredients could include urea, lactic acid, glycolic acid (alpha hydroxy), salicylic acid, or tretinoin.
• Use steroid creams to reduce redness and itching.

It may be weeks or months before you see results of treatment, so be patient. Even if the bumps go away, keep your treatment plan going since keratosis pilaris often returns when treatment is stopped.","Here are some tips to help improve the appearance of your skin:

• Wash your skin gently. Avoid scrubbing the affected area. Use warm (not hot) water and a mild soap (some brand names: Cetaphil, Lubriderm, Purpose). Avoid deodorant or soaps with a strong fragrance because the perfumes used in these products can dry out your skin.
• Pat dry your skin after showering or bathing while being careful not to rub.
• Use a moisturizer after every shower or bath. Apply it within 5 minutes of getting out, while your skin is still damp.
• Apply moisturizer 2 to 3 times a day. Moisturizers that contain urea (some brand names: Eucerin, Lubriderm) are especially helpful because they soften dry, rough skin.

236,Kidney Cysts,https://familydoctor.org/condition/kidney-cysts/,"The kidneys remove waste from your blood. They do this by filtering the blood and making urine. As people get older, sacs filled with fluid can form in the kidneys. These sacs are called “cysts.” They are usually small, oval or round thin-walled sacs with watery fluid in them.

Kidney cysts are almost always benign (not cancerous). Usually, the cysts don’t cause any problems. In fact, people can go through life without even knowing that they have them.

Some people have kidney cysts caused by an inherited disease called polycystic kidney disease (PKD). This disease can cause symptoms such as high blood pressure, pain in the back and side, blood in the urine, or frequent kidney infections. Not all people who have PKD will have these symptoms.","If you have kidney cysts, you may have these symptoms:

• Pain on your side between your ribs and your hip.
• Pain in your belly or back.
• A fever.
• Frequent urination.
• Blood in your urine or dark urine.

If you’re having any of these symptoms, you should contact your doctor.","If your kidney cysts are caused by PKD, then they are inherited. This means you have them because they run in your family. For most people, though, this is not the case. Doctors aren’t sure why the cysts form for them. It could be that the kidney surface weakens over time. This could explain why cysts on the kidneys are most common in people who are age 50 and older.","Almost all kidney cysts are found on imaging tests that create a picture of your internal organs. These tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Sometimes kidney cysts are found when one of these tests is performed for another reason.","Because doctors aren’t sure what causes them, kidney cysts cannot be prevented or avoided.","If you’re not having any of the symptoms listed in the “Symptoms” section, and your kidney cyst is small, you may not need any treatment. Your doctor might want to check the cyst again with a CT scan in 6 to 12 months.

If you start having problems, your doctor might want you to have a CT or MRI scan of your kidney to see if the cyst is growing.

If the cyst on your kidney is large or if it contains calcifications (hard, stony pieces) or dense tissue, you might need to have CT scans every so often. This allows your doctor to watch for changes in the cyst.

If your cyst is blocking blood flow or urine flow, your doctor may have to treat it. He or she may use a procedure called sclerotherapy. During sclerotherapy, your doctor will use a long needle to drain the cyst. He or she will then fill the cyst with an alcohol solution to harden kidney tissue.

If your cyst isn’t causing any problems, it probably won’t need to be removed. If it is getting larger or if it’s causing problems, your doctor may send you to a urologist (a doctor who has special training in kidney problems).","If you are over 50 years old, there is a good chance you have cysts on your kidneys and don’t realize it. You may never realize it because you may never have symptoms. And most kidney cysts do not cause any problems.

If you do have symptoms (back or belly pain, blood in your urine, etc.), see your doctor. He or she can advise you on a treatment or ways to help relieve your symptoms.","• What treatment is best for me?
• Is there a cause for my kidney cysts?
• Are there any medicines that I should take?
• Will I need surgery?
• Should I see a urologist?
• Are there any complications I should watch out for?

237,Kidney Infection Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/kidney-infection/,"A kidney infection results when bacteria get into one or both of your kidneys. The medical name for it is pyelonephritis.

Your kidneys filter blood, remove waste, and produce urine. They’re part of the urinary tract. This group of organs includes your kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Kidneys are shaped like beans about the size of your fist. They’re located on either side of your spine, and are partially protected by your lower rib cage.","Common symptoms of a kidney infection include:

• Fever
• Pain in your back, side, or groin
• Chills
• Nausea and/or vomiting
• A feeling of needing to urinate, even though you just did
• Painful, burning, and/or frequent urination
• Cloudy or bad-smelling urine
• Blood or pus in your urine
• Sepsis (if left untreated)

Symptoms can vary by age. Babies and older people might not have the common symptoms. Instead, they may have slurred speech, dizziness, or confusion. Get medical care right away if you have any of these symptoms.","The main cause of a kidney infection is Escherichia coli (E. coli). This bacterium can travel to your kidney(s) from somewhere else in your urinary tract, such as your bladder. It’s very common to get a kidney infection if you already have a urinary tract infection (UTI). Women tend to get kidney infections and UTIs more often than men. This is due to the shape of female anatomy. Other causes include kidney stones and an enlarged prostate.","It’s important to detect and treat a kidney infection right away. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms. They will probably ask you to give a urine and/or blood sample, too. In some cases, your doctor might order other tests. These include an ultrasound, an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scans, or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests will provide pictures of your urinary tract organs.","You can help prevent a kidney infection or UTI if you:

• Drink enough water
• Urinate after sex
• Don’t hold urine in
• Avoid using douches and scented products in your genital area
• Wipe your genital area from front to back (for women)
• Treating or avoiding constipation (trouble passing stool [poop]). Constipation is not a symptom of kidney infection but it can increase your chance of having bacteria in your urinary tract because it can make it difficult to empty your bladder fully.

Although anyone can get a kidney infection, some people are at greater risk. You’re more likely to get a kidney infection if you:

• Are pregnant
• Have diabetes
• Already have a UTI
• Have an oddly shaped urinary tract
• Have a kidney stone
• Have an enlarged prostate (for men)
• Have a weakened immune system
• Have to use a catheter to remove urine from your bladder
• Have nerve or spinal cord damage
• Have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a condition where urine can flow up or down your ureters","Antibiotics are the main treatment for kidney infections. There are different kinds. Your doctor will decide which type is best for you. Most of the time, antibiotics are provided as a pill. In severe cases of kidney infection, you may need an IV (a catheter in your arm) to get the medicine. You also may need to stay in the hospital. This is more common if you’re dehydrated and/or older.

You always should follow your doctor’s instructions about your medicine. It could take several weeks to get rid of the infection, even if your symptoms go away. Your doctor might perform a follow-up test to confirm the infection is gone. They also might prescribe other medicine or treatment to address the cause or a related issue.",Most people who have a kidney infection recover. You can get kidney infections more than once. Talk to your doctor about how to help prevent future infections.,"• Why do you think I got a kidney infection?
• How much water should I drink every day to stay hydrated?
• What is the best medicine for me to treat my kidney infection?
• Once I start medicine, how long will it take for my symptoms to go away?

238,Kidney Stones,https://familydoctor.org/condition/kidney-stones/,"Healthy kidneys remove waste products from your blood. These waste products leave your body in the urine your kidneys make. When the waste products don’t properly leave your kidneys, it can result in kidney stones.

A kidney stone is a hard, solid lump that forms in your kidney. The lump can be as small as a tiny pebble or it can be much bigger. It’s made from the waste products in your urine.

A kidney stone may stay in your kidney. It also may travel from your kidneys down the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the ureters, bladder, and the urethra. If the stone is big enough, it can get stuck in your kidney or urinary tract. This can be very painful.","Kidney stones can cause a severe cramping pain in your lower back or side. The pain usually moves down toward your abdomen, groin, or genitals as the stone moves down the urinary tract. Other symptoms may include:

• Nausea and vomiting
• Cloudy or bloody urine
• Fever
• Feeling like you need to go to the bathroom more often than usual","There are four types of kidney stones. The calcium stone is the most common type. Calcium that isn’t used by your bones and muscles goes to your kidneys. Usually, the kidneys will get rid of the extra calcium through the urine. Calcium stones occur when some of the calcium remains in the kidneys and collects over time.

A struvite stone is more common in women. It usually forms after a chronic urinary tract infection. These stones are usually made of ammonia.

A uric acid stone forms when there is too much uric acid in the urine. You may be at risk for this type of stone if you eat a high-protein diet or if you’ve received chemotherapy.

A cystine stone isn’t very common. The disease that causes cystine stones to form runs in families and is called cystinuria.","Most of the time, you’ll be able to pass your kidney stone without the help of a doctor. If your kidney stone gets stuck in the urinary tract, you may need your doctor’s help.

To determine if you have a kidney stone, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. He or she will take a sample of your urine. Your doctor will order images of your kidneys and urinary tract.","Most people who have kidney stones have a 50% chance of developing another kidney stone within 10 years. But there are things you can do to lower your risk:

• Drink at least 2 liters of fluids (water is best) per day. Your doctor may have you measure your urine output to be sure you’re drinking the right amount of fluids.
• Don’t eat more than 1,500 mg of salt per day (about 1 teaspoon). This includes salt in pre-packaged food. Check nutrition labels to see how much salt (sodium) is in your food.
• Try not to eat more than 2 servings of meat per day. Each serving should be no more than 6 to 8 ounces.

There are several risk factors for kidney stones, including:

• Not drinking enough fluids, especially water
• Family history of kidney stones
• Eating a diet high in protein and sodium but low in fiber
• Being a man
• Being between 20 and 70 years of age
• Being bedridden or immobile for a long period of time
• Taking certain medicines
• Being overweight","If the stone is small enough, you might be able to pass it in your urine. Your doctor can give you medicine to help with the pain. Your doctor may also suggest you filter your urine and submit any stones for further testing or analysis.

If the stone is too big or is causing an infection, your doctor may intervene. They may suggest a procedure or refer you to a urologist. They may use a special machine that uses shock waves to break up the stone into smaller pieces. This is called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, or SSWL.

A urologist (urinary tract surgical specialist) can put a very thin instrument through your urethra and into your bladder and ureters to find the stone. He or she can then pull it out or break it into smaller pieces. If a doctor does this, you will be given medicine to numb the area first.

Surgery is also an option and is sometimes the only way to get rid of a kidney stone.","If you have had more than one kidney stone, your doctor might send you to a specialist to find the exact cause of your stones. Some people need medicine to keep from getting another kidney stone.","• What treatment is best for me?
• What pain medicine should I take?
• Will I need surgery?
• Will the stone pass by itself?
• Should I change my diet?
• Are there any other lifestyle changes I should make?
• Will I get more kidney stones in the future?
• Are my children at higher risk of kidney stones?
• When should I call my doctor?
• If my pain is bad enough, should I go to the emergency room?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Kidney Stones

239,Labyrinthitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/labyrinthitis/,"Labyrinthitis (say: “lab-uh-rinth-eye-tus”) is a condition that affects a part of the inner ear called the labyrinth. Normally, the labyrinth helps you keep your balance. When it gets swollen, the labyrinth doesn’t work properly. This makes it so that your brain doesn’t get the right balance signals. Labyrinthitis can make you feel like you are falling or spinning, even though you aren’t.","Symptoms of labyrinthitis can range from mild to severe. You may have symptoms as soon as you wake up in the morning, or they may occur suddenly throughout the day. Common symptoms include the following:

• Dizziness.
• Feeling that you are spinning (also called vertigo).
• Eye jerking (also called nystagmus).
• Nausea or vomiting.
• Hearing loss in one ear.
• Ringing in your ears (also called tinnitus).

If you have symptoms of labyrinthitis, talk to your doctor. Other conditions can cause similar symptoms. Get medical care right away if you experience vertigo with a fever above 101˚F, fainting, convulsions, slurred speech, paralysis, double vision, or severe vomiting.","The swelling in the inner ear that causes labyrinthitis often results from an infection. For example, people often develop labyrinthitis after having an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold.",Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and examine you. Your doctor may do some tests to be sure that another condition isn’t causing your labyrinthitis.,"Because labyrinthitis is caused by an underlying condition, you can reduce your risk of getting it. For example, wash your hands regularly and try to avoid germs during cold and flu season. Limiting your exposure to these illnesses will reduce your risk of labyrinthitis.

You may also reduce your risk by not drinking large amounts of alcohol or smoking.","Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (also called NSAIDs) are sometimes used to reduce swelling. These include ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). Steroid medicines are another option to reduce swelling. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine to relieve nausea, vomiting and dizziness. However, even without treatment, the symptoms of labyrinthitis will usually go away after several weeks.

If you have vomiting that is severe and uncontrollable, you may need to spend a short time in the hospital to prevent dehydration.","Your most severe symptoms will probably get better after the first week. Most people are completely better within 2 to 3 months. Sensitivity to motion may be a problem for several years, especially for older adults. In rare cases, people may have permanent hearing loss. This is less likely if labyrinthitis is treated promptly.","• Will I lose my hearing?
• Is there anything I can do to make the dizziness stop?
• When should I call the doctor?
• If the dizziness gets really bad or I start throwing up, should I go to the emergency room?

240,Lactose intolerance: Your guide to prevention,https://familydoctor.org/condition/lactose-intolerance/,"Lactose intolerance is your body’s inability to digest foods with lactose in them. Lactose is the sugar found in milk and foods made with milk (ice cream, cheese). Sometimes, this condition is called dairy product intolerance, lactase deficiency or milk intolerance. Lactose intolerance typically causes discomfort in your stomach. For example, After eating foods with lactose in them, you may feel sick to your stomach. It is a common problem. Babies have the lactase enzyme, so they are not lactose intolerant (although premature babies may not have the enzyme). Lactose intolerance may first appear in children at the age of 3.

There are three types of lactose intolerance:

• Primary lactose intolerance: This represents people who used to drink milk as infants. But as they reduced their milk consumption, their guts slowed their lactase production. By the time they become adults, they find it difficult to digest milk and other dairy products.
• Secondary lactose intolerance: This represents people who experience an injury or illness to their gut, which changes their production of lactase considerably. Such illnesses include Crohn’s disease and celiac disease.
• Congenital lactose intolerance: This represents people who have a genetic reason for having the condition. It is rare and both parents must have this gene to pass it onto their children.","• Nausea
• Stomach cramps/pain
• Bloating
• Diarrhea
• Gurgling in your stomach

The amount of lactose an individual can tolerate varies. Some can consume small amounts without symptoms, while others need to completely avoid dairy.","• Lactose intolerance often develops in adulthood as lactase production naturally decreases, although it can also occur in children and infants.
• Lactose intolerance is not a milk allergy.
• It’s not life-threatening.
• Lactose intolerance is more common in certain ethnic groups, including individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American descent.

Lactose intolerance is caused by the missing enzyme, lactase. Lactase lives in your small intestine. Some people don’t have it because of infection, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. In rare cases, it is genetic.","Most people suspect they are lactose intolerant when they experience stomach upset after digesting foods containing dairy. If you believe you are lactose intolerant, here’s how to reduce your risk for stomach upset:

• Avoid eating or touching any foods with dairy. Sometimes dairy is an ingredient you wouldn’t suspect to be in a certain meal or snack. If you are at a restaurant, you’re your server about the ingredients in the food you order. Sometimes you can still order the dish without dairy (skip the cheese, for example). Be sure to tell your server you cannot have dairy.
• Read the ingredients and all other important warnings on labels of packaged goods. Even if a product doesn’t contain dairy, it may have been manufactured in a facility that is exposed to it. Some products come with a warning that it was made near other products containing dairy.
• Tell all your health care providers you are lactose intolerant.

Carry the medicine you need to manage your lactose intolerance. Some medicines can be taken in advance of consuming dairy to minimize discomfort. Some medicines are designed to provide relief if you chose to or accidentally consumed dairy.

A doctor can diagnose lactose intolerance through one or multiple tests.

• The milk challenge: This is the easiest way to diagnose lactose intolerance. Avoid eating and drinking all dairy products for several days. This includes milk, ice cream, and cheese. Drink a glass of milk. If you have stomach problems an hour later, you are probably lactose intolerant. If you aren’t sure, see your doctor. Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and your history with dairy products.
• A blood or saliva test: This allows your doctor to test for lactose intolerance or the gene. You will be asked to drink a beverage with lactose in it. Two hours later, your doctor will draw your blood or collect a saliva sample to send to a lab.
• A hydrogen breath test. This can be done in a hospital, lab, or your doctor’s office. You will be asked to drink a beverage that contains lactose. After 15 minutes, you’ll be asked to blow into balloon-like bags every 15 minutes. The air inside the bags will be tested for hydrogen. If your air contains a lot of hydrogen, you are probably lactose intolerant. The full test takes about 2 hours.
• Stool acidity test (where you provide a stool sample). This is a common test for infants and young children.
• Genetics test. This involves taking a sample of your genes through a blood or a saliva (spit) sample.
• A surgical biopsy of your intestine. This is done at a hospital. It requires anesthesia (medicine that puts you into a deep sleep). Your doctor will make a small cut in your stomach near your small intestine. He or she will take a sample. It will be sent to a lab.","You can reduce stomach discomfort and other symptoms of lactose intolerance by doing the following:

• Cut back on the amount of dairy you eat or drink. One serving of milk should be ¼ or ½ cup.
• Have food in your stomach (not more dairy).
• Wait several hours before having more dairy.
• Choose foods with less lactose. Those include buttermilk and hard cheeses (cheddar, parmesan, Romano), ice cream, and goat cheese.
• Substitute soy or nondairy products. Use a nondairy coffee creamer.
• Take supplements that help you digest lactose (Lactaid). These are pills you can chew before you eat or drink dairy.
• Look for lactose-free foods in the grocery store.
• Eat yogurt (if you can). Yogurt helps with stomach upset. Many different probiotics can lessen the symptoms of lactose intolerance, so these could be a good supplement if you do not tolerate yogurt.
• Talk to your doctor about vitamin supplements. Eat foods that are naturally high in calcium. These include leafy greens, oysters, sardines, canned salmon, shrimp, and broccoli.
• Choose orange juice and cereals with added calcium.
• Eliminate the possibility of cross-contamination in food preparation areas by asking your host, restaurant server, and reading package labels.",null,null,"• How should I handle avoiding lactose intolerance?
• Are the symptoms usually the same and same intensity?
• Is lactose intolerance inherited?
• Do symptoms appear in a certain order to give you some warning?
• Can you develop lactose intolerance later in life?
• Could gas, bloating, diarrhea, and pain be a sign of something else?
• Can you build up a tolerance for lactose as you age?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Lactose intolerance doesn’t have a cure, but symptoms can be managed through dietary changes, such as avoiding high-lactose foods or using lactase enzyme supplements. Watch what you eat and drink to reduce stomach pain, gas, and diarrhea.

Living with stomach pain, gas, and bloating is uncomfortable. Monitor what you eat and drink. Limit your dairy to make you feel more comfortable. Lactose intolerance can potentially lead to nutrient deficiencies if it prevents individuals from getting enough calcium and vitamin D from dairy sources. Ask your doctor for the best methods of improving your calcium and vitamin D consumption.

Consider these milk substitutes, which may be easier to digest:

• Buttermilk and cheeses, including aged hard cheeses (these foods contain less lactose than milk)
• Fermented milk products, such as yogurt
• Goat’s milk
• Lactose-free milk and milk products
• Lactase-treated cow’s milk for older children and adults
• Soy formulas for infants younger than 2 years
• Soy or rice milk for toddlers"
241,Latex Allergy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/latex-allergy/,"Natural rubber latex comes from a liquid in tropical rubber trees. This liquid is processed to make many of the following rubber products used at home and at work:

• Balloons
• Dishwashing gloves
• Waistbands on clothing
• Rubber toys
• Pacifiers and baby-bottle nipples
• Rubber bands
• Adhesive tape and bandages
• Diapers and sanitary pads
• Condoms

In addition, many medical and dental supplies contain latex, including:

• Gloves
• Blood pressure cuffs
• Urinary catheters
• Dental dams and material used to fill root canals
• Tourniquets
• Equipment for resuscitation

You can find non-latex substitutes for all of these latex-containing items.

The protein in rubber can cause an allergic reaction in some people. This reaction can range from sneezing to anaphylactic shock. This type of shock is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.

The thin, stretchy latex rubber in gloves, condoms, and balloons is high in this protein. It causes more allergic reactions than products made of hard latex rubber (such as tires). Some latex gloves are coated with cornstarch powder. Latex protein particles can stick to the cornstarch and fly into the air when the gloves are taken off. In places where gloves are being put on and removed frequently, the air may contain many latex particles.","Latex allergy can be mild or severe, with symptoms such as:

• Itchy, red, watery eyes
• Sneezing or runny nose
• Coughing
• Rash or hives
• Chest tightness
• Shortness of breath

Some people who wear latex gloves get bumps, sores, cracks, or red, raised areas on their hands. These symptoms usually appear 12 to 36 hours after contact with latex. Changing to non-latex gloves, using glove liners, and paying more attention to hand care can help relieve these symptoms.

A person who is highly allergic to latex can also have a life-threatening allergic reaction, called anaphylactic shock. Symptoms include:

• Difficulty breathing
• Dizziness
• Confusion
• Wheezing
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Rapid or weak pulse
• Loss of consciousness

Someone having an anaphylactic reaction needs immediate medical attention.","Latex products are everywhere. Anyone can develop a latex allergy. Health care workers and rubber industry workers seem to have the highest risk for latex allergy. Health care workers who have hay fever have an especially high chance of developing a latex allergy. This is because 25% of all health care workers who have hay fever show signs of being sensitive to latex.

Other people at higher risk for latex allergy are:

• People who have had many operations (especially in childhood)
• People who have spina bifida (a birth defect that affects the development of the spine)
• People who have a food allergy","If you think you have a latex allergy, see a doctor. You should preferably see one with experience in treating latex allergy. Your doctor will take a detailed history and may confirm the diagnosis with a blood test. Skin testing is usually not used to test for latex allergy, except in some specialized centers. It can cause severe reactions if it isn’t done by an experienced person.","If you are a health care worker or a patient, everyone around you should wear powder-free latex gloves or non-latex gloves. If you are a health care worker, compare different kinds of non-latex gloves to find the ones that are best for you.

Always wear or carry a medical alert bracelet, necklace, or keychain. This will warn emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and doctors that you are allergic to latex. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for an epinephrine self-injection pen. You will use this pen in case of a serious reaction. You may wish to carry non-latex gloves with you all the time. Emergency personnel can use these if you need medical attention.

If you are exposed to latex at your job, tell your employer and co-workers about your latex allergy. Avoid latex gloves completely if you’re not at risk for blood and body fluid contamination. Use powder-free gloves if latex gloves are preferable. These measures will help keep others from becoming allergic to latex.","Although there is no treatment for latex allergy, you can reduce your risk of reaction by avoiding direct contact with latex. Take steps to find out which products in your environment contain latex. Then, find substitutes you can use for those products. It’s also important to avoid breathing in latex particles from powdered gloves or other sources.","Take steps to educate yourself and others about latex allergy. Work to support workplace policies, industry practices, and government legislation that promote the safe use of latex and non-latex alternatives.","• Latex is a rubber product. Am I at risk for other rubber allergies?
• What products contain latex? How do I avoid these?
• How do I make sure that all members of my health care team know about my latex allergy?
• How do I know if my allergic reactions are getting worse?
• Could I be at risk for anaphylaxis? Do I need to carry epinephrine?
• Do I need a medical alert bracelet? Where do I get one?
• I’m sexually active. What’s a good alternative to latex condoms?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Latex Allergy

Therefore, some foods may also cause an allergic reaction in people who are allergic to latex. The most common of these foods are banana, avocado, chestnut, kiwi fruit, and passion fruit. Although many other foods can cause an allergic reaction, avoiding all of them might cause nutrition problems. Therefore, it’s recommended that you avoid only the foods that have already given you an allergic reaction."
242,Leprosy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/leprosy/,"Leprosy is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) bacteria. It can affect the skin and the nerves of the hands and feet as well as the eyes and the lining of the nose. In some cases, leprosy can also affect other organs, such as the kidneys and testicles in men. If left untreated, leprosy can cause deformities of the hands and feet, blindness, and kidney failure.

Leprosy is also called Hansen’s disease.","Leprosy progresses very slowly. Most people who have leprosy do not develop symptoms for at least a year after being infected by the bacteria. In most cases, it takes 5 to 7 years for symptoms to develop.

Leprosy damages the nerves and muscles. It may cause sores, lesions, lumps, and bumps to appear on the skin. There are 2 types of leprosy: tuberculoid leprosy and lepromatous leprosy. Tuberculoid leprosy is the less severe and less contagious form of the disease. Lepromatous leprosy is more severe and generalized. It is also more contagious. This type of leprosy may affect organs such as the kidneys, testicles (in men), eyes, and nose.

Depending on the type of leprosy, symptoms may include:

• Skin sores or lesions that do not heal after several months (lesions are flat or slightly elevated and light in color or slightly red)
• Skin lumps and bumps that can be disfiguring
• Numbness of the skin because of damage to the nerves under the skin
• Muscle weakness","Doctors aren’t exactly sure how leprosy spreads. Leprosy is not very contagious. You can’t catch it by touching someone who has the disease. Most cases of leprosy are from repeated and long-term contact with someone who has the disease. Doctors believe that leprosy might be passed from person to person. This happens by breathing in droplets that get into the air when infected people cough or sneeze. Most people who come in contact with M. leprae do not develop leprosy. However, people whose immune systems are weakened from chronic disease (such as diabetes, HIV, AIDS, or heart disease) may be more likely to develop leprosy. This is because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight the bacteria.

Children are more likely to develop leprosy than adults.",Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history and the symptoms you are experiencing. They will probably want to remove a tiny piece of the affected skin (called a biopsy) to check for the M. leprae bacteria.,"Even though the risk of catching leprosy is very low, you can still reduce your risk. The best way to prevent leprosy is to avoid contact with body fluids and the rashes of people who have leprosy.","Leprosy is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics can kill all the M. leprae bacteria in your body, but they can’t reverse nerve damage or deformities caused by leprosy. This is why early treatment is important. You may need to take antibiotics for 6 months or longer, depending on the severity of your infection.","If left untreated, leprosy can cause permanent damage to the nerves in the fingers, toes, hands, and feet. This may affect a person’s ability to feel pain and temperature in these areas of the body. When you can’t feel your fingers or toes, you may accidentally burn, cut, or hurt yourself. Repeated injuries and nerve damage can cause muscle weakness, deformities, and even the loss of fingers and toes. Untreated leprosy can also cause swelling, and skin sores and lesions that are more severe.

If leprosy damages the lining of the nose, it can cause frequent nosebleeds and constant stuffiness. If leprosy damages your eyes, it can lead to glaucoma and even blindness. Lepromatous leprosy can reduce the amount of the male hormone testosterone and sperm counts in men. This can lead to erectile dysfunction and infertility. In more severe cases, leprosy can also damage the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure.","• What antibiotic is best for me?

243,Leukemia | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/leukemia/,"Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infections. Inside your bones is a substance called bone marrow. This is where the blood cells are made. When you have leukemia, the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells. The abnormal cells build up and crowd out healthy blood cells. This makes it hard for your blood to do what it is supposed to do.

There are 4 main types of leukemia:

• Acute lymphocytic leukemia
• Acute myeloid leukemia
• Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
• Chronic myeloid leukemia

Acute types develop and grow quickly. Chronic types grow slowly. Lymphocytic or myeloid refers to which kind of white blood cells are abnormal. Each type of leukemia has different symptoms and is treated differently.

Leukemia is most common in adults over age 60. But it also happens to children. It is among the most common forms of cancer in children under age 15.","The symptoms of leukemia depend on which kind it is. Symptoms of chronic leukemia tend to come on slowly over time. They include:

• Fatigue
• Shortness of breath
• Swollen lymph nodes
• Frequent infections

Some people with chronic leukemia don’t have any symptoms. They don’t know they have it until they get a blood test incidentally.

Symptoms of acute leukemia include:

• Fatigue, lack of energy
• Shortness of breath
• Pale skin
• Low-grade fever
• Night sweats
• Unexplained bruises
• Achy bones or joints
• Tiny red spots under the skin","In many cases, the cause of leukemia is not known. There are some factors that can increase your risk of developing one or more of the types. These include:

• Previous cancer treatment. Certain types of chemotherapy and radiation used for other cancer treatments can increase your risk.
• Some genetic disorders can increase your risk, such as Down syndrome.
• Certain chemicals. Excess exposure to some chemicals can increase your risk. One example is benzene, which is found in gasoline.
• Cigarette smoking increases the risk of one type of leukemia.
• Family history. Having a family member with leukemia raises your risk.","Your doctor will start by asking you detailed questions about your symptoms. Next, they will perform a physical exam to check for signs of leukemia, such as pale skin or swollen lymph nodes. After the exam, your doctor will likely order blood tests. These tests can detect abnormal levels in your blood that may suggest leukemia.

In addition to blood tests, your doctor may also recommend a bone marrow test. In this procedure, they remove a small sample of bone marrow and examine it under a microscope to look for leukemia cells.

If your doctor suspects leukemia, they will probably order further tests. These additional tests not only help confirm the diagnosis, but also identify the specific type of leukemia and determine how far it has spread in your body.","Most of the time, there’s nothing you can do to stop leukemia from happening. Some people have risk factors but never get it. Other people get leukemia even though they don’t have any risk factors. This means doctors don’t always know why someone gets leukemia.","There are several treatment options for leukemia. Your doctor may recommend more than one type of treatment. What is best for one person may not be the best treatment for you. Your doctor will make the decision based on several things, including:

• Your age
• Your general health
• The type of leukemia
• Where the cancer has spread

Common available treatments include:

Chemotherapy – Powerful medicines are used to kill cancer cells. They are given through an IV (directly into the vein) or in pill form. This is the primary treatment for leukemia. Chemotherapy can cause unpleasant side effects. These include weakness, exhaustion, and hair loss.

Radiation therapy – High-energy rays are used to kill cancer cells. You lie on a table while a large machine moves around you. It directs the radiation into your body. It is a painless procedure. Radiation can cause some side effects as well, including fatigue, skin problems, and a low blood count.

Targeted therapy – Special medicines block the growth and spread of specific cancer cells. They can be given in an IV or as a pill. Common side effects of targeted therapy include diarrhea and liver problems. Other side effects might include problems with blood clotting and wound healing, high blood pressure, fatigue, mouth sores, nail changes, the loss of hair color, and skin problems, such as rash or dry skin.

Stem cell transplant – This procedure removes your cancerous bone marrow and replaces it with healthy bone marrow. You may be able to use your own stem cells. You may need a donor. It is very similar to a bone marrow transplant. It normally follows chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Side effects can include mouth and throat pain, nausea and vomiting, and infection.","With proper treatment, leukemia can go into remission. However, how well you respond to treatment depends on several factors—including how early the cancer was diagnosed. On the other hand, if the cancer is left untreated or goes undetected, it can spread to other parts of the body. This could lead to serious health problems or even become life-threatening. That’s why it’s important to begin treatment as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, living with cancer during treatment can be physically and emotionally challenging. Different treatments can cause different side effects. To support your health during this time, take good care of yourself: eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to stay mildly active to maintain your energy.

In addition, living with leukemia can take a toll on your emotions. That’s why it’s important to seek support when you need it. Whether it’s family, friends, a counselor, or a support group, connecting with others can help you cope emotionally.

Even after the cancer is gone, it’s important to know that you’re at a higher risk of it returning. For this reason, you’ll need regular follow-up care and checkups for years after treatment to monitor your health and catch any changes early.","• What type of leukemia do I have?
• Will I need more tests?

244,Lichen Planus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/lichen-planus/,"Lichen planus is a type of rash that forms on your skin, on genitalia, or in your mouth. It is marked by purple bumps that are flat and uneven in size. The bumps may have white scales or flakes on them. Often, the rash is itchy.

Lichen planus commonly occurs on your wrists, ankles, and chest. You also can get it on your scalp, nails, genitals, or the inside of your mouth. On the scalp, lichen planus may cause hair loss. Lichen planus of the nails can cause brittle or split nails. In the mouth, the rash looks like lacy white patches on the cheeks or tongue. Lichen planus of the mouth, genitals, or anus can cause soreness and a burning sensation. Sometimes lichen planus affects areas of skin where you had a cut or burn.

Men and women can get lichen planus. It can affect people of any age but is more common in middle-aged adults.","The prime symptom of lichen planus is itching. It can be mild or severe. The rash may consist of a few bumps or large patches. These can last for weeks or months and can return once they’ve gone away. Sometimes, the bumps leave dark brown spots on the skin. This is more common in people who are Asian, Hispanic, and Black. The brown spots are not scars and fade over time.

Lichen planus inside the mouth can cause painful sores that make it hard to eat.","In most cases, the cause of lichen planus is unknown. Doctors think it could be caused by an allergic reaction or immune disease. The rash breaks out when your body’s immune system attacks the skin or mucous cells. Some cases may be linked to the hepatitis C virus. Some medications also can cause it.

Lichen planus is not contagious. You cannot catch it from or give it to someone else. It is not caused by stress, but sometimes stress makes it worse.","Contact your doctor if you have the symptoms listed above. They can tell if you have lichen planus by looking at your rash. The doctor may do a blood test or skin biopsy. These tests help rule out other issues. For biopsy, the doctor takes skin cells from one or more of the bumps. The cells are sent to a lab to confirm the diagnosis.",You cannot prevent lichen planus because the exact cause is unknown.,"There is no cure for lichen planus. Most of the time, the bumps caused by lichen planus go away without any treatment after about a year. However, treatment can help improve the rash and reduce symptoms.

• Antihistamines, such as Benadryl, to relieve itching
• Corticosteroids to relieve itching and swelling. These come in pill, shot, gel, and cream forms.
• Mouthwashes with lidocaine to relieve pain from mouth sores
• Light therapy

Lichen planus of the scalp must be treated right away or the hair may not grow back.","Treatment can help symptoms of lichen planus but does not cure it. Once the rash goes away, there is a chance it can come back. If your doctor prescribes medicine, follow the instructions. Try to avoid itching the bumps too much. There is a risk you can break the skin and cause an infection.","• Do I have lichen planus?
• What is the likely cause of my condition?
• What is the best treatment for me?

245,Lichen Sclerosus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/lichen-sclerosus/,"Lichen sclerosus is a type of skin condition. It often affects your genital or anal areas, but you can get it on other parts of your body. It can cause a rash, itching, pain, and scarring. Lichen sclerosus is most common in women after menopause. However, men and children can get it too.","Some people who have lichen sclerosus do not have any symptoms. Others may have the following symptoms or signs:

• Smooth, shiny, white spots on the skin
• Skin that is thin, wrinkled, and weak, or easy to tear
• Skin that is red, bruised, scaly, or cracked
• Bleeding or blistering in the affected area
• Itching, pain, or discomfort in the affected area
• Painful urination
• Pain during sex
• Painful bowel movements and constipation if lichen sclerosus occurs in the anal area.","Doctors do not know the exact cause of lichen sclerosus. Possible causes are:

• An overactive immune system
• Hormone problems
• Injury to the affected area

A family history of the condition may increase your risk of getting it. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. You cannot catch it from or pass it to someone else.",Contact your doctor if you have symptoms of lichen sclerosus. Your doctor will perform a physical exam. They will want to know your health history and how long you have had the symptoms. Your doctor may do a skin biopsy. This involves taking a small sample of skin from the affected area to look at in the lab.,There is no way to avoid lichen sclerosus because the cause is unknown.,"Not all cases of lichen sclerosus can be cured. However, there are treatment options to manage or relieve symptoms. Your doctor will probably prescribe a strong cortisone cream. Apply this to the affected area according to the instructions. This can help relieve pain and itching but cannot repair scars.

Repeated use of cortisone cream often is effective. Continue to follow up with your doctor during this treatment. Cortisone cream can have side effects over time. These include thinning or redness of the skin, stretch marks, and genital yeast infections.

Medicines are available if you have an infection or are allergic to cortisone. Options include:

• Tacrolimus ointment
• Retinoids, such as isotretinoin or retinol. These are like vitamin A supplements
• Ultraviolet light treatments for skin not near the genital area

Over-the-counter antihistamine skin creams may help with the pain and itching. A sitz bath also can help with pain, itching, and scratching. This is where you sit in a few inches of warm water.

There are other things you can do to help relieve discomfort:

• Wear loose-fitting underwear during the day and none at night.
• Do not wear pantyhose, tights, and other tight clothing.
• Do not stay in swimsuits or wet clothing for long periods of time.
• Avoid vaginal sprays, which can cause irritation.
• Use a mild skin cleanser. Look for products designed for sensitive skin.
• Avoid scented detergent, fabric softeners, and dryer sheets.","Lichen sclerosus often can be managed with treatment. If left untreated, the conditions can have serious effects. Severe cases may cause severe pain during sex. You may be emotional about having a condition in your genital area.

Lichen sclerosus can be a risk factor for skin cancer and vulvar cancer. This is why it’s important to see your doctor if you have signs or symptoms.","• How bad is my case of lichen sclerosus?
• What treatment option is best for me?
• How long do I need to use cream or take medicine?

246,Lipomas,https://familydoctor.org/condition/lipomas/,"Lipomas are benign (not cancerous), slow-growing tumors that come from fat cells. They are usually round, moveable lumps under the skin. They feel soft and doughy or rubbery. Lipomas usually grow in the neck, shoulders, back, or arms. They are the most common noncancerous tumor in adults. Most lipomas do not hurt unless they are squeezed or bruised.","Often, a lipoma has been growing for years before it is noticeable. It is fairly common to have more than one lipoma. If you notice a lump or swelling anywhere on your body, you should have it checked by your family doctor. In some cases, a lump can be a sign of a more serious problem.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes lipomas to grow. They can occur at any age, but they often appear when you’re between 40 and 60 years of age. Sometimes they run in families. Sometimes they are caused by an injury. Lipomas are not caused by being overweight.",Tests are usually not needed to diagnose a lipoma. Your doctor can usually diagnose it just by looking at it and feeling the firmness of the lump. They may order an ultrasound to get an image of the growth to confirm the diagnosis.,There is no proven method for preventing lipomas from forming.,"Lipomas are almost always benign. They usually do not need treatment. If they are painful or are growing quickly, you may want to have treatment. Treatment options include steroid shots, liposuction, or surgery to remove the lipoma. This can even be done in your doctor’s office. Your doctor can help you decide what is right for you.","Once your doctor confirms that you have a lipoma, you can choose your next step. Does your lipoma interfere with your day-to-day activities? If not, you can just leave it alone. But if it makes you uncomfortable, you can have it surgically removed.","• Does having lipomas make me more likely to develop cancer?
• Is there anything I can do to prevent lipomas in the future?
• Will I need surgery to remove the lipoma?

247,Long COVID: Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/long-covid/,"Most people who get sick with COVID-19 will recover within a week or even a few days. But for some, the symptoms of the disease can linger for weeks, months, or sometimes longer. This is known as long COVID. Long COVID can also refer to any medical condition that is linked to a COVID-19 infection that lasts for more than 3 months after your symptoms first appear.","The symptoms of long COVID are similar to those of COVID-19 itself. They can also include additional symptoms. People with long COVID may have problems from different combinations of symptoms that may come and go over time.

The most common symptoms include:

• Tiredness or fatigue
• Fever
• Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
• Cough
• Chest pain
• Fast or pounding heart beats
• Difficulty thinking or concentrating
• Headaches
• Problems sleeping
• Dizziness when you stand
• Change in smell or taste
• Depression or anxiety
• Diarrhea
• Stomach pain

Other symptoms can include joint or muscle pain, a rash, or changes in menstrual cycles. Some symptoms may get worse after physical or mental effort.

Some people with long COVID may also have symptoms that don’t show up on tests and are hard to explain. If you think you have long COVID, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends you review these tips before visiting your doctor.","Doctors aren’t sure yet why some people get long COVID while others don’t. There are many potential factors, but no one cause has been determined. Some potential factors include:

• Blood clots that can prevent your lungs and other organs from working properly.
• Inflammation caused by an overreaction in your immune system.
• Autoimmune disorders. This happens when your immune system starts attacking other parts of your body.
• The continued presence of the COVID-19 virus in your body or other viruses that might be reactivated by it.","Your doctor will diagnose long COVID by listening to your symptoms and your health history. If you have already been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus, your doctor may order more tests to learn more about your symptoms and how to treat them.

This could include blood tests, chest x-rays or other imaging and lung function tests, which will tell your doctor how well your lungs are working.

Your doctor may also order other screenings including CT scans, which can measure how inflamed your lungs are; and electrocardiograms, which can help find issues with your heart.","While there is no 100% surefire way to prevent yourself from getting long COVID, you can take precautions that can dramatically lower your risk. Because you can’t get long COVID without getting COVID-19 first, the prevention steps for both are the same. They include:

• Regular handwashing with an antibacterial soap
• Avoiding others who may have been exposed to COVID-19
• Wearing a multilayer, snug-fitting mask in public places
• Getting the latest COVID-19 vaccination.

If you believe you have COVID-19, the first step is to get a test. You can test at home. If you cannot afford to purchase an at-home test at your local retail store, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will provide residential households in the U.S. with four, free at-home tests from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).

In general, testing availability may differ depending on where you live. There are some no-cost testing centers. Check your local health department to see what locations near you are doing testing and if there is a fee to test. This may include hospitals and pharmacies that offer drive-thru testing during high COVID-19 infection periods in your local community. This will allow you to stay in your car to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Depending on the location, someone may approach your car to collect a sample, or they may ask you to collect it yourself. Samples for COVID-19 viral tests are collected through nasal swabs. Depending on where you get your test, you may get your results the same day or you may have to wait a few days. Find out more about COVID-19 testing.

Where you live or work can increase your chances of getting COVID-19 and long COVID, as can your access to health care. If you have underlying health conditions or have not been vaccinated, you should seek treatment as soon as symptoms appear.

There is some evidence that taking antiviral medications within five days of a positive COVID test can reduce your risk of long COVID. Talk to your doctor if you have a positive test result.","Because it can include so many different symptoms, there is not just one treatment for long COVID. Your doctor may try a variety of approaches to find one that works best for you.

The most common treatments include:

• Medication. This will treat most of the major symptoms including coughs, headaches, nausea, and diarrhea. If your doctor finds an underlying cause for your long COVID symptoms, they may be able to prescribe medications specific to that cause.
• Stellate ganglion or olfactory retraining. Don’t let the big words scare you. This is just a fancy way of saying treatments that can help bring back your sense of smell and taste. A stellate ganglion block numbs nerves in your neck that can affect your sense of smell. Olfactory retraining uses smells to help your brain remember what things should smell like.
• Physical therapy. This can help you deal with pain or movement issues you might be experiencing. It can include exercise, massage, and other treatments.
• Pulmonary rehabilitation. This is a special kind of exercise program that can help you breathe better and learn how to manage your breathing issues at home.
• Counseling. This can help you deal with any mental issues you might be having connected with long COVID, such as depression or anxiety.","As the name implies, long COVID can mean that symptoms will occur for weeks, months and in some cases more than a year. You should see your doctor if you have symptoms that recur after your first COVID symptoms have gone away or if they disrupt your daily life.

While doctors are learning more every day about long COVID, there is still much that is unknown. Long COVID symptoms can also vary from person to person. It may take some trial and error to properly treat your symptoms.

If you had COVID-19 and were hospitalized or needed intensive care, your risk for having long COVID increases. There is also new evidence that repeated COVID-19 infections could increase the likelihood of developing long COVID. That is why it is important to get the vaccine. Even if you do get COVID-19, the vaccine will reduce your chances of getting severely ill.

248,Low Back Pain,https://familydoctor.org/condition/low-back-pain/,"Low back pain is a common problem for many people. Different things can cause it, including injuries and certain conditions. You can help prevent pain in your lower back by learning how to sit, stand, lift, and exercise correctly.","Low back pain varies by person. It may be a dull ache or a sharp, stabbing pain. It could be acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing). You may have pain in other parts of your body as well as your back.

• Your pain goes down your leg below your knee
• Your leg, foot, groin, or rectum feel numb
• You have fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, or weakness
• You have trouble going to the bathroom
• Your pain was caused by an injury
• Your pain is so intense that you can’t move around
• Your pain doesn’t improve or gets worse after 2 to 3 weeks","Injuries are a common cause of low back pain. Examples include a muscle strain or spasm, ligament sprain, joint problem, or a “slipped disk.” A slipped disk, or herniated disk, has to do with your spine. It occurs when a disk between the bones of your spine swells or bulges and presses on your nerves. Twisting while lifting often causes this. Many people who have a slipped disk do not know what caused it. Often, the exact cause of back pain may not be clear.

You may have pain in your lower back after doing an activity you aren’t used to, such as lifting heavy furniture or doing yard work. Sudden events, such as a fall or a car wreck, can cause back pain. You also may have pain from an injury to another part of your body.","Visit your doctor if you have pain in your lower back. They will review your symptoms and health history and do a physical exam. Based on this information, your doctor may perform tests. These include an X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Tests may help to diagnose the cause but more often can help rule out other causes.",There are several things you can do to prevent or avoid low back pain. These include learning correct posture and strengthening your muscles.,"Most people who have pain in their lower back can treat it on their own. Often the pain goes away in a few days or weeks. You may need 1 to 2 days of rest for a hurt back. However, too much rest can cause your muscles to weaken. This can slow your recovery. Even if it hurts, try to walk around for a few minutes each hour. This helps keep your back muscles strong.

There are a few positions that provide relief when your back hurts. These help to take the pressure and weight off your back. Lay on your back on the floor:

• With pillows under your knees
• With your hips and knees bent
• With your hips and knees bent and your feet on a chair

Heating pads can help to relax painful muscle spasms. Use heat for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Ice packs (use for less than 15 minutes every 30 minutes) and massages may give relief as well. Over-the-counter medicines can reduce pain and swelling. These include aspirin, acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol), naproxen (brand name: Aleve), and ibuprofen (brand names: Advil and Motrin).

People who have ongoing back problems need treatment to manage the cause. Being overweight can make back pain worse. If you are overweight, you may need to lose weight. You may need to exercise or improve your posture when you are sitting, standing, sleeping, or lifting.

Severe cases of lower back pain could require physical therapy or wearing a brace to support your back. Your doctor may prescribe pain relievers or injections for severe pain. These prescriptions can be addictive, so it’s best to seek other treatment methods, if available.","Work with your doctor to create a treatment plan for the pain in your lower back. It will depend on the cause of your pain and if it is acute or chronic. Once your pain has gone away, practice things to prevent future injury and pain.","• What is the cause of the pain in my lower back?

Keep your knees a little higher than your hips. Adjust the seat or use a low stool to prop up your feet. To turn in your chair, move your whole body rather than twist at your waist.

When driving, sit straight and move the seat forward. This helps you not have to lean to reach the controls. You may want to put a small pillow or rolled towel behind your lower back if you must drive or sit for a long time.

Maintain good posture while you stand. Keep your ears, shoulders, and hips in a straight line, with your head up and your stomach pulled in. Try not to slouch or arch your back. These put added pressure on your lower back. Wear shoes that are comfortable and provide support. If you stand for long periods, rest 1 foot on a low stool to relieve pressure on your lower back. Every 5 to 15 minutes, switch the foot you’re resting on the stool.

The best way to sleep is on your side with your knees bent. You may put a pillow under your head to support your neck. You also may put a pillow between your knees for added comfort. If you sleep on your back, put pillows under your knees and a small pillow under your lower back. Don’t sleep on your stomach unless you put a pillow under your hips.

Use a firm mattress. If your mattress is too soft, put a 1/2-inch plywood board under the mattress to add support.

Always stretch your back and body before you exercise. For a gentle stretch, lay on your back with your knees bent. Slowly raise your left knee to your chest and press your lower back into the floor. Hold for 5 seconds. Relax and repeat the exercise with your right knee. Do 10 of these exercises for each leg.

In addition to back exercises, it’s important to stay active in general. Swimming and walking are good exercises to improve your overall fitness."
249,Lumbar Spinal Canal Stenosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/lumbar-spinal-canal-stenosis/,"The lumbar spinal canal is the space inside the lower spine that carries nerves to your legs. It is very narrow. Over the course of many years, the bone and tissue around the canal grow, causing the canal to become even more narrow. This narrowing is called stenosis. As this happens, the nerves that go through it are squeezed. This squeezing may cause back pain, leg pain, weakness, and numbness.","People who have lumbar spinal canal stenosis may have back or leg pain or numbness. Your legs might also feel cramped, tired, or weak. These symptoms usually start when you are standing or walking.

Many people notice the pain is better climbing stairs or leaning over a shopping cart and worse walking down stairs. Often, the symptoms get better if you sit, crouch, or lie in the fetal position (with your knees tucked up to your chest). It’s thought that these positions open the lumbar canal and take the pressure off the nerves that go to the legs. In severe cases, stenosis can cause partial or complete bowel or bladder incontinence.","Lumbar spinal canal stenosis may happen on its own over time. This is because your bones and other tissues continue to grow around the canal. This growth makes the canal narrow over the course of your life. Other causes of lumbar spinal canal stenosis include:

• Arthritis
• Falls
• Accidents
• Wear and tear on the spine’s bones and joints",Sometimes your doctor can tell if you have stenosis by asking you about your symptoms. Doctors may also order special tests and X-rays of the spine to make the diagnosis.,"Lumbar spinal canal stenosis cannot really be prevented because it seems to be a part of getting older. Doctors don’t know why certain people develop it. But you may be able to reduce your risk by exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and using good posture.","Your treatment will depend on how bad your symptoms are. If your pain is mild and you haven’t had it long, you can try an exercise program or a physical therapy program. This can strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture.

Your doctor may also prescribe medicine to help reduce inflammation (soreness and swelling) in your spine. If you have more severe symptoms, you may need to see a spine surgeon. The surgeon may recommend an operation to take the pressure off the nerves in your lower spine. This surgery works well for many people.","Lumbar spinal canal stenosis symptoms may come and go, especially at first. If you’ve noticed discomfort in your back and legs, talk to your doctor. These early symptoms are often easily managed through exercise.

The longer you have lumbar spinal canal stenosis, the more likely you’ll have symptoms that are more noticeable. You may be able to manage the symptoms by taking medicine or you may need only a heating pad. Work with your doctor to decide which strategy is best for you.","• My father had lumbar spinal canal stenosis. Am I at risk of having it?

A ruptured or herniated disk usually pinches 1 or 2 nerves at a time. The pain caused by a ruptured disk in the lumbar spine is easy to diagnose and is known as sciatica. Sciatica causes back pain that shoots down one leg along the path of the sciatic nerve. It can happen any time, not just when you stand up or start walking like it does with stenosis."
250,Lung Cancer | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/lung-cancer/,"Lung cancer is abnormal growth of cells in the lungs. It is one of the most common forms of cancer in the world. More people in the United States die from lung cancer than any other cancer. Most cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking.

There are 2 types of lung cancer: Non-small cell – This is the most common form of lung cancer. More than 85% of people with lung cancer have non-small cell. Small cell – The cells of this form of cancer are small. The cells grow and spread faster than in non-small cell lung cancer. It is treated differently.","Symptoms of lung cancer can differ from person to person. Common symptoms include:

• A cough that gets worse or won’t go away
• Chest pain
• Shortness of breath or wheezing
• Ongoing problems with pneumoniaor bronchitis
• Coughing up blood
• Feeling tired all the time
• Unexplained weight loss

Some people report just not feeling well. If the cancer has spread, you might feel pain or have problems with the part of the body it has spread to. Many people with lung cancer don’t experience symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage. That is one of the reasons more people die from it.

With treatment, you may put your lung cancer into remission. Your outcome after treatment depends on many factors, including how early your doctor diagnosed the cancer. If you don’t treat or detect lung cancer early, it can spread to other parts of your body—such as your lymph nodes or organs. In many cases, people don’t receive a diagnosis until the cancer has already spread. This can lead to serious health problems or even death. That’s why it’s very important to start treatment as soon as possible.

Living with cancer during treatment can feel overwhelming. Different treatments may affect your body in different ways. Focus on taking care of yourself—eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and try to stay gently active to keep your energy up. Lung cancer can also affect your emotional health. Don’t hesitate to reach out for support. Your family, friends, counselors, or a support group can help you cope emotionally.

Even after treatment, your risk of cancer coming back remains higher. To stay on top of your health, make sure you attend regular follow-up visits and checkups for years to come.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","There are several known causes of lung cancer. Smoking In most cases (80% to 90%), smoking causes lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals. Many of these are known to cause cancer. Smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers. People who use other tobacco products are also at increased risk of getting lung cancer. These products include cigars, pipes, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or vape).

Your risk of getting lung cancer is higher the earlier you started smoking, and the more cigarettes you smoked per day. If you used to smoke but don’t anymore, your risk of lung cancer decreases. But it is still higher than if you never smoked at all. Secondhand smoke Secondhand smoke is the smoke that other people make when they are smoking tobacco products. When you breathe it in, you are still getting the harmful effects from the smoke. Thousands of people who never smoked die every year from lung cancer because they’ve been around secondhand smoke.

Radon Radon is a gas that occurs naturally in the earth. It gets trapped in houses and buildings. There, it can reach high levels that can cause cancer. Exposure to radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. Other substances A variety of other substances have been linked to lung cancer. These include asbestos, arsenic, diesel exhaust, and certain forms of silica and chromium.","Lung cancer is often found on an X-ray or CT scan being done for another reason. If you have symptoms of lung cancer, your doctor will do a physical exam. He or she will listen to your chest. If they hear fluid around your lungs, they may suspect lung cancer. They will ask you about your medical history, and if you smoke. They will also ask if you’ve been exposed to other things that can cause cancer, such as asbestos.

Your doctor will probably order tests that can look for lung cancer. Some of these tests may include:

• chest X-ray
• CT scan
• PET (positron emission tomography) scan
• Sputum test
• Thoracentesis (samples fluid that has built up around the lungs)

If any of these tests indicate cancer may be present, your doctor will probably order a biopsy. They will remove a piece of tissue from your lung. They will look at the tissue under a microscope and look for cancer cells.

If cancer cells are found in a biopsy, your doctor will do more testing. This will help them find out how quickly the cancer may grow, how likely it will or has spread, and how certain treatments might work.","In most cases, lung cancer can be prevented.

• Don’t smoke. If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you do smoke, try to quit. If you vape, quit. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor. There are many methods available to help you. These include the nicotine patch, gum, and medicine.
• Avoid secondhand smoke. If you spend time with people who smoke, ask them to not smoke around you. Avoid places where there will be secondhand smoke.
• Have your home tested for radon. This is recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency. If your homes tests for high levels of radon gas, you can install a radon mitigation system to vent the gas outside of your home.
• Avoid carcinogens. Carcinogens are things that cause cancer. Other common carcinogens (in addition to smoke, radon, and asbestos) that can cause lung cancer include diesel exhaust, coal dust, and other types of soot.

If you smoke and are between 55 and 80 years old, you can get a screening for lung cancer. This is done through a low-dose CT scan. Screening helps find cancer earlier or before it spreads. This improves your chances of successful treatment.","There are several treatment options for lung cancer. Your doctor may recommend more than one type of treatment. What is best for one person may not be the best treatment for you. Your doctor will make the decision based on several things, including:

• Your general health
• The type of lung cancer
• Where the cancer has spread

Common available treatments include:

• Surgery – A surgeon cuts out the tumor or any cancerous tissue.
• Radiation therapy – High-energy rays are used to kill cancer cells. It may be used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that are still there.
• Chemotherapy – Powerful medicines are used to kill cancer cells. They are given through an IV (directly into the vein) or in pill form. Chemotherapy can cause unpleasant side effects. These include weakness, fatique, and hair loss.
• Targeted therapy – Special medicines block the growth and spread of specific cancer cells. They can be given in an IV or as a pill.

People with non-small cell lung cancer can be treated with any of these therapies, or a combination. People with small cell lung cancer are usually treated with radiation and chemotherapy. Other therapies are also available. Ask your doctor which is the right treatment for you.",null,"• What type of lung cancer do I have?

251,Lupus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/lupus/,"Lupus is a disease that affects your immune system. An immune system that is functioning well has antibodies that fight off viruses, bacteria, and other foreign substances. In people who have lupus, an autoimmune disease, their immune system becomes overactive and attacks healthy cells and tissue.

There are several kinds of lupus. Each type has its own","symptoms and affects your body in different ways.

• Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common and serious type of lupus. It affects multiple body systems, including blood vessels, joints, kidneys, skin, heart, lungs, and the brain and nerves. Symptoms of SLE can be mild or severe.
• Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is sometimes called discoid lupus erythematosus. This kind of lupus affects the skin, some people who have CLE may have SLE, too. The first symptom of CLE is often a red rash or scaly patch on the face or scalp. It is typically in the shape of a circle or disk. The rash may last a few days or several years. It can go away for a while and then come back. Sometimes CLE can cause sores in the mouth or nose.
• Drug-induced lupus is caused by a reaction to certain long-term prescription medicines. Symptoms are similar to those of SLE, including muscle and joint pain, a rash, and fever. Drug-induced lupus does not cause problems with the kidneys, heart, brain, or blood vessels. Symptoms are often mild, and usually go away after you stop taking the medicine. This kind of lupus is more common in men who take medicine for heart conditions.
• Neonatal lupus is a rare form of lupus that affects newborn babies. Babies who have neonatal lupus are born with a skin rash, and sometimes liver and heart problems. For most babies, the symptoms gradually go away over several months. In rare cases, neonatal lupus can cause a serious heart problem. Doctors think that neonatal lupus might be caused in part by certain proteins in the mother’s blood that are passed on to the baby at birth. If you are pregnant and have SLE, your doctor will want to monitor you and your baby for certain complications. Most babies born to mothers who have SLE are healthy.

Lupus can affect many parts of the body, including your joints, skin, and organs. It depends on the kind of lupus you have. Symptoms can develop quickly or slowly. They also can come and go and be mild or severe.

Not everyone who has lupus has the same symptoms. Common symptoms of lupus may include:

• Fever.
• Constant fatigue.
• Sensitivity to the sun or light.
• Joint pain or swelling.
• Muscle pain.
• Chest pain with deep breathing.
• Trouble thinking, and/or memory problems.
• Kidney problems.

Many people also have symptoms that affect their skin and hair, such as:

• Red rashes, often on the face and in the shape of a butterfly (called a malar rash)
• Mouth ulcers.
• Hair loss (alopecia).

Lupus may also cause symptoms that affect the blood and blood vessels:

• Low blood count.
• Blood clots.
• Pale or blue fingers or toes from cold or stress (Raynaud’s Disease).

• Swollen glands.
• Seizures.
• Weight loss or weight gain.
• Dry eyes.
• Severe headaches.
• Dizziness.
• Stroke.
• Depression.
• Hallucinations.
• Repeated miscarriages or other infertility problems.

Children can have the same symptoms of lupus as adults. The most common symptoms in children are:

• A red, butterfly-shaped rash (malar rash) over the bridge of the nose and the cheeks.
• Low red blood cell count (anemia).
• Low white blood cell count (leukocytopenia).
• Severe brain or kidney problems.

It is common for lupus symptoms to come and go. Often, they may disappear for a period of time called remission. You may get new symptoms all of a sudden. When symptoms appear or get worse, it’s called a “flare.” You may have swollen joints and muscle pain one week and then no symptoms at all the next week.","The cause of lupus is unknown. Lupus can affect anyone, but it is most common in women between the ages of 15 and 44. African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women are more likely to have lupus than people of other races.","Lupus is a disease that is known for being difficult to diagnose. The symptoms are different from person to person. Sometimes, the symptoms may mimic those of another disease. Often, lupus symptoms come and go. It can sometimes take several years to receive an official diagnosis.

Getting an early, accurate lupus diagnosis can reduce its long-term effects.

There is not just one test doctors can use to tell if you have lupus. Doctors must consider many different sources of information. Your doctor will look at:

• Your symptoms.
• Your medical history.
• Results from lab tests .

Your doctor may also order blood and urine tests, such as:

• Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. This test checks for antibodies to the nucleus of your cells. A positive result means that your immune system may be attacking healthy cells. This does not always mean that you have lupus. Your doctor may recommend you see a specialist for more testing.
• Complete blood count. Lupus often affects a person’s red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet count. This test checks for anemia or the presence of certain proteins in your blood.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) tests. Results from these tests will show if there is inflammation (swelling) in your body.
• Urinalysis. Extra protein in the urine may show up in a lab test if lupus affects your kidneys.

Blood tests can also show how well your kidneys and liver are working, and if these organs have been affected by lupus. Your doctor may recommend a chest x-ray because lupus can sometimes cause swelling in the lungs and heart. An electrocardiogram test (ECG) checks for an abnormal heartbeat or damage to the heart that may be caused by lupus.

Depending on your symptoms and test results, your doctor also may order a skin or kidney biopsy.","You cannot avoid lupus since the cause of it is unknown. However, you may be able to help prevent flares. Common triggers include:

• Lack of rest.
• Stress.
• Sun exposure.
• Exposure to fluorescent or halogen light.
• Certain medicines.
• Infections.
• Injuries.

If you take medicines to help manage lupus, do not stop taking them without your doctor’s approval. This can cause flares as well.

Knowing the things that cause flares can help you better cope with your symptoms.","There is no cure for lupus, but treatments have improved in recent years. Treatment options vary depending on the kind of lupus you have, as well as your symptoms and the severity. Your treatment approach may change depending on if your symptoms are active or in remission.

If you have joint pain, sore muscles, or skin problems, such as a rash, your doctor may recommend that you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Medicine that is used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine, can be helpful in treating lupus symptoms and preventing flares. Some people have side effects from this kind of medicine, including problems with vision and muscle strength. Corticosteroids are another type of medicine that your doctor may prescribe. They can help reduce swelling, but often have worse side effects.

You will likely need stronger medicines if lupus has caused problems in your vital organs or the central nervous system (heart, brain, and blood vessels). Stronger drugs have the potential for more severe side effects, and your doctor will want to closely monitor you. High-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, can be given by mouth or through a vein in your arm. Another option is medicine that suppresses the immune system, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine. Both types of medicine can help control dangerous symptoms quickly and prevent permanent damage. Sometimes, these medicines are used together at a lower dosage to lessen the risk of side effects.

Your doctor may want you to stop taking certain drugs if your lupus symptoms go away for a time (in remission). This is because medicines used to treat lupus carry a high risk of side effects. However, even if you don’t have active symptoms, your lupus can return and cause future problems. These may include kidney disease and kidney failure, or atherosclerosis (build-up in the arteries), which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. It is important to see your doctor regularly for check-ups and maintain good health.

The following lifestyle changes may help relieve symptoms and/or prevent flares.

• Get plenty of rest. Fatigue is a common symptom of lupus, so try to maintain good sleep habits. Get enough hours of sleep at night and nap during the day, if needed.
• Get regular exercise.You might not always feel like it, but exercise is good for you. It will help you sleep better, as well as improve your mood and heart health. Try to avoid outside activities when you have a flare. Exposure to the sun can make your symptoms worse.
• Protect yourself from the sun. Wear clothing that covers as much of your skin as possible. Always use sunscreen, even if you are only outside for a short time. Don’t use tanning beds, and avoid fluorescent and halogen lighting. All of these are sources of ultraviolet light, which is known to trigger lupus symptoms.
• Quit or avoid smoking. Lupus can affect your heart and blood vessels. If you smoke, you are at a much higher risk for cardiovascular disease.
• Eat a healthy diet. Avoid any food that seems to make your symptoms worse. You may need to make changes to your diet if lupus causes high blood pressure or stomach or kidney problems. Try to eat a balanced and nutritious diet, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
• Take your medicine according to your doctor’s orders. Ask your doctor to explain the benefits and risks of your medicines. Depending on your symptoms and flares, you may need to make adjustments to the type of medicine you take, when you take it, and the dosage. Be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions.
• Pay attention to your mental health. Tuning into your emotional well-being will help you cope with your condition and give you a sense of control. Living with lupus can mean learning to manage a number of physical, mental, and social problems.
• Develop a support network. Get help from your family, friends, doctor, community, counselors, and support groups. This network can help you manage your condition.
• Be mindful of your symptoms, especially pain and fatigue. You should try to keep realistic expectations about what you can and cannot do. Make sure you communicate these needs to those around you.","When you are first diagnosed with lupus, you may have conflicting feelings. You may be relieved to finally know what is causing your symptoms. You may also have feelings of sadness, fear, confusion, and anger. Some people who have lupus have bouts of depression because of the challenges of living with this disease. Learning all you can about your illness can help you better cope with your symptoms, prevent flares, and deal with side effects and complications.

Lupus can affect and damage different parts of your body.

Your kidneys get rid of waste and other toxins from the body. Lupus can affect the kidneys and cause the structures that filter the blood to swell. Without treatment, lupus can lead to permanent kidney damage. If lupus affects your kidneys, you will probably need medicine to prevent serious damage. The most common symptom of kidney problems is swelling in your feet, legs, hands, or eyelids.

Lupus can inflame the sac around your heart and cause chest pain. Though less common, but more serious, it can harden the walls of your coronary arteries. This can lead to angina (chest pain) and an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Lupus can also cause inflammation of the heart itself, which can lead to scarring and possible heart failure.

Inflammation can also occur in the lining of your lungs. This can cause chest pain, which is often felt with deep breathing. People who have lupus are at risk of getting pneumonia.

Most people who have lupus have swollen and painful joints. These symptoms can come and go and may affect several joints at once. Usually, there is no long-term damage.

People who have lupus often get a butterfly-shaped, red rash across their nose and cheeks. This is called a malar rash. Other parts of the skin may be affected. You could have raised bumps or dry patches, often on areas that are exposed to the sun. You could get sores inside your mouth or nose. Hair loss (alopecia) is common during flares. You may notice a blotchy purple color on your hands, fingers, or toes. This happens when blood does not flow well to the skin’s surface. It is called Raynaud’s Disease.

Lupus can affect your brain and the nerves in your spinal cord. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, mild confusion or memory problems, vision problems, and changes in your mood. It can lead to more serious health issues, such as seizures or a stroke.

Lupus can cause the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets to decrease. Fewer red blood cells can lead to anemia, which is common in people who have lupus. White blood cells help the body fight infection. Rarely, do white blood cells get low enough to cause infection. Platelets help your blood to clot. A low platelet count can lead to easy bruising, nosebleeds, and other bleeding. It can also cause your blood to clot too easily or in unneeded places. If the blood clot breaks away and travels through the bloodstream, it can block blood vessels and cause serious problems, such as a stroke, blood clots in the lungs (thrombosis), or repeated miscarriages.","• How do I know if I have lupus?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Others won’t be able to see most of the symptoms caused by your lupus. When symptoms like pain, fatigue, depression, or joint stiffness make your regular tasks more difficult, it’s important to know how to talk to those around you.

It may help to start by explaining what lupus is not. Let people know that is not contagious, nor is it like cancer or HIV or AIDS. Then explain what lupus is. Let them know that it is chronic, which means you will have it forever, and that it affects each person differently.

Your conversations with others about lupus may change depending on who you are talking to.

• Tell your family and friends. Tell your loved ones about your symptoms and treatment. Make sure they understand that you will be okay, but that sometimes you may say “no” to things. They can help you to manage your schedule. They can also pitch in when you need help with things, like childcare or household tasks.
• Tell your job. If you feel it is okay to do so, you may want to work with your employer to make your workplace more comfortable for you. This might mean getting a better desk chair or requesting a flexible work schedule. If your employer won’t work with you, you may want to find a job that’s more manageable with your lupus. Remember, health problems like lupus are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
• Tell your school. You will want to register with your school’s accessibility office and learn about financial assistance opportunities. Talk to your professors, advisors, and maybe even your roommates about your lupus and what will you do if it causes you to miss something. Make sure not to overload your course schedule.

If you don’t feel that you have anyone you can talk to about your lupus, or if you’d like more resources, it may be helpful to seek out a therapist or an online support group.

It may take time to find the right combination of treatment options for your lupus. Work with your doctor to take an active role in managing your lupus. You can do this by:

• Tracking your symptoms. Use a journal to track what your symptoms are and when they are worst. If you are taking medications, track any side effects you may notice.
• Take the medications your doctor prescribes. If you experience side effects from a medicine, don’t just stop taking it. Talk to your doctor first.
• Communicate regularly with your doctor. Managing your lupus will require a team approach. Keep your doctor updated on how you’re feeling. Make sure you express any questions or concerns. It can be helpful to bring your journal with you to doctor appointments so that you remember everything you want to talk about.

Talking with your doctor about all of your symptoms and getting the right lab tests are important steps to arriving at an accurate diagnosis.

If you aren’t sure where to begin, the Lupus Foundation of America can help you to find the resources and support you need. These resources include:

252,"Lyme Disease: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment",https://familydoctor.org/condition/lyme-disease/,"Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is caused by a tick bite. It was first recognized in 1975 when large numbers of children around the town of Lyme, Connecticut, were being diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Researchers investigated and found that tick bites were causing the illnesses.

Lyme disease is carried by black-legged ticks (sometimes called deer ticks). These ticks are typically about the size of a sesame seed. They live mostly in certain areas of the country:

• Northeast and mid-Atlantic (northeast Virginia to Maine)
• North central states (mostly Wisconsin and Minnesota)
• West Coast (mostly northern California)

However, Lyme disease also occurs in other parts of the United States. Although you’re more likely to get it in the regions mentioned above, nearly every state reported cases of Lyme disease in 2017. The disease also exists in Europe, Asia, and Australia.","• Fever
• Chills
• Headache
• Fatigue
• Joint and muscle aches
• Swollen lymph nodes

The rash is a telltale sign of Lyme disease. It usually starts at the site of the tick bite and expands gradually over a few days. It can reach up to 12 inches across or more. The center may fade, creating a “bull’s eye” or target appearance. The rash may feel warm to the touch.

Some people with Lyme disease do not get the bull’s-eye rash. They may have many red spots instead. Others don’t get a rash at all. Around 75% of people with Lyme disease get a rash.

If Lyme disease isn’t treated, it can spread to other parts of the body. Late-stage symptoms include:

• Headaches
• Neck stiffness
• Arthritis (painful, swollen joints)
• Additional rashes
• Facial palsy (face muscles droop)
• Irregular or slow heartbeat
• Numbness in arms or legs
• Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord
• Changes in mood or sleep habits
• Short-term memory problems
• Nerve pain

It is normal to have a small bump or red spot where a tick bit you. This does not mean you have Lyme disease. It usually goes away in a day or two.","People get Lyme disease when they are bitten by an infected tick. Ticks live in areas with a lot of plant life, such as wooded areas or fields. They sit near the top of grassy plants and low bushes. They wait there for people or animals to brush up against them. Ticks can crawl on your clothes or body for up to several hours or more before attaching to the skin.

Ticks can attach to any part of your body. They usually hide in hard-to-see areas like the armpits, groin, or scalp. An infected tick must stay attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours to pass the bacteria to you.

People who spend time in outdoor areas where ticks are common are at higher risk of getting tick-borne diseases.","It can be difficult to diagnose Lyme disease. The ticks that carry it are very small and the bites don’t hurt. Many patients don’t remember being bitten. In addition, most of the symptoms are common with other illnesses.

If you find a tick in your skin, use tweezers to remove it immediately. Then wait a few days to see if you develop any symptoms. If you do, call your family doctor. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. They will look at the bite and check for a rash. They may order a blood test. But those aren’t always necessary to make the diagnosis. They can often give false results, especially in early-stage Lyme disease.

People who have joint swelling or nervous system problems may need to have special tests. Your doctor may need to take some fluid from the swollen joint or the spine to check for clues to your condition.

If you have been sick for 4 weeks or more, call your doctor. They can give you a blood test at this stage. It will tell you if you have Lyme disease.","The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid being bitten by ticks. When you are outdoors, follow these guidelines:

• Avoid areas that are wooded, brushy, or have tall grass.
• Walk in the center of trails.
• Use an insect repellent with at least 20% DEET. It can be put on clothing or sparingly on the skin. Don’t apply it to the face or hands of children.
• Treat clothing, tents, or other gear with repellents containing 0.5% permethrin.
• Wear light-colored clothing. This makes it easier to see and remove ticks from your clothes.
• Wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Tuck your pant legs into your socks or boots for added protection.

After you get home, check everything and everyone for ticks.

• Bathe or shower as soon as you can to wash off any ticks that have not attached to you.
• Check your entire body for ticks. Use a mirror for places you can’t see. Check your children and your pets. Common tick locations include the back of the knees, groin area, underarms, ears, scalp, and the back of the neck.
• Check any gear you used, including coats, backpacks, or tents.

Tumble dry clothes or blankets on high heat in the dryer for 10 to 15 minutes. This should kill any ticks. If clothes are dirty, wash them in hot water and dry on high heat for 60 minutes.","Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics. In most cases, people bitten by a tick are given antibiotics only if they are sick or have a rash. If you are bitten by a tick but don’t get sick or get a rash, you don’t need antibiotics.

Early-stage Lyme disease responds very well to treatment. In most cases, taking an antibiotic for 2 to 4 weeks kills the bacteria and clears up the infection. Your doctor will tell you how long to take the antibiotic. It’s important to take all the medicine your doctor prescribes. This will prevent the spread of Lyme disease to your joints, nervous system, or heart. If you have problems with the medicine, do not quit taking it. Call your doctor and talk to them about your side effects.

Late-stage Lyme disease is also treated with antibiotics. It may be necessary to give the antibiotics intravenously (through an IV) at this stage. Medicine that reduces swelling and pain can ease arthritis associated with late-stage Lyme disease. If necessary, excess fluid can be drained from any affected joints.","Most people treated in the early stages of Lyme disease make a quick and complete recovery. Some may experience symptoms for a few weeks after treatment. If you were treated for Lyme disease but you still don’t feel well, call your family doctor. They can make sure there isn’t something else wrong. They can help you find ways to ease your symptoms. Some patients have found relief with treatments typically used for chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia.

Other things you can do to help manage Lyme disease include:

• Educate yourself. There is a lot of inaccurate information to be sorted through, especially on the internet. Ask your doctor if you have questions.
• Track your symptoms. Keep a diary of your sleep patterns, eating habits, exercise routines, and how you’re feeling. You or your doctor may be able to make connections between them.
• Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet. Exercise as regularly as you can. Get plenty of rest.
• Find support.It can be hard to not feel well and not know why. Some people may think your symptoms aren’t real. Talk to friends and family. If they can’t offer support, talk with a counselor who can help you.","• I found a tick embedded in my skin, but I can’t get it out. What should I do?

Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible. Pull up with steady, even pressure. Be careful not to squeeze or twist the tick body. Sometimes parts of the tick remain in the skin. You can leave them alone or carefully remove them the same way you would a splinter. Do not use heat (such as a lit match), petroleum jelly, or other methods to try to make the tick “back out” on its own. These methods are not effective.

Wash the area where the tick was attached thoroughly with soap and water. Keep an eye on the area for a few weeks and note any changes. Call your doctor if you develop a rash around the area where the tick was attached. Be sure to tell your doctor that you were bitten by a tick and when it happened."
253,Lymphedema,https://familydoctor.org/condition/lymphedema/,"Lymphedema is excess fluid inside your body. It causes swelling in your arms, legs, fingers, and toes. Lymphedema occurs when something blocks the flow of fluid away from your arm or leg, such as when lymph nodes (small glands) are removed. This happens during cancer surgery. Also, it can be caused by abnormal development of your lymph system (primary lymphedema). Or it can result from a disease or surgery (secondary lymphedema).","Lymphedema symptoms can include:

• Swelling in your arms and legs
• A feeling of heaviness and tightening of the skin around the affected area
• General discomfort
• Difficulty moving the affected arms or legs
• Itching or burning in your legs
• Difficulty sleeping
• Hair loss","Cancer and cancer treatment cause secondary lymphedema. It’s a common side effect of breast cancer surgery. That’s when doctors remove all or part of the breast(s) or lymph nodes under the arm. Also, it can occur in the legs after surgery for uterine, prostate, vulvar, or ovarian cancer, melanoma, or lymphoma. Removing lymph nodes from the groin, pelvis, or neck can cause lymphedema. The risk increases with the number of lymph nodes that are removed or damaged. Radiation treatments can cause lymphedema.

Other factors can raise the risk of this condition. This includes being overweight or having obesity, delayed healing of skin after surgery, a tumor that blocks blood vessels or lymph nodes in the underarm, chest, neck, pelvis, or abdomen (stomach), and lymph scar tissue under the collarbone.","Your doctor will examine the swelling, ask you questions about your health history, and consider other causes. These may include infection or blood clots. He or she may measure the swelling. Diagnosis might include a lymphoscintigraphy. This procedure uses a probe to scan the inside of your body. Before the procedure, you are injected with a small amount of a radioactive dye. The dye lights up the affected area. It is visible with the probe.

Your doctor may order imaging scans, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT (computed tomography) to show the inside of your body. These scans are similar to an X-ray. They can reveal possible sources of blockage to the flow of fluid. Doctors grade the affected area (1-4) to determine the seriousness of the lymphedema. Grading is based on the size and severity of the swelling.","There’s no guarantee you can prevent or avoid it. You can reduce your risks or delay onset. Take these precautions:

• Avoid injury to the affected area. If you had lymph nodes removed from your underarm, avoid lifting and carrying heavy items. Avoid infection through burns and cuts. If you have to have a blood test, have it done on the opposite arm. The same is true for blood pressure tests. Have the nurse put the blood pressure cuff on the opposite arm.
• Wear loose clothing. It doesn’t have to be baggy. Avoid overly tight jeans, pants, sleeves, etc.
• Rest and recover. After cancer treatment, give your affected arm or leg a rest. Follow your doctor’s advice. Don’t do heavy exercise or physical activity until your doctor approves. Elevate your arm or leg. This reduces swelling.
• Lose weight if you are overweight. Maintain a healthy weight.","There is no medicine to treat lymphedema. It is treated by a physical therapist (PT). Your therapist will give you special exercises you can do with your PT and at home. These exercises reduce swelling.

You may have to wear a compression garment on your affected arm or leg. This is different than wearing tight clothing. The garment looks like a sleeve. It applies the right amount of pressure to the swelling. You may have to wear the compression garment all of the time or in certain circumstances. Many breast cancer survivors, for example, have to wear a compression sleeve during air travel. Air travel tends to increase swelling.","Lymphedema does cause discomfort. Therefore, it’s important to plan ahead if you know you are having surgery that could cause lymphedema. Learn the preventive steps you can take to reduce your post-surgery risks or delay it. If you have lymphedema, your daily living will revolve around managing the discomfort. This includes exercise, weight loss, and avoiding injury. You may have to wear a compression sleeve.","• Can lymphedema be cured?
• If I was physically fit before my surgery, will that reduce my risk of lymphedema?
• Does a high sodium diet make lymphedema worse?
• Are there complications from uncontrolled lymphedema?","American Cancer Society, Lymphedema: What Every Woman with Breast Cancer Should Know

254,Mad Cow Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/mad-cow-disease/,Mad cow disease is the common name for a very rare and deadly brain disease. The scientific name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It’s spread by eating beef products from a cow that has been infected. Both animals and humans can get the disease. People get a version of BSE called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).,"In humans, it’s difficult to diagnose mad cow disease until it’s reached the most serious stages. It can begin with symptoms of depression and loss of coordination. Later, dementia symptoms appear. These can include serious declines in memory, thinking, and behavior.

Brain abnormalities can be seen through a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This test gives your doctor a picture of the inside of your brain. Abnormalities don’t show up on an MRI until near the end of the disease. The disease progresses quickly, and it leads to death around one year after symptoms appear.",Eating meat or bone meal from infected cattle causes mad cow disease. The beef is contaminated when it’s exposed to tissue from the infected cow’s brain and spinal cord.,"Doctors focus on eliminating other diseases and conditions that have similar symptoms. For example, a blood test can help rule out some other brain diseases that are similar to mad cow disease. An MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan can help rule out a stroke or brain tumor. Doctors can order a spinal fluid test to see if the protein present in mad cow disease is found in your spinal fluid. Unfortunately, since mad cow disease is so rare, many doctors don’t consider it until a person nears the end of their life.","Mad cow disease is extremely rare in the United States. Most cases have occurred in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom.

U.S. government agencies have taken many steps to keep food in the United States safe. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulate animal feed to keep cows safe from BSE. They also prevent high-risk cows and cow products from entering the country from other countries. These and other steps have worked very well to keep mad cow disease out of the United States.

If you live in the United States, you don’t need to do anything to avoid mad cow disease. If you are traveling to another country, the best way to reduce your risk is to avoid eating beef.

Mad cow disease isn’t contagious. It can’t be transmitted by being around someone who has the disease. So practices like good hygiene or handwashing don’t prevent it.",There is no cure for mad cow disease. Doctors focus on providing patients and their caregivers advice for support.,"Living with mad cow disease means learning to adapt to the changes and complications of brain deterioration. As the disease worsens, it takes away a person’s independence. They are no longer able to care for themselves. Caregivers will be given guidance on the best ways to care for their loved one at this stage.","• Does mad cow disease affect milk and milk products?
• Can diseased meat in restaurants contaminate vegetables and utensils in the same restaurant?
• Can safe cooking eliminate the disease?
• Can the disease be passed on through sexual contact?","U.S. Food & Drug Administration: All About BSE (Mad Cow Disease)

255,Malaria,https://familydoctor.org/condition/malaria/,"Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is carried by one type of mosquito in certain parts of the world (not in the United States). Humans get the disease when an infected mosquito bites them. People with malaria get very sick with flu-like symptoms. If left untreated, malaria can quickly become very serious. It can even be fatal.

Malaria is almost wiped out in the United States. But it’s common in developing countries with warm climates. These areas include:

• Central and South America
• Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic)
• Africa
• Eastern Europe
• Southeast Asia
• South Pacific

People who travel to these countries could get sick. If you’re traveling to an area where malaria is common, you should be aware of the risk and take precautions. Check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for information about travel health concerns for international locations before you go.","There are 4 types of malaria parasites that can infect people. The symptoms of each kind are generally the same. One kind tends to cause more severe symptoms and is more likely to lead to death than other kinds. Common symptoms of malaria include:

• high fever (can often be 104° F and higher)
• chills
• shaking
• extreme sweating
• fatigue
• discomfort (called malaise) and body aches
• headache
• nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
• anemia
• jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)

Most people experience symptoms 10 days to 4 weeks after an infection. It’s possible to not have symptoms for up to 1 year after you’re infected. Two types of malaria can occur again. The parasites can go dormant in the liver for several months up to 4 years after infection. When they become active again, the person gets sick again.","Malaria is caused by a parasite that is carried by mosquitos. If a mosquito carrying this parasite bites you, the parasite can get into your blood. The parasite lays eggs, which develop into more parasites. They feed on your red blood cells until you get very sick.

Because the parasites live in the blood, malaria can also be spread through other ways. These include blood transfusions, organ transplants, shared use of contaminated needles, and from mother to fetus. It’s not a contagious disease, so it can’t be spread from person to person like a cold or other illness.","Your doctor will ask you where you traveled. He or she will also do a blood test that can confirm if you have malaria. If you suspect you have malaria, tell your doctor right away.","There are steps you can take to avoid getting malaria. To protect yourself from getting it, you should do whatever you can to keep from getting mosquito bites.

• Sleep in a room with screens on the windows and doors.
• Use a mosquito net over your bed.
• Spray the net with permethrin, a spray that repels mosquitoes. Wear light-colored pants and shirts with long sleeves.
• Protect yourself with a bug repellent spray that contains no more than 35% of a chemical called DEET.
• Avoid going outdoors without protection in the evening, when mosquitoes are typically more active.

If you plan to travel to a country where malaria is common, you’ll probably take a medicine that may keep you from getting the disease. This is called “prophylactic” malaria medicine. (Prophylactic means it’s used to prevent disease.) But remember that no medicine can protect you 100%. You should still take other precautions to prevent being bitten by mosquitos.

See your doctor well before your trip. You will need to start taking the medicine a few days or weeks before you leave the country. You take the medicine during your trip and for 1 to 4 weeks after. How long you take it after your trip depends on which medicine you’re taking. It’s important to keep taking the medicine after your trip. The malaria parasites could still be in your blood. If you stop taking the medicine too soon, it could give the parasites a chance to grow and make you sick.

Malaria medicines have some side effects, and not everyone can take them. Your doctor can tell you which medicine is right for you. What type of medicine you take also depends on where you’ll be traveling.

Beware of homeopathic medicines advertised to prevent malaria. These medicines aren’t regulated by the government. So it’s hard to know whether they will be effective. The CDC warns against purchasing prophylactic malaria medicines overseas. In some countries, medicines sold to help prevent malaria may be fake or less effective than necessary.

If you’re pregnant, the CDC advises that you not travel to areas where you could get malaria. Symptoms of malaria are more severe in pregnant women. It can also cause problems with the pregnancy. These include miscarriage, preterm birth, or stillbirth. If you must travel to one of these places, you need to take the preventive medicine.","Malaria can be cured with prescription medicines. What kind of medicine you take and how long you take it depend on several factors, including:

• The type of malaria you have.
• Where you were infected.
• Your age.
• If you’re pregnant.
• How sick you are when you start treatment.

The disease can become serious quickly. Treatment should start as early as possible.","If you’re treated for malaria with the right medicines, you should be cured. All of the parasite will be destroyed. But if the disease is left untreated or isn’t treated correctly, it could continue. People who get one of the types that can go dormant in the liver sometimes need more than one medicine. This helps prevent a relapse months or years after infection. Another type of malaria can stay in the blood for decades if it’s left untreated. That’s why proper treatment for the specific type of malaria is so important.","• What should I do before I travel to lower my risk of getting malaria?
• How soon before I travel should I make an appointment to see you?
• Are there any medicines I should take before I travel?
• What areas of the world have the highest incidence of malaria?
• What can I do while in one of these areas to help prevent getting malaria?
• Should I wait until I get to a country to buy medicines to prevent malaria?
• Can I give someone else malaria?
• If I get malaria, should I travel while I have symptoms?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Parasites–Malaria

256,Male Breast Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/male-breast-cancer/,"Breast cancer is a form of cancer that occurs in your breast(s). Men can get breast cancer, but it is more common in women. Because of this, men often don’t know they have breast cancer until it is advanced.

There are several types and levels of male breast cancer. Types vary based on the location of cancer cells and what they look like. Breast cancer can begin in your lining, ducts, or lobules. It also can occur in your nipple or areola (the circular area around your nipple). This is known as Paget’s disease of the nipple.

Breast cancer can be invasive. This means it has or could spread within the breast and nearby tissue. Metastatic spread means that the cancer can also travel through your lymphatic system to other tissue, organs, or bones. If your cancer hasn’t spread, it is pre-invasive or “in situ.” Sometimes it is called non-invasive, but this can change if the cancer isn’t treated.

Cancer grades and stages depend on the cancer cells’ size, makeup, and features. The higher the grade is (1–3), the more abnormal the cells are. It also indicates how slow or fast your cancer cells grow. The higher the stage is (I–IV) the more advanced your cancer is. It also indicates the chance that your cancer will spread. Your grade and stage affect your treatment and outlook.

Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of male breast cancer. This starts in your breast ducts but is likely to spread to other areas.","Men should be aware of the shape, size, and feel of their breasts. This can help you detect signs of breast cancer early. Symptoms include:

• A lump, or mass, in your breast tissue (This can feel round, like a marble, or flat, like a button. The lump could be sore or painless.)
• Changes in the shape or size of your breast
• A dimple in the skin of your breast
• An inverted nipple
• Pain in your nipple, breast, or surrounding area, such as lymph nodes under your arm
• Red, rough, or itchy skin on your nipple or areola
• Nipple discharge

If you have breast cancer that has spread to your lymph nodes, you could find other lumps. These could be on the side of your breast, under your arm, or by your collarbone.","All people have cells in their bodies that body grow and divide. Cancer happens when some of those cells change and grow out of control. These abnormal cells can form a mass, or tumor. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

Boys and girls have similar amounts of breast tissue when young. At puberty, girls produce increased amounts of estrogen. This female hormone causes breast tissue to grow. At the same time, boys’ estrogen levels decrease, so little breast tissue grows.

Men often find they have breast cancer at a late stage. That’s because men have less breast tissue than women, and because many men aren’t aware of male breast cancer. Most, but not all, cases of male breast cancer include higher than normal estrogen levels.","Early detection and treatment will lead to better outcomes. See your doctor right away if you find a lump or notice symptoms.

Your doctor will perform a physical exam and review your history. If your doctor thinks you may have breast cancer, he or she may order more tests.

• A diagnostic mammogram takes an X-ray of your breasts. Each breast is placed between two plates and flattened to see the tissue. Mammograms can be awkward and you may be sore for a moment. Your doctor will review the X-ray for anything abnormal.
• An ultrasound gets a picture of your breast(s) using sound waves. The test is performed by moving a wand over the surface of your breast. The wand is attached to a machine that will create pictures of your breast(s). Your doctor will look at the picture for anything abnormal.
• A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test gets a picture of your breast(s) using magnetic energy and radio waves. For the test, you lay on a table and a large machine surrounds you. The test is painless but can take about an hour. Your doctor will look for anything abnormal on the picture.

If your doctor sees anything unusual on the tests, he or she will likely say you need a biopsy. During a biopsy, your doctor will remove a sample of the tissue. In some cases, they might need to remove the entire mass or lump. A biopsy is the only way to know if a mass is cancer or not. Biopsies determine the size, type, and grade of the cancer.

Cancerous cells also will be tested for certain hormones and genes. If your cells are receptive to estrogen and/or progesterone, you are hormone positive. This accounts for most cases of male breast cancer. Positive hormone receptors can suggest better outcomes. If your cells contain high levels of HER2, you are HER2-positive. This form of cancer cells tends to be more aggressive.

Breast cancer can spread (metastasize) by way of your lymphatic system. If your cancer is invasive, you might need more testing.","Men cannot prevent or avoid breast cancer. The American Academy of Family Physicians does not recommend breast cancer screening for men. However, men should talk to their doctor if they are at high risk for breast cancer. Their doctor might suggest genetic testing or a mammogram.

Factors that can increase the risk of male breast cancer include:

• Age. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average age of men diagnosed with breast cancer is between 60 and 70 years old.
• A family history of breast cancer and/or mutations of the BRCA gene.
• High levels of estrogen. This could be a result of genes, certain medicines, or hormone treatments. Men who are overweight or alcoholic also might have more estrogen.
• Radiation exposure to the chest area.
• Gynecomastia. This is a benign condition in which a man’s breasts are larger than normal. In turn, they have more breast tissue and are at risk of breast cancer.
• Klinefelter syndrome. Men who have this genetic disorder have two or more X chromosomes, along with a Y chromosome. (Normally, men only have one X and one Y chromosome.) Klinefelter syndrome is a birth defect. Men who have it can have enlarged breasts, as well as other traits.","All factors of male breast cancer play a role in your treatment. This includes size, location, type, grade, and stage. The size of the mass doesn’t change the outlook, but it can affect treatment options. Other aspects include your age, general health, and personal lifestyle choices. Talk to your doctor in detail about the risks and side effects of each treatment.

Treatment can include one or more of the following:

• Surgery: A mastectomy is the most common surgery for male breast cancer. It removes all or part of the breast tissue, nipple, areola, and surrounding lymph nodes. Surgery occurs in the hospital (inpatient) and requires anesthesia.
• Radiation therapy: Radiation is often used after surgery. It can destroy remaining cancer cells and help prevent it from spreading. It also can reduce the risk of cancer returning. Radiation is usually done as an outpatient at a hospital or treatment facility.
• Chemotherapy: This treatment form is powerful and affects your whole body. The medicine is meant to kill all fast-growing cells, which include cancer cells—and normal cells. Hair is fast growing and that’s why people who receive chemotherapy often lose their hair. You can get chemotherapy in pill or intravenous (IV) form, or both. Your doctor may prescribe other medicines to treat side effects.
• Hormonal therapy: This is an option if your cancer cells test positive for estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. It can help prevent cancer cells from growing and spreading.
• Targeted therapy: Certain forms of chemotherapy target cell defects. Herceptin medicine is a type that treats HER2-positive cancer cells. It marks and kills just the cancer cells and not normal cells. It helps prevent cancer cells from growing and spreading. Targeted therapy often has fewer side effects.","The process to diagnose and treat cancer can be long and frustrating. Most treatments are invasive and cause side effects. Medicines help counter these, but effects can be long lasting. You likely will need to make changes to your lifestyle.

After treatment, your cancer may subside. Remission can be brief or permanent. Cancer survivors usually require ongoing care. This can include testing and treatment to monitor and manage their health.

Living with cancer is emotional. You might consider joining a support group. Your doctor also might suggest rehabilitation to help with physical and life changes.

Having a male family member with breast cancer is a trigger for genetic testing and counseling. After receiving your diagnosis, a genetic counselor can help you determine if members of your family should be tested for mutations in the BRCA gene. Abnormalities in the BRCA gene cause forms of breast and ovarian cancer.","• What treatments do I need?
• How will cancer treatment affect my daily life?
• Should I participate in clinical trials?
• What is the outlook of my breast cancer?
• If I’m at high risk of breast cancer, should I see a genetic counselor?

257,Mallet Finger,https://familydoctor.org/condition/mallet-finger/,"Mallet finger is an injury to your fingertip. It is common in sports, especially baseball and basketball. Mallet finger usually happens when a ball hits the end of your finger. This can cause injury to tendons in the finger, which causes mallet finger.","Your finger may be painful, swollen, and bruised. You may also have trouble straightening it. When you do, the tip of your finger stays pointing down toward your palm.","Mallet finger most often happens when there is an injury to the tendon on the top or back side of your finger. Tendons attach muscles to bones. The tendon in the tip of your finger allows your fingertip to bend and straighten. When it is injured, you can’t straighten the fingertip anymore. The injury usually happens when the tendon is torn or stretched. It can also happen if the tendon is ripped off the bone or pulls a piece of bone away from the rest of the finger bone.",Your doctor can diagnose mallet finger by looking at your finger. They will ask what activity you were doing when you injured it. Your doctor may order X-rays to see if there is a break in the bone.,"Mallet finger is an accidental injury, so it can be hard to prevent it. It usually happens when playing sports. Practicing good sports safety is important.","If you have injured your finger and it is painful, swollen, or difficult to straighten, see your doctor right away. Delaying treatment can cause permanent damage or may make your injury more difficult to fix.

In most cases, your doctor may tell you to put ice on the injury to prevent swelling. He or she will provide a splint for your finger. This will keep your finger from bending while it heals. It is important to remember not to bend your fingertip at all until it is completely healed. You may need someone to help you change your splint. If your injury is more severe (for example, if a bone is broken or a joint is out of place), you may need surgery.

In most cases, pain from mallet finger can be treated using over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.","If you’ve only stretched the tendon, you will wear a splint all the time for 4 to 6 weeks. If it is torn or pulled off the bone, you will wear a splint all the time for 6 to 8 weeks. After that, you’ll wear the splint at bedtime for an additional 2 to 3 weeks.

You should be able to resume normal activities right after treatment. Most people can still play sports with a finger splint. Your doctor will let you know when it’s safe to play sports without a splint.

Sometimes even with treatment, your fingertip could still have a slight tilt to it.","• What is the best treatment option? Do I need to wear a splint?
• How long before I can expect relief from my symptoms?

258,Mass Psychogenic Illness,https://familydoctor.org/condition/mass-psychogenic-illness/,"Mass psychogenic illness is when people in a group start feeling sick at the same time even though there is no physical or environmental reason for them to be sick. It is sometimes called mass hysteria or epidemic hysteria. People could think they’ve been exposed to something dangerous, like a germ or a toxin (poison). This could happen to a class in a school or workers in an office.","The symptoms of mass psychogenic illness depend on what sickness people believe they’ve been exposed to. Some symptoms they could experience include:

• Headache
• Dizziness
• Faintness
• Weakness
• A choking feeling
• Itching or rash","Many outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness start with an environmental “trigger.” The environmental trigger can be a bad smell or a suspicious-looking substance. Or it could be something else that makes people in a group believe they have been exposed to a germ or a poison. When this happens, many of them may begin to experience symptoms of sickness at the same time. In some cases, one person gets sick and then other people in the group also start feeling sick.","The following might indicate that a group sickness is caused by mass psychogenic illness:

• Many people get sick at the same time.
• Physical exams and tests show normal results.
• Doctors can’t find anything in the group’s environment that would make people sick. This could be some kind of poison in the air, water, or food.

The patterns of the outbreak might also give evidence of mass psychogenic illness. These could include:

• The kinds of illnesses that are reported.
• The kinds of people who are affected.
• The way the illness spreads.

However, if you have any of the following symptoms, you should see your doctor:

• Illness that lasts several days
• Fever
• Muscles twitching
• Tears keep coming from your eyes.

You might think you are involved in an outbreak, but you aren’t showing any signs yet. In this case, it might help to remove yourself from the situation. This could prevent you from developing symptoms.","Most outbreaks stop when people get away from the place where the illness started. The signs of illness tend to go away once people are examined and doctors find that they do not have a dangerous illness. It is important to keep the people who feel sick away from the commotion and stress of the outbreak.

After experts check out the place where the outbreak started, they can tell people whether it is safe to go back to that place.","We all are in group settings at some points in our lives. This could be in school, at work, or in a living situation. It is easy to share stress and anxiety in these situations. Try not to get caught up in other people’s anxiety. Keep a calm and level head. Don’t assume that because someone else is sick that you are going to get sick too. This is probably the best you can do to protect yourself when living or working in group settings.","• Why am I feeling this way if there’s no medical reason for it?

It has happened all around the world and in many different social settings. No one keeps track of these outbreaks. But they are probably a lot more common than we realize.

Outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness show us how stress affects us. Think of how stage fright can cause nausea, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, a racing heart, a stomachache, or diarrhea. Your body can have a similar strong reaction to other stressful situations. People who feel sick in an outbreak of mass psychogenic illness really believe they may have been exposed to something harmful.

Outbreaks also show how other people’s feelings and behavior can affect the way we feel. An outbreak of mass psychogenic illness is a time of anxiety and worry. A lot of media coverage or the presence of ambulances or emergency workers can make you and other people feel more anxious. At such a time, if you hear about or see someone get sick, it can be enough to make you feel sick too.

No, it is real. People who are involved in these outbreaks have real signs of sickness that are not imagined. They really do have headaches, or they really do feel dizzy. But in cases of mass psychogenic illness, these symptoms are not caused by a poison or a germ. The symptoms are caused by stress and anxiety, or by your belief that you have been exposed to something harmful.

Psychogenic illness can affect normal, healthy people. Just because you reacted this way to the threat of something dangerous does not mean there is something wrong with your mind."
259,Mastitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/mastitis/,"Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast. It is usually caused by an infection. It often happens while a woman is breastfeeding, especially during the first 6-12 weeks. Having mastitis does not raise your risk of developing breast cancer.

Women who have mastitis may feel ill. They may feel run down or achy. In addition to an inflamed breast, they may feel like they have the flu. Other","symptoms may include:

• Breast pain
• Breast swelling
• A tender, red, wedge-shaped area on the breast
• A breast that is warm or hot to the touch
• A burning sensation while breastfeeding
• Discharge from the nipple
• Fever
• Chills
• Nausea or vomiting

Mastitis usually affects only one breast at a time.","Mastitis is usually caused by germs (bacteria) that are found on the skin or in your baby’s mouth. These bacteria can enter your breast through a milk duct opening or a crack in the nipple.

Infection is more likely to happen when milk is trapped in the breast. Stagnant milk sitting in the breast makes bacteria grow, which leads to infection. Trapped milk can happen due to inexperience or poor technique in breastfeeding. Sometimes a milk duct can get blocked, causing milk to back up in the breast.

You may be at higher risk of developing mastitis if you:

• Have sore or cracked nipples
• Use only one position to breastfeed (using different positions helps make sure you completely drain the breast)
• Wear a tight-fitting bra or put pressure on your breasts (which can restrict milk flow)","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected breast. They will check for swelling, tenderness, and a painful, wedge-shaped area on the breast that is a tell-tale sign of mastitis.

If you are not breastfeeding and you have symptoms of mastitis, your doctor may order other tests. These could include a breast ultrasound, MRI, mammogram, or biopsy.","Below are some basic breastfeeding techniques to lower your risk of developing mastitis.

• Your baby should latch onto the nipple with their mouth open wide.
• Allow your baby to empty one breast before switching to the other breast.
• Change your baby’s position from one feeding to the next to help empty all the areas of the breast.
• If you need to stop a feeding, break the suction using your finger.
• Don’t wear tight-fitting bras or breast pads that cause your nipples to stay moist after breastfeeding.
• Air your nipples out when possible.
• Tell your doctor or lactation consultant if you have nipple pain during nursing.","Sometimes breast infections go away on their own. If you notice you have symptoms of mastitis, try the following:

• Consider not feeding from the affected breast for 24-48 hours.
• Use anti-inflammatory medications.
• Apply a cold compresses to the sore area.
• Wear a supportive, well-fitting bra. Make sure it isn’t too tight. You don’t want to constrict your milk ducts.

If you don’t start feeling better 24 hours after trying these tips, or if your symptoms are getting worse, call your doctor. You may need medicine.

Your doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. You should start to feel better a few days after starting the antibiotics. But make sure you take all the antibiotics your doctor prescribes to prevent antibiotic resistance.

Over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (brand name: Advil) can help relieve pain. Warm showers can also help relieve the pain.

Although it may be painful, it is important to keep breastfeeding when you have mastitis. Your breast milk will not be bad for your baby, even if you have mastitis, although some infants may not like the taste.

Getting enough rest and drinking extra fluids can help you feel better faster. Talk to your doctor if your symptoms get worse.","If mastitis isn’t treated properly, an abscess (collection of pus) may develop. This could form a mass in your breast. Abscesses are usually painful. They normally must be drained surgically.

Call your doctor right away if you notice any of the following symptoms:

• Infection in both breasts
• Pus or blood in your breastmilk
• Red streaks near the affected area
• Symptoms came on severely and suddenly
• A painful lump that might be an abscess

To prevent these types of complications, call your doctor when you first notice symptoms of mastitis.","• What is the likely cause of my mastitis?
• Is my milk still safe for the baby?
• Do I need antibiotics? How should I take them? Are they safe for the baby?
• I’d like someone to observe my breastfeeding technique. Do you have a lactation consultant on staff?
• Where can I find breastfeeding support?
• Is there anything else I should do to help prevent mastitis?
• Does mastitis increase my risk of breast cancer?","La Leche League International: Mastitis and Sore Breasts

260,Mastocytosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/mastocytosis/,"Mastocytosis is the abnormal growth of mast cells in the body. Mast cells are part of the immune system, which helps protect your body against infection. The most common form of mastocytosis is when mast cells accumulate on the skin, causing reddish-brown spots or bumps. In rare cases, mastocytosis can affect other parts of the body. These include the stomach, the intestines, and the bone marrow.

Mastocytosis can occur in people of any age. It is usually mild in children, and they often outgrow it.

Mast cells are a kind of cell made by your bone marrow. They’re part of your immune system, which helps you fight off infections. There are more of these cells in your skin, lungs, and intestines than in other parts of your body.

Mast cells make a chemical called histamine. Normally, this chemical serves as a kind of alarm. It lets the immune system know that an infection is attacking part of the body. Histamine can cause swelling, itching, and redness. It is released when your body reacts to something like an insect bite or a bee sting (called an allergic reaction).","The symptoms are different, depending on where the extra mast cells are. If there are too many mast cells in your skin, you might have a red and itchy rash. You could get hives or have a rash that looks like freckles. If you rub the rash, it may get red and swollen. Sometimes the mast cells collect at one spot in your skin and cause one large lump.

If the mast cells are in your stomach and intestines, you might have diarrhea and stomach pain. This is a rarer form of mastocytosis.

In some people the extra mast cells cause a serious reaction. It might be like a bad allergy reaction. This is very rare. Their blood pressure may suddenly drop to a low level, causing them to faint. They may have trouble breathing. This reaction can cause death if treatment isn’t started right away.

Possible symptoms of mastocytosis include:

• Red, itchy rash
• Rash that looks like freckles
• Hives
• One large lump on the skin
• Diarrhea
• Stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting
• Fainting
• Difficulty breathing","Doctors don’t know exactly why some people have too many mast cells. Some of the things that trigger the release of histamine from mast cells also cause the symptoms of mastocytosis. Symptoms may be triggered by cold or heat, certain medicines, emotional stress, and insect bites. However, the triggers aren’t the same in every person.","The symptoms of mastocytosis can be similar to the symptoms of many other health problems. Your doctor may do a skin biopsy to find out what is causing your symptoms. To do a biopsy, your doctor removes a small piece of skin and puts it under a microscope to look for extra mast cells. When an adult gets mastocytosis, the doctor may order a bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy allows doctors to look for other blood diseases that might come along with the mastocytosis.

If you don’t have a rash but you have other symptoms, such as diarrhea, your doctor may do a blood test or a urine test.",There is no way to completely avoid mastocytosis. But you may be able to help prevent symptoms by learning what triggers mastocytosis for you.,"There currently is no cure for mastocytosis, but treatment can help stop your symptoms.

Antihistamines (which are often used to treat allergies) are helpful. If a rash bothers you, your doctor may suggest that you be treated with ultraviolet light. If you have diarrhea, an oral version (taken by mouth) of a medicine called cromolyn sodium (brand name: Gastrocrom) may help relieve digestive problems.

The best treatment for mastocytosis may be to stay away from the things that seem to trigger your symptoms. It may help if you and your doctor list all the things that cause you to experience symptoms. Did your symptoms start after you were exposed to heat or cold? Felt stressed? Took a certain medicine? Got an insect bite? Share your list of triggers with your doctor.","Mastocytosis can cause a severe allergic reaction in some people. It’s a good idea to always keep an emergency kit with you. This way, you can give yourself medicine to stop a dangerous reaction. Your emergency kit should include an EpiPen, Benadryl, and Pepcid.","• How will you determine whether I have mastocytosis?
• What treatment is best for me?
• Could I have a dangerous allergic reaction?
• What should I do if I have a bad allergic reaction?
• Will I need to take medicine?
• What can I do at home to help relieve my symptoms?
• Will I have mastocytosis for the rest of my life?
• Will I have to be on medicine for the rest of my life?
• Are my children more likely to have mastocytosis?","National Center for Advancing Translational Science: Mastocytosis

261,Measles: Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/measles/,"With summer travel about to begin and the back-to-school season approaching, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging parents and travelers to be aware of a rise in measles cases. This highly contagious disease can spread quickly, but understanding measles symptoms and treatment and vaccination recommendations can help you take steps to protect your family.

Measles (also called rubeola) is a serious respiratory illness. This means it affects the lungs and breathing tubes. It also causes a rash and a fever. It is one of the most contagious diseases there is, and it can be spread to others very easily. In rare cases, it can be deadly.

Measles used to be a common childhood illness, but in 1971 a vaccine was created to prevent it. Measles had been nearly eliminated in the United States, but measles outbreaks have increased in recent years. According to the CDC, as of July 7, 2023, a total of 18 measles cases were reported by 12 jurisdictions. That may not seem like a lot, but during the same time in 2022 there were just 3 cases. By the end of 2022 there were 121 cases. Compare that to 13 in 2020. Just one infected person can infect 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people they come into close contact with.

The increase in measles cases is partly because of a continued decline in the vaccination rate. During the 2020-21 school year, state-required vaccines among kindergarten students fell from 95% to 94%. During the 2021-2022, it fell again to 93%. Part of this was due to disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s why it’s more important than ever to make sure your child is up to date on vaccinations as they return to in-person learning.

Measles outbreaks also occur when the virus is brought into the country from abroad. The disease is still common in other parts of the world. Twice as many Americans are planning to travel internationally in 2023 compared to 2022. Many other countries such as England have seen measles outbreaks recently. Because of this, the CDC is urging anyone planning to travel to another country to make sure their vaccines are up to date.","Measles often starts with the following symptoms:

• High fever
• Runny nose
• Cough
• Red, watery eyes

A few days after these symptoms start, tiny white spots called Koplik spots may appear inside the mouth. Following this, a rash of small, flat red spots appear on the skin. Sometimes small, raised bumps may appear on top of the flat red spots. The rash usually starts on the face and then spreads down the rest of the body. After a few days, the fever and rash start to slowly go away.

Symptoms usually begin 8 to 12 days after a person has been exposed to the virus. A person infected with the measles virus is contagious for 3 to 5 days before the rash breaks out, and the contagious period continues for 4 days after the rash appears.","A virus causes measles. Infected people spread the virus when they breathe, cough, or sneeze. You can catch measles just by being in the same room with someone who has it—even up to two hours after they leave. Measles spreads very easily. If you get exposed and haven’t received the vaccine, you’ll likely become infected.

In the United States, most measles cases begin when an unvaccinated person travels to a region where the virus is more common. These regions include Europe, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Africa. When those travelers return to the U.S. while infected, they pass the disease to others who aren’t vaccinated. Children who are too young to get the vaccine remain unprotected and can quickly become infected.

People at highest risk of getting measles if unvaccinated include:

• Infants
• Pregnant women
• People with weakened immune systems",Your doctor will examine you. They will ask you about your symptoms. Usually doctors can diagnose measles based on the rash and the Koplik spots (spots in the mouth caused by measles). There is also a test that can be run when a clinical diagnosis is unclear.,"You can almost completely prevent getting measles by getting the measles vaccine. Doctors call it the MMR vaccine, which stands for measles, mumps, and rubella. This single shot protects you from all three diseases. The MMR vaccine is safe, and doctors recommend two doses for the best protection. Children should get the first dose at 12–15 months old and the second at 4–6 years old. Talk to your doctor to find out the best time to vaccinate your child.","There is no cure for measles. The infection must run its course. Treatment usually involves relieving symptoms. This can include:

• Taking over-the-counter pain relievers for pain or fever. Some OTC pain relievers include acetaminophen (1 brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (1 brand name: Advil). Never give aspirin to a child who has a viral Aspirin has been linked to Reye’s syndrome, which can affect the brain and liver.
• Drinking plenty of fluids.
• Getting extra rest.

It is important to keep your child out of school or childcare when they have measles. They need to stay away from anyone who may not have been vaccinated against the disease. In some cases, people who have been vaccinated can still get measles, so they should follow their doctor’s instructions on isolation and other precautions.","Before doctors developed the measles vaccine, the disease was common. While some people believe measles isn’t harmful, it can lead to serious health problems. Children under age 5 face the highest risk of complications. About 1 in 4 people who get measles end up in the hospital.

Measles can cause common complications like ear infections and diarrhea. It can also lead to severe complications, such as:

• Pneumonia (a lung infection) – This is the leading cause of death from measles in young children.
• Encephalitis (brain swelling) – This can leave a child deaf or cause intellectual disabilities.

Pneumonia (a lung infection) – This is the leading cause of death from measles in young children.

Encephalitis (brain swelling) – This can leave a child deaf or cause intellectual disabilities.

Make sure you and your child get the measles vaccine. It protects against the disease and offers long-lasting immunity.","• My child has been exposed to measles. What should I know about measles symptoms and treatment?
• How long do I need to keep my child away from others?
• What signs should I look out for that could mean my child is developing complications from measles?
• Why is it important that my child gets the MMR vaccine?

262,Meckel's Diverticulum,https://familydoctor.org/condition/meckels-diverticulum/,"A Meckel’s diverticulum is a small pouch on the wall of the lower part of the small intestine (bowel). A normal intestine does not have a pouch. The condition is congenital, which means it is present at birth. It occurs in a small percentage of the population.","Most people who have a Meckel’s diverticulum have no symptoms. Only a small percentage people who are born with it have problems. Symptoms vary by age. Infants and children may have bleeding from the rectum. Sometimes blood can be seen in the stool. In adults, the intestine may become blocked. Symptoms of this are stomach pain and vomiting. Other symptoms include fever, constipation, decreased ability to pass gas, and swelling of the stomach.",A Meckel’s diverticulum is formed when the fetus is in the womb. The pouch is made up of leftover tissue from the baby’s digestive tract.,"Although a Meckel’s diverticulum exists at birth, doctors do not test for it. Contact your doctor if you or your child develops symptoms. The doctor can do a test called a Meckel’s scan. For the test, the doctor injects a fluid into your body that can be seen by a special camera. If you have a diverticulum, the fluid will gather around the pouch. This allows the doctor to confirm a diagnosis.",You cannot prevent or avoid a Meckel’s diverticulum.,"Treatment for a Meckel’s diverticulum is needed for people who have symptoms.

263,Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS),https://familydoctor.org/condition/meconium-aspiration-syndrome-mas/,"Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) happens when a newborn inhales meconium (the baby’s first stool) and/or amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the unborn baby). It can happen before, during, or after labor and delivery.","Newborn babies with MAS have trouble breathing. They may breathe too quickly, grunt when they breathe, or use extra muscles to catch their breath. Their skin may have a bluish tint due to lack of oxygen, or a greenish tint from meconium staining. Their blood pressure may also be too low.","Meconium aspiration syndrome is caused by the baby’s first stool (feces). It also is caused by amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby while in his or her mother’s uterus). It’s dangerous when the baby inhales either of these substances into his or her lungs before, during, or after birth.","Several signs indicate MAS. Before birth, the fetal monitor may show a slow heart rate. During delivery or at birth, meconium can be seen in the amniotic fluid and on the infant. If the baby has trouble breathing, the doctor will listen to the newborn’s chest and do a blood gas analysis (blood test to assess the baby’s breathing). With MAS, the test will often show a decreased oxygen level and increased carbon dioxide level. This means the baby needs help breathing.","Following your doctor’s advice and taking good care of yourself and your baby during pregnancy can often prevent problems that lead to meconium being present at birth. Smoking during pregnancy can raise the chances of having a baby with MAS. Some additional risk factors for MAS include:

• A pregnancy that goes past 40 weeks
• Diabetes or high blood pressure in the mother
• A long or difficult labor or delivery
• Decreased oxygen to the infant while in utero
• Poor intrauterine growth","Early detection is key. A fetal monitor can detect if your baby is experiencing stress. If your doctor thinks your baby may have inhaled meconium, a special care team should be present during delivery. If after the baby is born, he’s active and crying, no treatment is necessary.

However, if the baby has trouble breathing, the doctor will quickly need to clear away as much meconium as possible to decrease the amount of meconium the baby inhales. They will suction the mouth, nose, and throat. Then they will insert a tube called a laryngoscope down the baby’s throat and into the trachea to remove any meconium there.

If your baby is not breathing or has a low heart rate, a facemask with oxygen can help inflate the baby’s lungs and help him or her breathe. Your baby may need to be monitored closely in a newborn intensive care unit (NICU). In the NICU, they may get:

• Oxygen therapy
• Antibiotics to treat infection
• Surfactant (a substance that helps the lungs expand properly)
• A radiant warmer to control his temperature
• Frequent blood tests to see if he’s getting enough oxygen","Although MAS can be scary for parents, most babies will get better quickly. While rapid breathing may continue for several days, it’s rare for a baby with MAS to experiences any long-term damage. However, babies who experienced MAS may be at higher risk for an asthma-like disease called “reactive airway disease.” This can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, usually when they have a cold or other virus.","• Will my baby need any extra care at home?

264,Melasma,https://familydoctor.org/condition/melasma/,"Melasma is a common skin condition in which brown patches appear on the skin. Melasma most often affects the skin on the face. It can also develop on the forearms and neck.

Melasma is not a serious condition. But it can affect your appearance and the way you feel about it.","Change in skin color is the only symptom of melasma. The brown patches don’t hurt, itch, or physically affect you. The patches are usually an even brown color and are usually symmetrical. They tend to appear on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes melasma. It probably happens when the color-making cells in the skin produce too much color. Anyone can get it, but it is more common among young women. The condition is often associated with the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. You are at increased risk of developing melasma if you are a woman who:

• Takes birth control pills.
• Takes hormone replacement therapy.
• Is pregnant. Melasma often appears during pregnancy, in the second or third trimesters. It is sometimes called the “mask of pregnancy.”

Being out in the sun for too long and too often also puts you at risk for this condition. Melasma is common in people who live in tropical climates. People who have darker skin are also more likely to get it.","Your doctor will be able to tell if you have melasma by looking at your skin. He or she may use a special lamp (called a Wood’s lamp) that uses ultraviolet light for a closer examination of your skin. In rare cases, your doctor may want to take a very small piece of your skin (biopsy) to make sure that the brown patches are melasma.","Since doctors don’t always know what causes melasma, it can be difficult to prevent it. The best way to avoid it is to use a broad spectrum, high SPF sunscreen every day. You should also wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face any time you’ll be out in the sun.","Most people with melasma do not need treatment. Melasma may fade away slowly if you stop taking birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy. If melasma appeared while you were pregnant, it may go away a few months after you have the baby.

If melasma doesn’t fade or it bothers you, it can be treated. Your doctor will probably prescribe a cream that contains hydroquinone. Creams that combine hydroquinone with kojic acid, azelaic acid, tretinoin, corticosteroids, or glycolic acid can also treat melasma. In some cases, your doctor may recommend a chemical peel, microdermabrasion, or laser treatment to help lighten the dark patches.","It may take several months before you see the results of treatment. It’s important to follow your doctor’s recommendations, even if you haven’t seen any improvement yet.

You may need to keep treating your skin even after your melasma goes away. This can help keep it from returning. It is also important to avoid being in the sun and to use sunscreen daily. This will also help prevent melasma from returning.","• Why did I develop melasma?

265,Meniere’s Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/menieres-disease/,"Meniere’s disease is a problem that occurs in your inner ear. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it may be related to a build-up of fluid in the inner ear. Although it can be troublesome, Meniere’s disease is not contagious, and it isn’t fatal.

Meniere’s disease is a chronic (ongoing) problem. People who have the condition don’t have symptoms all the time. When symptoms occur, it’s called an “attack.” Attacks may happen often or just sometimes. Attacks may last from 20 minutes to 2 hours or longer. Meniere’s disease usually occurs in only one ear. But some people have problems in both ears.","During an attack, symptoms include dizziness, a feeling of fullness in the ear, and tinnitus (a ringing sound in the ear). The dizziness is described as a spinning or whirling feeling. It may cause problems with balance and make you feel unstable while walking. Because of the spinning feeling, some people sweat, feel nauseated, and vomit during an attack. You may also notice some hearing loss, especially with sounds that have a low tone.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes Meniere’s Disease. They believe it is related to having extra fluid in the inner ear. This extra fluid could be caused by several factors including allergies, viral infections, genetics, improper drainage of the middle ear, or more.

This condition can develop at any age but is more common in middle-aged adults.","Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms. They will ask you to describe what happens when you have an attack. Your doctor will want to rule out other ear problems, so they may do some tests. These tests might include:

• Hearing tests
• Blood tests
• MRI or CT scan (tests that “take pictures” of the inside of your ears and head)
• Special tests that check your balance and how well your ears work","Because doctors don’t know exactly what causes Meniere’s disease, you may not be able to prevent it. However, you can help control attacks by modifying your lifestyle and diet. Talk to your doctor about treating fluid build-up in your ear.","There is no cure for Meniere’s disease, but your doctor can suggest ways to manage your symptoms, including:

• Changing your diet by limiting your salt intake. This will indirectly control the amount of fluid in your inner ear.
• A medicine called a diuretic (water pill)
• Limiting the amount of caffeine and alcohol in your diet
• Quitting smoking or using other tobacco products
• Treating your allergies to reduce the fluid build-up in your ear

Your doctor also can prescribe medicine to relieve feelings of dizziness and nausea. These medicines may cause you to feel sleepy.

In serious cases of Meniere’s disease (when attacks can’t be controlled by diet or medicine), surgery may be necessary.

Reducing the number of attacks decreases your chances for progressive hearing loss associated with the disease. This hearing loss is often temporary but can be permanent.","Meniere’s disease is often frustrating for people who have it. You may have to change the way you live to control the attacks. You should follow your doctor’s advice about your diet, and about cutting out alcohol, caffeine, and smoking. Since stress may cause an attack, you may have to find ways to limit the stress in your life or learn how to deal with stress more effectively.

Let your family, friends, and co-workers know about the disease. Tell them how they can help you if you have an attack. There are also support groups for people who have this condition.","• How often do attacks occur?
• What should I do when I have an attack?
• How long should I wait before calling my doctor when I have an attack?
• Is there a medicine I can take for the dizziness?
• If I take a diuretic, is there any special diet I should follow?
• If I follow a low-salt diet, are there resources you can recommend for recipes?
• Will my Meniere’s disease ever go away?
• Is there a support group in my area?
• Could Meniere’s disease cause me to permanently lose my hearing?
• Can I drive if I have an attack?","National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, Meniere’s Disease

To cope with the dizziness, keep your eyes aimed at an object that doesn’t move. You will be less likely to vomit if you don’t eat or drink much. When your symptoms go away, get up slowly. You may feel very sleepy and want to sleep for several hours after an attack. If you keep vomiting for more than 24 hours and can’t tolerate liquids, call your doctor."
266,Meningitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/meningitis/,"Meningitis is swelling of the tissue around your brain and spinal cord. There are two common types of meningitis. Viral meningitis is the most common and least serious. It can make you feel like you have the flu. The treatment for viral meningitis if often only supportive, but it may also require anti-viral medicines. Bacterial meningitis is more serious. It can cause brain damage or death if not treated early. Both types are spread through direct contact with an infected person, especially through sharing food and drink.","Symptoms are slightly different for viral and bacterial meningitis.

Viral meningitis symptoms include:

• Fever
• Low energy
• Poor appetite
• Irritability
• Feeling tired
• Stiff neck (in adults)

Bacterial meningitis symptoms appear fast. They include:

• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Confusion
• Your eyes are sensitive to light

Most people think it’s the flu. This delays treatment and puts you at greater risk for complications. Complications can occur within a few hours of the symptoms.

Watch for unusual signs of bacterial meningitis with a sick baby. These include:

• Yellow skin (jaundice)
• Problems sucking while taking a bottle
• High-pitched cry
• Bulge in the soft spot at the top of a newborn’s head

A serious case of untreated bacterial meningitis can cause stroke, hearing loss, permanent brain damage, and death.","Viral meningitis is caused by a group of viruses. This group is common in the late spring to fall. Not everyone who is infected with these viruses will develop meningitis.

Bacterial meningitis is caused by some of the same germs that cause pneumonia and strep throat. These germs also can cause a serious illness called sepsis. Sepsis is your body’s response to serious infection. It can cause your organs to fail, cause damage to your body’s tissue, and even death.

Both types are spread through direct contact with an infected person. This includes sharing food and drink with that person. Viral and bacterial meningitis affect people of all ages. Young babies and young people in close living quarters are more likely to get it. This includes students attending camps and living in college dorms.","Doctors will take a sample of your child’s blood. Your doctor also may take a sample of fluid from your child’s spine. If it is bacterial meningitis, further lab tests from the same sample will help your doctor determine treatment.

For a less serious case of viral meningitis, doctors will swab your child’s nose and throat. They may also swab your child’s bottom. They may ask for a stool sample. For a serious case of viral meningitis, doctors will take a sample of blood and spinal fluid.","Bacterial meningitis can be prevented with a vaccine. Children should get the vaccine at 11 years and a booster at 16 years.

• Do not share food and drinks with others. This includes straws and eating utensils.
• Avoid touching certain things that can transmit the disease (dirty diapers, dirty tissues, used towels).
• Avoid hugging, kissing, or shaking hands with someone who is sick.
• Cough and sneeze into your elbow instead of your hands.
• Wash your hands with soap, regularly.
• Clean common objects (doorknobs, toys, strollers, highchairs, phones, computers, TV remote control).
• Stay home from school or work so you don’t infect others.","Fast response time is important in treating meningitis. If you suspect meningitis, get to a doctor or hospital quickly. Doctors can treat bacterial meningitis early with antibiotics. They also will treat the early symptoms. This includes giving IV fluids. This helps replace what they’ve lost from vomiting or not drinking. Also, they will give over-the-counter pain medicine (two brands: Tylenol, Motrin) for fever and headache. For milder cases of viral meningitis, you may only need rest and fluids. For more serious cases, a hospital stay may be required.

Prescription medicine can treat more serious complications, such as seizures or stroke. Your doctor also may test for hearing loss. He or she may check for brain damage.","See your doctor early to reduce serious complications. Fast response is important. Specialists will treat hearing loss, stroke, seizures, or brain damage. They will show you how to live with the long-term issues you may face.","• Can my child get the meningitis vaccine earlier than age 11? Is it effective at an earlier age?
• Is the removal of spinal fluid painful?
• Is my child at increased risk of meningitis at daycare?
• Is there a time of year when meningitis germs are at their worst?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Meningitis

267,Menopause,https://familydoctor.org/condition/menopause/,"Menopause is when your menstrual periods permanently stop (12 months in a row without a period) and you can no longer become pregnant. It is normal and occurs as you age. Menopause begins and ends differently for each person. It’s normal for menopause to occur anytime from age 40 to age 59. Menopause is a gradual process that can take several years.

Perimenopause is the term for the 3 to 5 years around the time it takes to complete menopause and before your final period. During this time, ovaries produce fewer hormones (estrogen and progesterone). These are the hormones that regulate your menstrual cycle. You will experience fewer periods that are further apart as it comes to an end completely. In general, your periods will likely not follow a pattern during this time.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a treatment for menopause symptoms. It involves taking prescription, synthetic hormones (which are made in a laboratory rather than by the body). HRT can involve taking estrogen alone or estrogen combined with another hormone, progestin. Some people have found that HRT can relieve menopause symptoms. These symptoms include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and some urinary problems. However, HRT is not for everyone. It does have its risks, including stroke, blood clots, and cancer. Recent studies suggest that for most people, the risks of using HRT may outweigh the benefits. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of HRT.

The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. The AAFP also recommends against the use of estrogen for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.

According to the AAFP, “This recommendation applies to postmenopausal women who are considering hormone replacement therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions. It does not apply to women who are considering hormone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms, or to women who have had premature menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency), or surgical menopause.”

Phytoestrogens are plant-based substances found in some cereals, vegetables, beans and other legumes, and herbs. They may work in the body like a weak form of estrogen. Researchers are studying whether phytoestrogens can be used to relieve some symptoms of menopause. They are also studying the side effects caused by these substances. Many soy products are good sources of phytoestrogens. These include tofu, tempeh, soymilk, and soy nuts. Some studies indicate that soy supplements may reduce hot flashes after menopause.

However, the results haven’t been consistent. There is not enough scientific evidence to recommend the use of herbs that contain phytoestrogens to treat symptoms of menopause. This is also true of pills and creams made with these herbs. In addition, not enough is known about the risks of using these products. Herbs and supplements are not regulated like medicines. Some herbs and supplements can be harmful when combined with certain medicines. If you’re considering using any natural or herbal products to ease your symptoms, talk to your doctor first.","Symptoms of menopause vary. Some people just stop having periods. Most people experience some symptoms, including:

• A change in your menstrual cycle. This is one of the first signs of nearing menopause. You may skip periods, or they may occur closer together. Your flow may be lighter or heavier than usual.
• Hot flashes. Hot flashes are the most common symptom of menopause. When you have a hot flash, you’ll feel warm from your chest to your head. These often happen in wave-like sensations. Your skin may turn red, and you may sweat. You may feel sick to your stomach and dizzy. You may also have a headache and feel like your heart is beating very fast and hard.
• Vaginal dryness. During and after menopause, the skin of your vagina and vulva (the area around your vagina) becomes thinner. Your vagina also loses its ability to produce as much lubrication (wetness) during sexual arousal. These changes can lead to pain during sex. You may need to help supplement vaginal moisture to make having sex less painful. You can use an over-the-counter water-based sexual lubricant (such as K-Y Jelly). Or you can use moisturizers for the vaginal area (such as Vagisil). You can also talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of using prescription estrogen cream for vaginal changes. Topical estrogens are absorbed into the bloodstream and cause many of the same side effects as when they are taken by mouth. Estrogens used vaginally at very low doses will not protect against osteoporosis or stop the hot flashes caused by menopause. They can interact with other medicines and conditions.
• Urinary tract problems. You’re more likely to have bladder and urinary tract infections during and after menopause. Talk to your doctor if you have to go to the bathroom more often or feel an urgent need to urinate. Also let your doctor know if you feel a burning sensation when urinating or are not able to urinate.
• Headaches, night sweats, trouble sleeping, and tiredness. As you’re going through menopause, you may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Night sweats may wake you up. You may not get enough rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (the stage of sleep during which you dream). A lack of REM sleep may make you feel tired, moody, and stressed out.
• Weight gain. Many people gain weight (an average of 5 pounds) during menopause. A healthy diet and exercising most, if not all, days of the week will help keep you fit.

Talk to your doctor if you have:

• A change in your monthly cycle
• Heavy bleeding
• Bleeding that lasts longer than usual
• Bleeding more often than every 3 weeks
• Bleeding after sexual intercourse
• Any blood spotting between periods

Many people experience emotional symptoms during menopause. These symptoms may include sadness, anxiety, and mood swings. For some people, symptoms can be severe. If you find that you’re having emotional problems, talk to your family doctor.","Menopause is a natural process of aging. It occurs as your ovaries stop producing the hormones that control menstruation. These hormones are estrogen and progesterone. Without these hormones, your body will no longer release an egg each month.

The older a person is, the greater their risk of osteoporosis. A person’s risk becomes even greater when they go through menopause. When your estrogen level decreases during menopause, you lose more bone than your body can replace. This makes your bones weaker and more likely to break. To keep your bones strong, it’s important to get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet. These help your body absorb calcium. Your doctor can suggest ways to get more calcium through food, drink, and, possibly, a calcium supplement. They may also suggest that you take a vitamin D supplement to help your body process calcium. Ask your doctor what amount of daily calcium and vitamin D is right for you.

People are more likely to develop heart disease after menopause. Lower estrogen levels may be part of the cause. It also could be that other health issues that are more common as people get older. These include gaining weight, becoming less active, and developing high blood pressure or diabetes. You can reduce your risk of these health problems by eating a variety of healthy, nutrient-rich foods. It also helps to stay active and maintain an appropriate weight.

If you are still having periods as you go through menopause, you may continue to be at risk of a low iron level. This is especially true if your bleeding is heavy, or you spot between periods. This can lead to anemia. Talk with your doctor about the amount of iron that’s right for you. Good sources of iron include spinach, beans, and meat. Your doctor may also suggest that you take an iron supplement.

• Do my symptoms indicate that I might be going through menopause?
• My menstrual cycle is irregular. Could it be caused by something other than menopause?
• I’m uncomfortable and/or don’t feel well. Is there a way to safely treat my symptoms?
• I’ve heard that soy products or herbal supplements may help. Are these effective? Are they good options for me?

Menopause does not require an official diagnosis unless you need to confirm it. Your doctor may order a blood test to check your hormone levels. They will check for estrogen as well as a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).","Menopause cannot be prevented or avoided.

If you have hot flashes, you may want to avoid spicy or hot foods and drinks. These can trigger hot flashes. Alcohol can trigger hot flashes, too. It also interferes with bone growth and calcium absorption. People who are going through menopause should avoid or limit alcohol.","There isn’t a set treatment for menopause. There are ways to manage some of its symptoms. Talk to your doctor if you are struggling with hot flashes, if sex is painful, or if your emotions seem unbalanced.

Yes, other medicines may help ease some menopausal symptoms. These include estrogen cream, low-dose antidepressants, water-based topical creams, soy products, and certain herbal supplements. Discuss these options with your doctor. Topical HRT also is associated with some risks.",Living with menopause is easier for some people than others. It depends on the severity of your symptoms. Use these tips to help ease symptoms and to learn more about how to deal with menopause.,null,null,"The timing of actual menopause is different for each person. The average age for a person to have their last period is about 51. But it’s normal for menopause to occur any time from age 40 to 59. A person often goes through menopause at about the same age as their mother.

You may stop having periods early (before age 40). If so, your doctor can do a blood test to see if you’re going through menopause. If you’re not, the doctor will look for another cause for your missed periods.

Menopause is a gradual process that can take several years. You haven’t fully reached menopause until you haven’t had a period for 12 months. (During this time, keep using birth control if you don’t want to become pregnant.)

People who have both ovaries removed during surgery will go through “surgical menopause” at the time of their surgery. If the uterus is taken out but the ovaries are not, a person will stop having periods, but they will not go through surgical menopause.

The following tips can help reduce sleep problems:

• Eat regular meals at regular times.
• Avoid late-night meals and heavy late-night snacks.
• Limit caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola drinks. Caffeine stays in the bloodstream for up to 6 hours and can interfere with sleep.
• Avoid alcohol. It may make you feel sleepy, but it affects the cycle of REM and non-REM sleep. This may cause you to wake up throughout the night.

• Turn your thermostat down. Sleep in a cool room.
• Dress in layers, so you can remove clothing when you get too warm.
• Wear cotton and other natural fabrics that “breathe” so you don’t get overheated. Use cotton sheets on your bed.
• Drink cool water or other beverages when a hot flash starts.
• Get plenty of exercise.
• Find out what triggers your hot flashes and avoid them. Spicy foods, alcohol, tight clothing, and hot, humid weather are some common triggers."
268,Metabolic Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/metabolic-syndrome/,"Metabolic syndrome is the term used to describe a set of risk factors for heart disease. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes or high blood sugars.

Your body changes most of the food you eat into glucose (a form of sugar). Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin allows glucose to enter all the cells of your body and be used as energy.

For some people, over time, their body’s tissues stop responding to insulin. Doctors refer to this condition as insulin resistance. If you have insulin resistance, your body will make more and more insulin. Because your tissues don’t respond to it, your body can’t use glucose properly.

How does this relate to metabolic syndrome?

Insulin resistance often goes along with other health problems. These include obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. These problems are all risk factors for heart disease. When a person has many of these problems at the same time, doctors commonly call it metabolic syndrome. It is sometimes called insulin resistance syndrome or metabolic syndrome X. Many people who have type 2 diabetes also have metabolic syndrome.","For the most part, metabolic syndrome does not have any true signs or symptoms. If you gain weight around your waist, it can be one indicator of metabolic syndrome.

But some of the other diseases that go along with metabolic syndrome do have symptoms. These include possible frequent urination and unusual thirst when you have diabetes.",A number of factors can act together to cause metabolic syndrome. A person who takes in too many calories and too much saturated fat and does not get enough physical activity may develop metabolic syndrome. Other causes include insulin resistance and a family history of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome.,"Your doctor will do a physical exam and blood tests. He or she can diagnosis metabolic syndrome if at least 3 of the following are true:

• You are overweight or have obesty, and you carry the weight around your middle. For men, this means a waist that measures greater than 40 inches around. For women, it means a waist that measures greater than 35 inches around.
• You have higher than normal blood pressure (130/85 mm Hg or greater).
• You have a higher-than-normal amount of sugar in your blood (a fasting blood sugar of 100 mg/dL or greater).
• You have a higher-than-normal amount of fat in your blood (a triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL or greater).
• You have a lower-than-normal high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level (an HDL level less than 40 mg/dL for men and less than 30 for women). HDL cholesterol is the “good” cholesterol.

The more of these risk factors you have, the higher your risk of heart disease.","A healthy lifestyle can help prevent metabolic syndrome. This includes losing weight if you’re overweight. It also includes getting more physical activity and eating a healthy diet. Also, if you smoke, you should stop.","If you already have metabolic syndrome, making these healthy lifestyle choices can help reduce your risk of heart disease and other health problems. If lifestyle changes alone can’t control your risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help.

Your doctor can measure your body mass index (BMI) to determine a healthy weight for your height. He or she can help you make a plan to lose weight if you’re overweight, and to maintain your weight through a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Carrying extra weight in your abdomen is especially unhealthy. Losing this weight or exchanging it for muscle weight will improve health.

Not being active is one of the biggest risk factors for heart disease. It’s important to get exercise on a regular basis. Start by talking with your family doctor, especially if you haven’t been active for a while. You may need to begin with some light exercise, such as walking. Then you can gradually increase how hard you exercise and for how long. A good goal for many people is to work up to exercising 4 to 6 times a week for 30 to 60 minutes at a time. A minimum of 150 minutes a week is best for good health. Two days of resistance or strength training each week is also recommended for health. Your doctor can help you set a goal that’s right for you.

When combined with exercise, a healthy diet can help you lose weight, lower your cholesterol level, and improve the way your body functions. Foods high in dietary fiber should be a regular part of your diet. You should eat several servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain bread every day. Also, limit the amount of saturated fat, trans fat, sodium (salt), and added sugar in your diet.","Improving your heath through diet and exercise if often enough to prevent metabolic syndrome. You may also need to take medicine for diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Being proactive about your health will help reduce your risk for heart disease.","• I have type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. Is it possible I have metabolic syndrome?
• I have metabolic syndrome. Should I be screened for diabetes?
• Should I talk with a dietitian about changing the way I eat?
• What kind of exercise is best for me?
• Are there any medicines I should take for metabolic syndrome?
• My mother has diabetes. Am I at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome?","National Institutes of Health: What Is Metabolic Syndrome?

269,Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),https://familydoctor.org/condition/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa/,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (commonly known as MRSA) is a subset of bacterial (staph) infection of the skin. Staph is the common name for the bacteria named Staphylococcus aureus. What makes MRSA different from a typical staph infection is its resistance to the antibiotic methicillin and other common antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, oxacillin, and penicillin. This means these antibiotics do not work on the infection. That’s why an MRSA infection is so difficult to treat.

Two main types of MRSA are community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) and health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA).","• Bumps that look like pimples and boils
• Red at the site
• Swelling
• Warm to the touch at the site
• The bumps may be filled with pus or other drainage
• Fever

Cuts, scrapes, and hairy areas of the body are common places for MRSA infections to occur.

Bumps from MRSA skin infections can quickly turn into pus-filled abscesses. These are deep, infected wounds. The bacteria may stay in the skin. They can also spread deep in the body. This could cause possibly life-threatening infections such as pneumonia. If they are not treated properly, MRSA infections can cause sepsis. This is a life-threatening reaction to severe infection in the body which weakens your organs.

If you or a family member experiences MRSA symptoms, it is important to call your family doctor immediately. This is especially important if the symptoms include fever. Do not pick at the infected skin or try to treat it yourself. Be sure to cover the area with a bandage. Wash your hands with soap before and after bandaging the wound.","The MRSA infection is spread through contact with an infected person. This could be skin-to-skin contact or from personal items that have touched the infected skin.

HA-MRSA can spread when health care workers don’t wash their hands well between seeing patients. To kill all the bacteria, hands must be washed thoroughly using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. If this isn’t done, the bacteria can spread from infected patients to healthy ones.

People in hospitals, health care facilities, and nursing homes who have weak immune systems are at risk of more serious complications if they get HA-MRSA. Many things can weaken a person’s immune system. Some chemotherapy drugs and medicines taken after an organ transplant can weaken the immune system. So can having the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Risk factors for getting HA-MRSA include:

• Having surgery
• Having a medical device implanted (such as a catheter)
• Having recent antibiotic treatment

• Overcrowding (as in schools or event venues)
• Frequent skin-to-skin contact
• Compromised skin, such as skin with cuts or scrapes
• Contaminated items and surfaces
• Lack of cleanliness

Daycare centers, dormitories, jails, locker rooms, military barracks, prisons, and schools are common locations for the CA-MRSA.

MRSA outbreaks have also occurred among members of sports teams. This is because skin-to-skin contact, sharing equipment, and minor cuts and scrapes occur frequently.","Several tests can show if you have MRSA. Your doctor may take a sample from your wound or nasal passages. They may also take a sample of urine or blood to send to the laboratory. Results of this type of test (called a culture) should be ready in about 24 to 48 hours. It can take about 48 hours for the bacteria to grow. A newer rapid blood test provides results more quickly, in about 2 hours.","Good hygiene is the best way to avoid MRSA and other bacterial infections:

• Wash your hands often, using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
• If you have any cuts or scrapes, keep them clean and covered with a bandage until they heal.
• Avoid contact with other people’s wounds or bandages.
• Don’t share personal items such as razors, towels, and washcloths.
• Put a towel or other block between you and any other surfaces, such as sitting on a towel in the locker room.","In serious cases, some strains of MRSA respond to antibiotics. Take all the doses of the medicine, even if you’re feeling better, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Contact your doctor if you do not improve after a few days or if the infection gets worse.

For mild cases of MRSA, your doctor may drain the skin boil or abscess and cover the wound with a clean dressing or bandage. The dressing will need to be changed regularly. Your doctor may also prescribe an ointment to apply to the area. Often, this is all that is needed to treat the infection. Schedule a follow-up visit to make sure the site is healing well. Call your doctor if you don’t see any improvement after a few days.

Follow your doctor’s instructions for caring for your infection:

• Keep the area covered until it’s healed.
• Change the dressing as advised.
• Wear disposable gloves to prevent spreading the infection.
• Throw away bandages and tape with the regular trash. (If heavily soiled, first place inside a separate bag.)
• Wash your hands often, using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
• Don’t share any personal items, such as bed or bath linens, clothing, razors, makeup, or sports or office equipment.

If your clothing, sheets, or towels are contaminated with the MRSA bacteria, wash them in hot water (at least 160¬∞F) and laundry detergent. Use a hot dryer rather than air drying. Clean surfaces with household cleaners.

You may need to be hospitalized if:

• You have a severe case of MRSA
• You have other health problems
• Your infection is life-threatening
• Your infection may cause the loss of a limb

When you’re in the hospital, you will be monitored closely and receive powerful antibiotics. These are called broad-spectrum antibiotics because they are designed to fight a wide range of infections.","Healthy people who develop MRSA skin infections rarely develop more serious problems. But people who have weak immune systems and who get HA-MRSA can develop serious, even life-threatening infections.

MRSA can be carried in the nasal passages and spread even if you don’t know you have it and don’t have any symptoms. If you have frequent MRSA infections, your doctor may want to perform a nasal swab to see if your family members are carriers of MRSA.","• I work at a hospital. What can I do to prevent MRSA?
• My husband has MRSA. What can I do to protect myself and my family from getting it?
• How should I care for my wound that was just drained?
• Should I get rid of my bed linens?
• Is there any special way I should get rid of my bandages and wound dressings?
• I have HIV. What should I do if I get infected with MRSA?
• Someone at my child’s daycare was just diagnosed with MRSA. Should I have my child tested for it?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

270,Microscopic Hematuria,https://familydoctor.org/condition/microscopic-hematuria/,"Microscopic hematuria is blood in the urine. “Microscopic” means something is so small that it can only be seen through a special tool called a microscope. So, if you have microscopic hematuria, you have red blood cells in your urine that can’t be seen with the naked eye.","Most of the time, you won’t have symptoms of microscopic hematuria. Sometimes you may feel a burning sensation when you urinate. Or you may feel the urge to urinate more often than usual.","Many times, there is no cause for microscopic hematuria. It comes and goes on its own. Other times, it may be caused by:

• Kidney infections
• Enlarged prostate
• Urinary tract (bladder) infection
• Swelling in the filtering system of the kidneys. This is called “glomerulonephritis.”
• A stone in your bladder or in a kidney
• A disease that runs in families, such as cystic kidney disease
• Some medicines
• A blood disease, like sickle cell anemia
• A tumor in your urinary tract (may or may not be cancer)
• When this is the cause, hematuria will usually go away in 24 hours.","Your doctor will usually start by asking you for a urine sample. They will test your urine (urinalysis) for the presence of red blood cells. Your doctor will also check for other things that might explain what’s wrong. For example, white blood cells in your urine usually means you have an infection. If you do have blood in your urine, your doctor will ask you some questions to find out what caused it.

If the cause isn’t clear, you may need more tests. These may include:

• A blood test
• An ultrasound
• A computed tomography (CT) scan
• A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test
• An intravenous pyelogram. This is like an X-ray that looks at your kidneys and bladder
• A special tool, such as a cytoscope or an endoscope, may be used to look inside your bladder. This type of test is usually done by a special doctor called a urologist.","You may not be able to prevent microscopic hematuria, depending on what causes it.

Later, they will check your urine again to see if the blood is gone. If it’s not, your doctor may perform more tests or refer you to a urologist.","If you have no symptoms of microscopic hematuria, you may not know to alert your doctor.

In the bathroom, wash your hands with soap and warm water first. If you are menstruating, tell your doctor before you give your urine sample.

• For women: Use the antiseptic wipe to clean your vagina. Do this by wiping yourself from front to back 3 times before you urinate. Fold the wipe each time you use it, so that you are wiping with a clean part each time.
• For men: Use the antiseptic wipe to clean the head of your penis. If you’re not circumcised, pull the foreskin back behind the head of the penis before you use the wipe. Move the wipe around the head of your penis before you urinate.
• Start urinating in the toilet. About halfway through the urination, start catching the urine in the cup.
• Wash your hands with soap and warm water.
• Give the sample to the nurse. Someone will look at your urine under a microscope to see if it has blood in it."
271,Migraines,https://familydoctor.org/condition/migraine/,"A migraine is usually an intense pounding headache that can last for hours or even days. The pounding or pulsing pain usually begins in the forehead, the side of the head, or around the eyes. The headache gradually gets worse. Just about any movement, activity, bright light, or loud noise seems to make it hurt more. Nausea and vomiting are common during a migraine.

Migraines may happen only once or twice a year, or as often as daily. Women are more likely to have migraines than men.

Some risk factors make you more likely to get migraine headaches. Other things may trigger a migraine.","Possible symptoms of migraines include:

• Intense throbbing or dull aching pain on one side of your head or both sides
• Pain that worsens with physical activity
• Nausea or vomiting
• Changes in how you see, blurred vision or blind spots
• Being bothered by light, noise, or odors
• Feeling tired and/or confused
• Stuffy nose
• Feeling cold or sweaty
• Stiff or tender neck
• Lightheadedness
• Tender scalp","Researchers do not yet understand all the factors that cause migraines. It appears they may be caused in part by changes in the level of a body chemical called serotonin. Serotonin plays many roles in the body and affects blood vessels. When serotonin levels are high, blood vessels constrict (shrink). When serotonin levels fall, the blood vessels dilate (swell). This swelling can cause pain or other problems. Another cause being studied is that migraine headaches go along with a spreading pattern of electrical activity in the brain.

Some research suggests there could be a heredity factor for migraines, meaning they may run in families. Researchers have identified some genes associated with migraines. They are unsure why these genes impact some people more than others. The American Migraine Foundation reports that if one of your parents has migraines, there is a 50% chance that you will, too. If both of your parents have migraines, your chances jump up to 75%. Ultimately, migraines seem to be caused by a combination of factors: genetic, environmental, and lifestyle.

Women are more likely to have chronic migraines (migraines that occur 15 days a month or more). This is likely linked to hormones. Hormones fluctuate each month around the time of your period. They can also fluctuate if you are pregnant or going through menopause.

Family history: You are much more likely to have migraines if one or both of your parents had migraines.

Sex: Women are more likely than men to have migraines.

Age: Most people have their first migraine during adolescence, but migraines can start at any age, usually before age 40.

• Food and drink: Certain food and drink (see list below) may cause migraines. Dehydration and dieting or skipping meals may also trigger migraines.
• Hormone changes: Women may experience migraines related to their menstrual cycles, to menopause, or to using hormonal birth control or hormone replacement therapy.
• Stress: Stress may trigger migraines. Stress includes feeling overwhelmed at home or work. But you can also become stressed by exercising too much or not getting enough sleep.
• Senses: Loud sounds, bright lights (such as flashing lights or sunlight), or strong smells (such as paint fumes or some perfumes) may trigger migraines.
• Medicines: Certain medicines may trigger migraines. If you think your migraines might be related to your medicine, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine.
• Illness: Infections, such as the cold or the flu, may trigger migraines, especially in children.","Your doctor can diagnose migraines by the symptoms you describe. In addition, your doctor will perform a physical exam. Your doctor might want to do blood tests or imaging tests, such as an MRI or CAT scan of the brain. These tests can ensure there are no other causes for the headache. You may also be asked to keep a migraine journal. This can help your doctor identify the things that might cause your migraines.

If headache pain is getting in the way of your daily activities, it’s time to see your family doctor. Read More","Medicine to prevent migraines may be helpful if your headaches happen more than 2 times a month. You may want to consider this medicine if your headaches make it hard for you to work and function. These medicines are taken every day, whether you have a headache or not.

Preventive medications for migraines can include prescription drugs often used to treat other ailments. Anti-seizure medicines, antidepressants, medicines to lower blood pressure, and even Botox injections are some of the preventive medications your doctor may prescribe. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors can also help prevent migraines. They do so by blocking a gene-related peptide in your sensory nerves. This peptide is known to increase during a migraine attack, so blocking it can help prevent migraines.

There are also a number of non-medical treatments designed to help minimize migraine pain and frequency. One is an electrical stimulation device, which has been approved by the FDA. It is a headband that you wear once a day for 20 minutes to stimulate the nerve linked to migraines. Another non-medical treatment is counseling aimed at helping you feel in more control of your migraines. This counseling works best when paired with medical prevention of migraines as well.

What else can I do to prevent migraines?

While there are no sure ways to keep from having migraine headaches, here are some things that may help:

• Eat regularly and do not skip meals.
• Keep a regular sleep schedule.
• Exercise regularly. Aerobic exercise can reduce tension and keep your weight in check. Obesity can contribute to migraines.
• Keep a migraine journal to track what triggers your migraines and what treatments are most helpful.","There are 2 types of medicines for migraine treatments (abortive and preventive). One type, called “abortive,” focuses on stopping the headache from becoming severe and relieving the headache pain. You should start this type of treatment as soon as you think you’re getting a migraine. The other type, called “prophylactic” or “preventive” includes medicines that are taken every day to reduce how often headaches occur (outlined in the section above).

Talk to your doctor about which of these two types of medicine is best for you. Some people use both types. Nonprescription and prescription medicines that are used often or in large doses may cause other problems.","Migraines can come on quickly, many times without warning. They can ruin your day—or even several days at a time. They can make you miss work, miss important events, miss out on fun. If you have recurring migraines, you probably feel like you don’t have total control of your life.

Work with your doctor to take back control. Keep a migraine journal. Document when you get migraines and what you were doing and eating. Keep a record of what the weather was like and if you were exposed to unusual smells or environments. Knowing your triggers can help you prevent migraines. You doctor also may prescribe different medicines or combinations of medicines. Doing this helps sort out which will be most effective for preventing migraines or stopping them when they start.","• How can I prevent a migraine? Are there lifestyle habits I can change?
• Can migraines be cured? What about medicine?
• What are some possible side effects of migraine medicine?
• What should I be writing in my migraine journal?
• Will my child grow out of having migraines?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Migraine

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","There are different types of migraine headaches. The most common types of migraines are classic migraines and common migraines.

Classic migraines (also called complicated migraines) start with a warning sign called an aura. These types of migraines are sometimes also called “migraines with aura.” The aura involves changes in the way you see. You may see flashing lights, colors, a pattern of lines, or shadows. It’s possible to temporarily lose some of your vision, such as your side vision.

You may also feel a strange prickly or burning sensation or have muscle weakness on one side of your body. Speaking/communicating may become difficult. You may also feel depressed, irritable, and restless.

Auras last about 15 to 30 minutes. Auras may occur before or after your head pain. Sometimes the pain and aura overlap, or the pain never occurs. The head pain of classic migraines may occur on one side of your head or on both sides.

Common migraines don’t start with an aura. For this reason, these types of migraines are also called “migraines without aura.” Common migraines may start more slowly than classic migraines, last longer, and interfere more with daily activities. The pain of common migraines may be on only one side of your head. Most people who have migraines have common migraines (they don’t have an aura).

Migraines without head pain, sometimes called “silent migraines,” may cause you to feel other migraine symptoms, but not pain. This means you may not have the usual migraine pain around your eyes and temples. This type of migraine may even include an aura phase. You may also feel the same sensitivity to light and sound as with a typical migraine.

Hemiplegic migraines cause one side of your body to become weak, similar to having a stroke. These symptoms are only temporary. They are a part of the migraine attack. Areas of the body affected by the weakness may include your face, arm, or leg. The weakness may last from an hour to even days. It most often goes away within 24 hours. For this type of migraine, the head pain can come before or after the weakness. This type of migraine is rare.

Retinal migraines (also called ocular migraines) cause changes in vision that are not related to aura vision changes. For retinal migraines, symptoms involve vision problems or even blindness in one eye. These symptoms do not last long. They can occur before or after head pain. If you experience this type of migraine, contact your doctor.

Icepick headaches are not migraine headaches. They produce a stabbing pain around your eyes and temples. These stabbing pains may occur repeatedly in the same place or jump around to different areas each time. This type of headache can occur at any time and without warning. If you are a person who has migraine headaches, you are more likely to get icepick headaches, too.

Cluster headaches are not migraine headaches. They are rare headaches that occur in patterns, known as cluster periods. These periods can mean having a headache at the same time every day for a week or even a month. Cluster headaches can be extremely painful. They usually cause pain on one side of your head. This pain can be so severe that it makes your eyelid droop and your nose get stuffy.

Cervicogenic headaches are not migraine headaches. They are headaches caused by another illness or physical condition, usually a problem in your neck. Many times, this type of headache can be brought on by a sudden movement of your neck. You might also get a cervicogenic headache after keeping your neck in the same position for too long. You might notice more tightness or tenderness of your neck muscles. The pain can last for hours or days. It may be limited to one side of your head or face.

The pain of a migraine headache can be intense. It can interfere with your daily activities. Migraines aren’t the same for everyone. Possible symptoms of migraines are listed below. You may have a “premonition” several hours to a day before your headache starts. Premonitions are feelings you feel when a migraine is coming. These feelings can include intense energy, fatigue, food cravings, thirst, and mood changes.

• Aged, canned, cured, or processed meat (including bologna, game, ham, herring, hot dogs, pepperoni, and sausage)
• Aged cheese
• Alcoholic beverages (especially red wine)
• Aspartame
• Avocados
• Beans (including pole, broad, lima, Italian, navy, pinto, and garbanzo)
• Brewer’s yeast (including fresh yeast coffee cake, donuts, and sourdough bread)
• Caffeine (in excess)
• Canned soup or bouillon cubes
• Chocolate, cocoa, and carob
• Cultured dairy products (such as buttermilk and sour cream)
• Lentils
• Meat tenderizer
• Monosodium glutamate (MSG)
• Nuts and peanut butter
• Onions (except small amounts for flavoring)
• Papaya
• Passion fruit
• Pea pods
• Pickled, preserved or marinated foods (such as olives and pickles, and some snack foods)
• Raisins
• Red plums
• Sauerkraut
• Seasoned salt
• Snow peas
• Soy sauce

For mild to moderate migraines, over-the-counter medicines that may help relieve migraine pain include:

• Aspirin
• Acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol)
• An acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine combination (one brand name: Excedrin Migraine)
• Ibuprofen (one brand name: Motrin)
• Naproxen (brand name: Aleve)
• Ketoprofen (brand name: Orudis KT)

People who have more severe migraines may need to try “abortive” prescription medicines. A medicine called ergotamine can be effective alone or combined with other medicines. Dihydroergotamine is related to ergotamine and can be helpful. Other prescription medicines for migraines include sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan.

If the pain won’t go away, stronger pain medicine may be needed, such as a narcotic, or medicines that contain a barbiturate (sleep-inducing medicine). These medicines can be habit-forming and should be used cautiously. Your doctor may prescribe these only if they are needed and only for a short period of time.

To help manage your migraine pain, try the following:

• Lie down in a dark, quiet room.
• Put a cold compress or cloth over your forehead or behind your neck.
• Massage your scalp using a lot of pressure.
• Put pressure on your temples.
• Have some caffeine."
272,Mitral Valve Prolapse,https://familydoctor.org/condition/mitral-valve-prolapse/,"Mitral valve prolapse is a problem in your heart. Your heart has four chambers. The mitral valve controls the flow of blood between 2 of the chambers. These are the left atrium and the left ventricle. Normally, when the heart relaxes in between beats, the 2 flaps of the mitral valve swing open to let blood flow from the atrium to the ventricle. The flaps normally open only one way and the blood only flows one way.

If you have mitral valve prolapse, the flaps of the mitral valve are “floppy” and don’t close properly. Sometimes this can allow blood to leak from the ventricle back into the atrium. When this happens, you may experience symptoms.

Approximately 2% of Americans have mitral valve prolapse. More women have it than men.","Most people don’t know that they have mitral valve prolapse. It often causes no symptoms. If the blood leaks back into the atrium, you may have symptoms that can include:

• Feeling like your heart is racing or is skipping beats
• Chest pain that comes now and then
• Shortness of breath (sometimes worse with exertion)
• Anxiety or panic","Doctors don’t know the exact cause of mitral valve prolapse. People are usually born with it. It tends to run in families. You could have a higher risk of mitral valve prolapse if you have certain conditions, including:

• Connective tissue disorders (Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)
• Graves’ disease
• Skeletal problems, such as scoliosis
• Muscular dystrophy
• History of rheumatic fever","Usually, your doctor will find mitral valve prolapse during a regular exam. When listening to your heart with a stethoscope, your doctor may hear the flap of your mitral valve make a clicking sound. If blood is flowing back into the atrium, your doctor will hear a “whooshing” sound. This sound is called a murmur.

To find out how well your valve is working, your doctor may order an echocardiogram. This provides a picture of your heart that shows your valve as the blood flows through it. This can help your doctor decide if you need treatment. Other tests that can help diagnose mitral valve prolapse include a chest X-ray or an EKG.","There is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid mitral valve prolapse. Most people are born with it.

One complication from mitral valve prolapse is called infective endocarditis (IE). This is an infection in your heart. If you have mitral valve prolapse, antibiotics can prevent you from getting IE. If you’re at high risk of getting IE, you can take antibiotics before surgeries or dental work to avoid getting the infection. Talk to your doctor about the risks vs. benefits of taking antibiotics to prevent IE.","Most people who have mitral valve prolapse don’t need any treatment. Only about 2 of every 100 people who have this condition have complications. Your doctor will tell you if you need treatment.

Some people who have mitral valve prolapse must limit participation in competitive sports. If your mitral valve prolapse causes chest pain or other symptoms, your doctor might prescribe medicines such as beta blockers to make your symptoms better. If your symptoms are more significant, your doctor could prescribe other medicines, such as:

• Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots
• Diuretics to remove excess fluid
• Heart rhythm medicines to regulate your heart rhythm
• Vasodilators to widen your blood vessels and reduce your heart’s workload

Some people may need surgery to fix the problem. This could happen if your valve is very abnormal, or if a lot of blood is flowing in the wrong direction. Your doctor will operate to repair or replace the mitral valve.","Most people with mitral valve prolapse can lead normal, active lives. They don’t have symptoms and don’t need treatment. If you do have symptoms, they can normally be controlled with medicine.

If you have mitral valve prolapse, you do need ongoing care. You should have follow-up visits with your doctor and monitor your symptoms. Always take your prescribed medicine. Call your doctor if your symptoms increase or get worse. It’s also a good idea to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes. These include:

• Eating a healthy diet
• Exercising regularly
• Quitting smoking
• Getting enough sleep
• Managing stress","• How did I get mitral valve prolapse? Was I born with it?
• Is it life threatening?
• Do I need to make any changes to my lifestyle, such as diet or exercise?
• What are some symptoms that would indicate my condition is getting worse?
• Am I at risk for bacterial endocarditis?
• If so, what kind of medical or dental procedures put me at risk for infection?
• Will I need antibiotics before I have one of these procedures?","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Mitral Valve Prolapse

273,Mononucleosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/mononucleosis/,"Mononucleosis (often called “mono”) is a contagious illness. It’s usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, but can be caused by other viruses, too. It’s spread through saliva. For this reason, it’s sometimes called the kissing disease. It’s most common in teens and young adults. However, anyone at any age can get it.","Some of the symptoms of mono are similar to those of a cold or flu. Symptoms often don’t appear until 4 to 6 weeks after you’ve been exposed to the virus. Mono symptoms may not come at the same time, and they may come on gradually. They include:

• Fatigue
• Fever
• Sore throat
• Weakness
• Swollen glands in your neck and armpits
• Swollen spleen or liver
• Loss of appetite

Symptoms in young children are generally mild. In adolescents and young adults, symptoms tend to be more severe.","Most cases of mono are caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. The virus is found in saliva, mucus, and other body fluids. It can be passed between people many ways. It can be passed through exposure to a cough or sneeze or by sharing food utensils (such as drinking glasses, spoons, and forks). Finally, mono can be passed from one person to another through kissing.","Your doctor will probably first ask you some questions about your symptoms. He or she will do a physical exam and look for:

• Swollen lymph nodes in your neck
• Swollen tonsils
• Swollen liver or spleen

Your doctor will probably order blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. One common test used to diagnose mono is called the Monospot test. Sometimes other blood tests are needed if the results of the Monospot test aren’t clear.",There is no vaccine to prevent mono. The best thing you can do to avoid it is to stay away from anyone you know who has it. Don’t kiss or share utensils or other personal items with someone who is sick (or has symptoms).,"There isn’t a cure for mono. The virus will go away on its own. Symptoms usually last about 4 weeks. The main goal of treatment is to relieve your symptoms. Here are some steps you can take to feel better:

• Rest. Sleep helps your body fight infection.
• Drink plenty of fluids. They help prevent dehydration.
• Soothe a sore throat. Gargle with saltwater or suck on throat lozenges, hard candy, or flavored frozen desserts (such as Popsicles).
• Relieve the pain. Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to relieve pain and fever. Do not give aspirin to children. Aspirin has been associated with a rare disease in children called Reye’s syndrome. Reye’s syndrome is a serious illness that can lead to death.","Most people feel better in 2 to 4 weeks. Fatigue may last for several more weeks. In some cases, symptoms can last for 6 months or longer. In addition, mono can sometimes have complications. The main complication is the enlargement of the spleen. The spleen is like a large gland. It’s located in the upper part of your abdomen on the left side. It helps filter your blood. In severe cases of mono, the spleen can rupture (tear open).

A ruptured spleen is rare in people who have mono. But it’s wise to be aware of the signs:

• Sharp pain in the left upper part of your abdomen (under the left chest)
• Feeling lightheaded
• Feeling confused
• Blurred vision
• Fainting

Other complications can include anemia, nervous system problems, or hepatitis with jaundice. These could cause symptoms including:

• Breathing difficulty
• Persistent high fevers (101.5 degrees or higher)
• Severe headache
• Weakness in arms or legs
• Yellow color in your eyes or skin (jaundice)
• Trouble swallowing

Call your doctor right away if you notice any of the above symptoms.","• How did I get mononucleosis?
• I have mononucleosis. Should my girlfriend or boyfriend get tested?
• What’s the best treatment for me?
• How long will it be before I can exercise safely?
• How can I make sure that the rest of my family doesn’t get mono?
• Are there any medicines I can take to feel better?
• How long will I be contagious?
• If I start having pain in my side, should I call my doctor immediately?
• If I have mono once, will I get it again?

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","Antibiotics are not effective against mono. Mono is caused by a virus. Antibiotics don’t work against viruses. If you have a bacterial infection (such as strep throat) in addition to mono, your doctor may give you an antibiotic to treat that infection. Taking antibiotics for mono may cause an itchy rash.

Avoid sports, physical activities, or exercise until your doctor tells you they’re safe. Moving around too much puts you at risk of rupturing (bursting) your spleen, especially if it’s enlarged. A ruptured spleen, while uncommon, causes bleeding that can be fatal. You’ll need to avoid physical activities and contact sports for about 3 to 4 weeks after you’ve had mono—or until your doctor tells you it is safe."
274,Morning Sickness,https://familydoctor.org/condition/morning-sickness/,Morning sickness refers to the nausea and vomiting that some people have when they become pregnant. Morning sickness is very common in early pregnancy. It affects more than half of all pregnant people. A severe case of morning sickness is known as hyperemesis gravidarum.,"Symptoms of morning sickness are nausea and vomiting. These symptoms can occur before or after eating. They can be triggered by smells, movement from those around you, and sometimes by the sight of food.

Don’t be fooled by the fact that it’s called morning sickness. Nausea can strike at any time of day or last throughout the day. It is more common in the morning. But morning sickness can occur even at night.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes morning sickness, but it likely is caused by the sudden increase in hormones during pregnancy.","You don’t usually need a doctor to tell you that you have morning sickness. If you are several weeks pregnant and feeling nauseated, you probably have morning sickness.","There is no proven method for preventing morning sickness. There are ways to lessen the symptoms of morning sickness. These include adjusting when you eat and what you eat. You also may want to evaluate your prenatal vitamin. The iron in your vitamin could be adding to your nausea.

• Keep your mornings slow and calm.
• Avoid poorly ventilated spaces to eliminate the triggers of smells. This includes avoiding smoking (yourself and others).
• Reduce your stress and get as much sleep as you can.","Treatment usually isn’t necessary for morning sickness. But there are some things you can do to help feel better.

Tips to relieve morning sickness:

• Eat small meals throughout the day so that you’re never too full or too hungry.
• Avoid rich, spicy, greasy or fatty foods.
• Avoid foods with smells that bother you or make you nauseated.
• Eat more carbohydrates (plain baked potato, white rice, or dry toast).
• Eat bland foods when you feel nauseated (such as saltine crackers, gelatin desserts such as Jell-O, popsicles, chicken broth, ginger ale, and pretzels).
• The iron in prenatal vitamins can bother some women. If you think your morning sickness is related to your vitamins, talk with your doctor and they may change your vitamins.
• Before getting out of bed in the morning, eat a few saltine crackers to calm your stomach.
• Wearing “acupressure” wrist bands may help some women who have morning sickness. These are sometimes used by passengers on boats to prevent sea sickness. You can buy the bands at drugstores, boating stores, or travel agencies.

If these tips don’t provide some relief from morning sickness, talk to your doctor. Keep in mind that morning sickness does not mean your baby is sick.

Do not take any medicines for morning sickness without talking to your doctor first. They may be able to prescribe the medicine Diclegis, which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating morning sickness. In severe cases, your doctor may admit you to the hospital for IV fluids and monitoring.","Some people who have morning sickness are only nauseated. Other people experience nausea and vomiting as a part of morning sickness. Some people have mild symptoms. Other people have the most severe form of morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum.

No matter what type of morning sickness you have, staying nourished and hydrated is important. Try to continue to eat, even if you vomit afterward. Sometimes keeping your stomach full helps combat feelings of nausea.","• I’m pregnant and I feel ill all the time. Is this normal?
• What can I do to help relieve my symptoms?
• What would be an indication that my morning sickness is putting my baby at risk?
• My morning sickness is severe. Do I need medicine?
• What are the risks and benefits of taking this medicine?
• I’m worried that my baby isn’t getting enough nutrients. Do I need a different prenatal vitamin? Should I make changes to my diet?","March of Dimes: Morning sickness

It’s almost always gone by the second trimester (after 13 weeks, or during the fourth month). However, every person is different, and every pregnancy is different. So, there isn’t a set time that morning sickness may stop.

Morning sickness can only become a problem for your baby if you can’t keep down any foods or fluids. It also may pose a problem if you begin to lose a lot of weight. You should call your doctor if you:

• Have lost more than 2 pounds
• Vomit blood (which can appear bright red or black)
• Have vomited more than 4 times in 1 day
• Have not been able to keep fluids down for more than 1 day"
275,Motion Sickness,https://familydoctor.org/condition/motion-sickness/,"Motion sickness is a sick feeling triggered by movement. It occurs in cars, buses, trains, planes, or boats. It can occur on amusement rides or virtual reality experiences. Seeing the movement of others or things can trigger it. This condition is not life-threatening, however, it can make traveling unpleasant. Planning ahead helps prevent, avoid, or reduce the effects. Other triggers include:

• Being in the back seat of a car unable to see the horizon
• Reading in the car
• Not getting enough air in the car

Motion sickness is common in older people, pregnant women, and children between the ages of 5 and 12. Also, it’s common in people who have migraine headaches. It may be genetic. Once the motion stops, you’ll gradually feel better. In rare cases, the condition is triggered by a problem with your inner ear. This could be due to fluid buildup or an ear infection. Parkinson’s disease is another cause of the condition.","Symptoms can strike without warning. They can get worse quickly. You may feel sick to your stomach (nausea). Other symptoms include vomiting, pale skin, headache, a cold sweat, dizziness, and irritability.","Motion sickness is an imbalance between what you see and what you feel. In the car, the car is moving forward. However, your body is standing still. This imbalance is what causes you to feel sick.",You may notice a pattern of sickness when you travel. See your doctor if you experience motion sickness repeatedly. Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will look inside your ears and at your eyes. Your doctor will ask you questions about your health history before recommending treatment.,"If you know you get motion sickness when traveling, plan ahead. These steps can prevent it or relieve the symptoms:

• Take motion sickness medicine one to two hours before traveling.
• Choose the right seat. The front passenger seat is best in the car. Choose the midpoint on a boat. Sit over the wing on a plane. Face forward on a train. Sit near a window on a train. These seats have fewer bumps. They allow you to see the horizon. If you are on a cruise, book a cabin in the front or middle of the ship. Request a room that is closest to the water level.
• Get plenty of air. Use the air conditioner or roll down the window in a car. Direct the vent toward you on a plane. Sit near a window when you’re on a covered boat.
• Avoid things you can’t change. For example, don’t ride on a speed boat. Waves and bumps can make you sick. If you can’t avoid it, take medicine in advance.
• Don’t read while riding in a car, plane, or boat. Look out the window at the horizon. Look at a distant object.
• Lie down when you feel sick.
• Avoid a heavy meal before or during travel. Eat small portions of plain food instead. Don’t eat greasy, spicy, or acidic foods before or during travel.
• Drink lots of water. Avoid alcohol.
• Talk to your doctor about different therapies. This might include pressure bands (worn on your wrist).

If your symptoms last longer than a few days, see your doctor.","Common medicines that treat motion sickness include Benadryl, Dramamine, and scopolamine. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends scopolamine. It eases nausea and vomiting. It does not make you sleepy. A skin patch works best.

Antihistamines (one brand name: Benadryl) are helpful. However, these usually make you sleepy. Non-drowsy antihistamines are not effective in treating or preventing motion sickness. Another type of medicine is called antiemetics. These are used to treat nausea and vomiting.

Some of these medicines are prescription. Some are available over-the-counter. Talk to your doctor to determine which is best for you. These medicines work best when taken before you travel.

Once nausea begins, eat a few, plain crackers and drink clear, fizzy drinks (ginger ale is best) to relieve nausea.","Planning ahead is the best advice for motion sickness. If your symptoms are mild, medicines are effective. Be sure to carry the proper medications with you while traveling.","• Can medicine help after the symptoms start?

276,Mpox (monkeypox),https://familydoctor.org/condition/mpox/,"Mpox (monkeypox) began making the news following a surge in new cases in summer 2022. This outbreak includes reports of cases in several countries where mpox hadn’t been seen before. This includes the United States. In July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and in August 2022, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the ongoing spread of mpox virus in the U.S. a Public Health Emergency. By 2023, the number of cases decreased drastically.

Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. It has similar symptoms to smallpox, but it is milder and rarely fatal. Though the names sound alike, mpox is not related to chickenpox.","Most infected people have mild cases, but there is risk for serious disease. Mpox can cause several symptoms, including:

• Fever
• Headache
• Muscle aches
• Back ache
• Swollen lymph nodes
• Chills
• Exhaustion

Most people with mpox report a rash that can look like pimples or blisters. It can appear on the face, including the inside of the mouth. It can also appear on other parts of the body including the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus. Sometimes, people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms. Other people only experience a rash.

Most people with mpox report a rash that can look like pimples or blisters. It can appear on the face, including the inside of the mouth. It can also appear on other parts of the body including the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus. Sometimes, people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms. Other people only experience a rash.","Mpox is caused by a virus. The virus can spread from person-to-person in several ways:

• Direct contact with the rash, scabs, or body fluids that are infected
• Respiratory secretions (breathing) during prolonged face to face contact or during kissing, cuddling, or sex
• Touching items (like clothing or linens) that have touched the rash or body fluids of someone who is infected
• An infected pregnant person spreading it to the fetus through the placenta

You can also get the virus by being scratched or bitten by an infected animal. It can also come from meat or other products made from an infected animal.","Because the symptoms of mpox are similar to other diseases, your doctor will have to check for symptoms that are unique to mpox. Swollen lymph nodes are one such symptom. Your doctor may feel along your neck, armpits, or groin to check your lymph nodes for swelling.

If you have a rash or sore, your doctor may use a swab to take a sample and send it to a lab to be tested.","The risk to most people from mpox remains low, and there are many things you can do to reduce your risk even more. Take steps to avoid mpox as you would other viruses. These include:

• Avoiding close skin contact with anyone who has an mpox-like rash (touching, kissing, cuddling, or having sex)
• Not sharing utensils or cups with someone who has mpox
• Not handling bedding, towels, or clothing of an infected person
• Washing your hands often with soap and water
• Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer

The CDC offers guidance for social gatherings and safer sex practices.

There are vaccines for the mpox virus, but these are not yet available in all places. These are recommended for people who have been exposed and who may be at higher risk of being exposed. Mpox vaccine availability will be increasing very soon, so check with your doctor if you feel you would benefit from getting the vaccine.","There are no treatments specifically for mpox. But because it is similar to smallpox, treatments for smallpox have been effective.

Antiviral drugs, such as tecovirimat, may be prescribed by your doctor if you are more likely to get severely ill.","The version of mpox in the current outbreak typically causes mild symptoms for 2-4 weeks and is rarely fatal. The CDC reports that while most people who contract mpox virus will recover, it is a more dangerous condition for those who are immune compromised. Children under age 8, those with compromised immune systems, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding may be more likely to suffer a more severe form of the illness.

The most common long-term effects will likely be scarring from the skin rash and possibly lasting vision loss in cases of eye involvement, which could lead damage to the cornea.","• Am I at a high risk for getting mpox?
• What can I do to avoid mpox?
• Should I get vaccinated for mpox?
• I’m pregnant or breastfeeding, what precautions should I take to avoid passing mpox along to my baby?","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control: Mpox

277,Multiple Myeloma,https://familydoctor.org/condition/multiple-myeloma/,"Multiple myeloma is a kind of cancer in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the tissue inside the bones where new blood cells are made. Multiple myeloma is caused when your body makes too many of a certain blood cell, called a plasma cell. When this happens, the abnormal plasma cells group together and form tumors. These tumors kill the bone cells around them. They also prevent your body from making other blood cells you do need.

The","symptoms of multiple myeloma include:

• Bone pain, especially in the back, ribs, and hips
• Frequent bone fractures
• Constipation and/or increased urination
• Weakness and fatigue
• Feelings of confusion",The cause of multiple myeloma is currently unknown. This cancer usually occurs in people older than 60 years of age. It is slightly more common in men than in women. It often can run in families. Multiple myeloma is also twice as common in Black people than it is in white people. Some studies suggest that workers in agriculture or petroleum-based industries may be at greater risk due to exposure to chemicals.,"Several tests can help your doctor tell if you have multiple myeloma. An X-ray can identify areas of bone loss. Your doctor might order blood tests.

If the multiple myeloma is in a later stage, you may need more tests. Your doctor might want you to have a magnetic resonance imaging scan of your bones (also called an MRI scan). This scan can show if the multiple myeloma is in your spine.

The only way for your doctor to be sure you have multiple myeloma is by using a needle to take a very small sample of the tissue inside your bone. This is called a bone marrow aspiration. It can be done in your doctor’s office. This procedure hurts a little, but no special care is needed afterward.",There is no known way to prevent multiple myeloma.,"There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma. Treatment includes medicine to relieve pain, and chemotherapy to destroy abnormal cells and to slow the development of the disease. You will also need treatment if you have broken bones, a low blood count, infection, or kidney damage. Even with treatment, sometimes your symptoms will be better and sometimes they’ll be worse. The 2 medicines most often used together to treat multiple myeloma are melphalan (a chemotherapy drug) and prednisone (a steroid medicine).

Yes, like most cancer medicines, these medicines have side effects. Your doctor will likely order monthly blood tests to evaluate progress. When melphalan kills the cancer cells, it also kills some of your body’s “good” cells. You may lose some of your hair, but it will grow back after you stop chemotherapy. However, if you have these symptoms, you should call your doctor right away:

• Fever
• Bleeding (such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums or severe bruising)
• Skin rash
• Cough that doesn’t go away

These are some of the more serious side effects of melphalan. While you’re taking melphalan, you must not get pregnant because melphalan might be harmful for the baby.

If the cancer doesn’t respond to a combination of melphalan and prednisone, your doctor may talk with you about other treatments. These may include other medicines, radiation treatments, or a bone marrow transplant.","Even with regular treatment, multiple myeloma may not completely go away. Or, if it does, you may live in fear of it coming back. That can cause much stress for you and your loved ones. Consider joining a support group or talking to a therapist about your feelings. Invite your family to do the same.

If you have multiple myeloma, you should try to stay active. Staying active helps keep the calcium in your bones instead of in your blood, which helps keep your bones strong. You should also eat a balanced diet and drink plenty of fluids.","• What can I do to keep myself as healthy as possible?
• I’m in a lot of pain. Is there anything I can take to stop the pain?
• How long can I live with multiple myeloma?
• I’m having frequent nosebleeds. What can I do to stop them?
• Is multiple myeloma something my children may be prone to?
• I worked around a lot of chemicals when I was younger. Do I need to be screened for multiple myeloma?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Multiple Myeloma

278,Multiple Sclerosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/multiple-sclerosis/,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). Normally, antibodies produced by the immune system help protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign substances. In people who have MS, the immune system attacks the body. Antibodies destroy the substance that surrounds and protects your nerve cells, called the myelin sheath.

The CNS is made up of your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Its job is to quickly send messages back and forth from the brain to different parts of the body. Damaged or destroyed myelin can slow down and block these messages.

• Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). This is a 24-hour episode with neurologic symptoms like MS. It is caused by swollen and damaged myelin. People who have CIS should get a MRI on their brain. If lesions are found, the risk of having MS is increased. Some people may not have future episodes or develop MS.
• Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). This is the most common form of MS. People who have RRMS have relapses, or flare-ups, where new symptoms occur or old symptoms become worse. Then, there is a period of recovery, or remission, where symptoms get better or go away for some time. In RRMS, relapses may be triggered by an infection, such as the flu. The disease does not worsen between flare-ups.
• Primary progressive MS (PPMS). About 15% to 20% of people who have MS develop PPMS. In this form of MS, the disease gets steadily worse, with few or no relapses, remissions, or new brain lesions.
• Secondary progressive MS (SPMS). About 50% of people who have RRMS will develop SPMS. In this form, ongoing relapses and remissions may cause an increase in level of disability and new brain lesions over time.","MS affects normal sensation, thinking, and movement. Symptoms vary depending on the part(s) of the body where the myelin sheath is damaged. Symptoms of MS are often mild. In rare cases, people may have some paralysis and lose the ability to write, speak, or walk

• Vision problems, including double vision, blurriness, partial color blindness, eye pain, and partial or complete loss of vision
• Thinking and memory problems
• Fatigue
• Muscle weakness
• Dizziness
• Numbness or weakness on one side or the bottom half of your body
• Trouble with coordination and balance
• Loss of bowel or bladder control
• Sensations such as numbness or tingling (called “pins and needles”)
• Tremors, spasms, or seizures
• Electric-shock sensations caused by moving your head in a certain way
• Vaginal dryness in women
• Erectile dysfunction in men

Symptoms of MS often come and go. Relapses may last for days, weeks, or months. For it to be considered a relapse, symptoms must last at least 24 hours and occur at least 30 days after the last relapse. During remission, your symptoms may continue or disappear for a while. Lesions can form and permanently affect nerves in that area.

For pregnant women, MS symptoms improve during pregnancy. Unfortunately, symptoms return within a few months of giving birth. Having MS while being pregnant does not put you or your baby at higher risk of complications. This includes pregnancy-induced hypertension (high blood pressure).","The exact cause of MS in unknown. It is most likely the result of genetic and environmental factors. Several viruses have also been linked to MS. A childhood virus may trigger MS later in life.

MS affects women more than twice as often as men. White (Caucasian) people are more likely to develop it than people of other races. MS can run in families. Your risk of MS increases if someone in your family, such as a parent or sibling, has it. MS can affect people of any age, but it often begins between the ages of 20 and 40. If you have another autoimmune disease, such as thyroid disease or Type 1 diabetes, your risk of MS is higher.

Some studies show that where you live can affect your risk of getting MS. People who grow up in areas with a mild climate, such as northern United States or southern Canada, seem to be at a higher risk for MS.","Like other autoimmune diseases, MS can be difficult to diagnose. Most often, the first symptoms of MS are vision problems. Symptoms can also affect different parts of the body. Your doctor will ask about your health history and do a full exam.

Before making a diagnosis, your doctor will want to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. To do this, they may order certain tests, such as:

• Blood tests. Your blood can show signs of illnesses that cause symptoms like those of MS.
• Neurological tests. Your doctor may want you to see a specialist. A neurologist can test how well your central nervous system is working. They will look for changes in eye movements, muscle coordination, weakness, balance, sensation, speech, and reflexes.
• Spinal tap (lumbar puncture). A small amount of fluid taken from your spine can show abnormal amounts of blood cells or proteins associated with MS. A spinal tap can rule out a viral infection or other possible conditions.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI can show detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord, and if there are any lesions, or scars. Lesions aren’t always caused by MS.

To diagnose MS, you must have damaged myelin in at least two areas of the CNS. You also must have had at least two relapses, or episodes, that caused damage. Your doctor also needs to rule out all other potential diagnoses.",You cannot prevent or avoid MS since the cause is unknown.,"There is currently no cure for MS. The goal of treatment is to help you cope with and relieve symptoms, slow the progress of the disease and maintain a good quality of life. This can be done through a combination of medicine and physical, occupational, and speech therapy.

People who have mild symptoms may choose not to take medicine due to potential risks and side effects. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of all drug options.

Certain medicines can help relieve symptoms and treat short-term problems caused by MS:

• Bladder problems: tolterodine, oxybutynin.
• Constipation: stool softener, laxative.
• Depression: venlafaxine, paroxetine.
• Pain: phenytoin, gabapentin.
• Muscle stiffness and spasms: dantrolene, baclofen.
• Urinary problems: desmopressin, methenamine, phenazopyridine.
• Erectile dysfunction: tadalafil, alprostadil.

Other types of medicine can affect the long-term outcomes of the disease.

Interferons are a group of natural proteins made by human cells. Studies show they can slow down the worsening of symptoms. These medicines are often given as an injection (a shot). Examples of interferons used to treat MS are IFN Beta-1a and IFN Beta-1b. Interferons may cause serious liver damage. Other side effects include flu-like symptoms and depression.

Glatiramer acetates are thought to block the cells that damage myelin. It can lead to fewer relapses and fewer new lesions. The medicine is taken as a shot once a day. Side effects may include hives or pain at the injection site, heart tremors, and shortness of breath.

Two other types of medicine may be used to treat severe or advanced MS:

• Natalizumab: This is an option for people who have tried other drugs first and not had good results. It can have serious side effects and should not be used in combination with other disease-modifying drugs. One known side effect is an increased risk of a fatal brain infection.
• Mitoxantrone: This is an option for people who have increased relapse and remission periods, progressive MS, or worsened symptoms. Side effects include weakened immune system and an increased risk of blood and heart disease.

During relapses, affected nerve areas can become inflamed. You may have severe pain and loss of vision or bodily function. Steroids can reduce swelling and allow you to return to normal function sooner. Examples of steroids used to treat MS are prednisone (a pill) and methylprednisolone (a shot). Steroids should be taken to treat short-term symptoms. They do not treat long-term effects of MS.

Different therapies can be helpful for people who have MS:

• Physical Therapy (PT) can help with walking, strength, balance, posture, fatigue, and pain. PT can include stretching and strengthening exercises, and training to use mobility aids like canes, scooters, or wheelchairs. Your therapist can help you adapt your exercise routine to accommodate your symptoms and flare-ups.
• Occupational Therapy (OT) can improve your level of freedom and safety at home and at work. Your therapist can show you how to use tools to help in daily tasks. They can also recommend changes to your home or workspace to make tasks easier. Your therapist may help you learn how to adapt to activities or hobbies that you enjoy.
• Speech Therapy can help you better control muscles used for talking and swallowing.","Living with MS, a chronic (ongoing) illness, can be physically and emotionally hard. Certain lifestyle changes can help improve your quality of life and keep you as strong and healthy as possible.

Eat a well-balanced diet that is low in fat and high in fiber. A nutritious diet will keep your immune system strong and give you the best chance of good health.

Continue to exercise if your doctor says it is okay. Exercise can improve your muscle tone and strength, balance, coordination, and even your mood. Stretching exercises can help with stiffness and mobility.

It is also important to get plenty of rest. MS causes fatigue, so pay attention to your needs. You may have to adapt your work or personal schedule to include time for rest.

Too much heat can cause nerve pain and lead to extreme muscle weakness. Be careful using hot tubs or saunas and taking hot baths or showers. If heat bothers you, find ways to cool down. A cool bath or air conditioning may help

Get support from your friends, family, and community. They can provide encouragement to help you cope with your disease. You can also look to your doctor, who may recommend a counselor or support group. Try to maintain as normal a life as you can and continue to do the things you enjoy. This can help you keep a good mood and healthy state of mind

Multiple sclerosis and pregnancy

Pre-pregnancy planning is important for women. Certain medicines used to treat MS symptoms are not safe for your baby during pregnancy. These include medicines called “disease-modifying drugs.” Another group is called “chemotherapeutic drugs.” This includes azathioprine or methotrexate. Your doctor may suggest that you stop taking these medicines before trying to get pregnant.

Some other medicines that are considered safe during pregnancy can be helpful in treating MS symptoms. Your doctor may recommend that you change medicines while you are trying to get pregnant and during your pregnancy. Some medicines used to treat MS may be passed on to babies during breastfeeding. This is not safe for the baby. Talk to your doctor about your breastfeeding plans.

If MS affects your ability to walk, you may notice that walking is more difficult during pregnancy. This is because the weight you gain during pregnancy can shift your balance. Be extra careful to avoid falls. You may need crutches or other walking assistance devices. You may need to use a wheelchair

You may become tired more easily. This is true later in the pregnancy. Plan so your schedule allows for plenty of rest. Talk to your partner, family, and friends if you need help taking care of other children, doing chores, or running errands.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in pregnant women who have MS. Drink plenty of water. Let your doctor know if you have any symptoms. Your doctor may want you to have monthly urine tests to make sure a UTI doesn’t sneak up on you.

Some women who have MS have damage to the spinal cord. This interferes with the ability to tell when labor starts. This is rare. But it may be a concern for some women. If you have reduced feeling in your pelvic area or abdomen, talk to your doctor. They can talk to you about other clues that labor has started.

Some women who have MS experience nerve damage that prevents the muscles from pushing during delivery. If so, you may need extra help to deliver your baby vaginally. You may need a cesarean section (C-section). You may also need a C-section if you become overly tired during labor. Anesthesia is not any riskier for women who have MS than other women. Babies born to women who have MS have no greater risk of birth defects, physical, or intellectual disabilities.

Make a plan for life after giving birth. Some women experience a “flare” or increase in symptoms after the delivery. You may be extra tired. The risk for post-partum depression is the same for women who have MS and those who do not. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing depression.","• Does MS run in families?

279,Mumps,https://familydoctor.org/condition/mumps/,Mumps is a virus. It causes the glands around your neck (between your ear and jaw) to swell. These glands make the saliva (spit) that helps you chew and swallow food. Mumps is most common in children between 2 to 12 years old who didn’t get the mumps vaccine. You can get mumps as an adult if you did not get the vaccine. Some people call the virus “the mumps.”,"The most noticeable symptom is swelling in the face. Some people refer to this as “chipmunk cheeks.” Swelling can last five to seven days. The other noticeable symptom is neck pain in the area between your ear and jaw. Other symptoms include:

• A high fever (103°F to 104°F) that lasts two to three days
• Chills
• Loss of appetite
• Headache
• Sore throat
• Swelling of the temples

Mild symptoms usually disappear within two weeks.

In serious cases, mumps can affect your organs. This includes testicles, ovaries, the pancreas and the brain. It also can lead to miscarriage, hearing loss and meningitis. Meningitis is an infection that affects the lining of your brain and spinal cord. Call your doctor is you have more severe symptoms. This would include:

• Severe headache
• Stiff neck
• Eye redness
• Drowsiness
• Stomach pain
• Vomiting
• Testicle pain or lump
• Seizures

If you are pregnant and have been exposed to someone with mumps, see your doctor. You should see your doctor even if you are symptom-free.","Mumps is caused by a virus. It is spread by infected saliva. This means it can spread through sneezing, coughing or sharing cups and utensils with an infected person. You cannot get the virus if you’ve been vaccinated for mumps. If you get the virus, symptoms usually appear 12 to 24 days after you’ve been exposed. Your doctor will call this the incubation period.",Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and do a physical exam. Your doctor also may do a throat culture or blood test. A throat culture involves swabbing the back of your throat.,"The mumps can be prevented with a vaccine. The vaccine is called the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It can be given at any age. However, it is usually given to infants 12 to 15 months old. It prevents the mumps in 80 to 90% of people. Two doses are required to be effective. Thanks to this vaccine, very few people get the mumps in the U.S. anymore. Outbreaks can still occur in locations where vaccination rates are low.

If you work in a public setting or in the health care field, you should get vaccinated if you haven’t already.","There is no medicine to treat mumps. It usually goes away on its own within two weeks. Because it is a viral infection, antibiotics do not work. If you or your child has mumps, you can relieve the discomfort:

• Place ice or heat packs on swollen cheeks.
• Take acetaminophen for pain. Take ibuprofen for pain and swelling. Never give aspirin to children or teenagers 18 old or younger. This increases the risk of Reye’s syndrome. Reye’s syndrome is a serious illness that can lead to death.
• Drink lots of fluids.
• Eat soft foods that don’t require much chewing.
• Avoid acidic foods or foods that make your mouth water, such as citrus fruits.
• Gargle with warm salt water several times a day.
• Try popsicles to soothe your throat.
• For swollen testicles, support the scrotum with an athletic supporter. Ice packs may reduce pain. Sterility (not being able to have children) is a very rare complication.
• Avoid public places and close contact for at least five days after symptoms appear. This is when you are the most contagious.

People who have the mumps once become immune to it for life. This means you can’t get it again.","Living with mumps involves living with mild symptoms for two weeks. This will include pain, swelling, loss of appetite, headache, sore throat, fever and chills. The frustrating part of living with mumps is not being able to get out and see people. Because mumps is contagious, you must avoid all contact as much as possible. Long-term complications are rare. This would include organ damage.","• Can I expose spread mumps before I get symptoms?
• Can I pass mumps onto my unborn child?
• Am I at risk for any complications?
• Is the mumps vaccine safe for the elderly or people who have weakened immune systems?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mumps

280,Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/munchausen-syndrome-proxy/,"Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSP) is a specific mental illness most often linked to child abuse. It affects caregivers, especially caregivers of children. It is also known as factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA). Mothers of small children are most often affected by this condition. Fathers or other caregivers can have it as well.

Someone suffering from MSP will act as though the person under their care is sick. They often will falsify medical information. They may lie to medical professionals about the health or condition of the person in their care. People with MSP do this to gain sympathy or for attention.

Someone who has MSP may purposely take action to make their child sick. They knowingly will expose the child to painful or risky medical procedures, even surgeries. They may deliberately create","symptoms in a child by withholding food, poisoning or suffocating the child, giving the child inappropriate medicines, or withholding prescribed medicines. Creating these situations can put the child at extreme risk.

Common illnesses or symptoms that caregivers take MSP victims to the doctor for include:

• Nausea and vomiting
• Diarrhea
• Seizures
• Breathing difficulty and asthma
• Infections
• Allergic reactions
• Fevers of unknown origins
• Other illnesses that require immediate emergency care

Those with MSP are not discouraged by the cost of medical treatments. They don’t worry about how they will manage the bills. Instead, they believe driving up a large hospital bill reinforces the perception that they are doing everything they can for their child. They think others will see them as even better caretakers.

Symptoms that can help identify someone who has MSP can be hard to spot. There are certain personality traits and backgrounds that seem to be common. Many suffered mental, physical, or sexual abuse growing up. Or they received love or attention only when they were sick.

As adults, people with MSP are very interested in medicine. They often work in the medical field and can speak expertly about medical conditions. They are typically very cooperative and friendly with health care professionals. People with MSP always appear to be completely devoted to the well-being of their child.

But to fake symptoms of illness in their child, they may do extreme things. These could include:

• Giving the child certain medicines or substances that will make them throw up or have diarrhea
• Heating up thermometers so it looks like the child has a fever
• Not giving the child enough to eat so it looks like they can’t gain weight
• Adding blood to the child’s urine or stool
• Making up lab results

The child who has a caregiver with MSP will have a history of being in and out of hospitals with unusual health symptoms. Many times, their symptoms do not match any single disease. Symptoms usually get worse when they are alone with their caregiver. Symptoms often disappear in the absence of that person.",Doctors don’t know what causes this mental illness. It may be the result of being abused as a child. Some people with MSP may also have Munchausen syndrome. This is where they fake their own illness to gain attention.,"The ethical issues involved in MSP make it hard to diagnose. Accusing a mother, father, or caretaker of intentionally creating symptoms or making a child sick is a serious matter. Medical professionals will look for symptoms and other incriminating evidence before doing so.

One way to confirm suspicions of MSP is to separate the mother, father, or caregiver from the child, then see if the child’s symptoms improve. Doctors also can evaluate medical records. They can look for patterns that suggest something is off. For example, a child who has been seen for many different illnesses during a short period of time should trigger suspicion. If MSP is suspected, health care providers are required to report it.","Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent MSP. The caregiver must recognize that their feelings about illness are not normal. In those situations, seeking help could prevent them from harming a child.

It is usually up to others to recognize the behavior and stop it before it escalates. If you believe a child is in danger or is currently a victim of MSP, contact a health care professional, the police, or child protective services.","Safety of the child is the No. 1 priority of treatment. The child should be treated for any medical problems they are having and protected from further abuse. They may need to be removed from the care of the affected caregiver. Psychological treatment for the child may be necessary, as well, to help them understand and cope with what has happened to them.

Treatment of the mother, father, or caregiver involved is not as straightforward. Many times, this person will deny playing a role, even when evidence proves it. They often have blurred what is true and what is not. Until they are ready to recognize the truth, it will be difficult for them to get better.

Psychotherapy is recommended for persons who have MSP. During these counseling sessions, the therapist helps the caregiver identify the feelings that caused their harmful behavior. Over time, the caregiver can learn to change that behavior. They can learn to form healthy relationships that don’t rely on someone being sick.

Because this mental illness is linked to child abuse, the syndrome must be reported to the authorities.","Someone living with Munchausen syndrome by proxy has a serious mental illness that puts children’s lives at risk. If you suspect someone you know has this illness, it is important that you notify a health care professional, the police, or child protective services. Call 911 if you know a child who is in immediate danger because of abuse or neglect.

You can also call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-CHILD (1-800-422-4453). Crisis counselors are available to help you figure out next steps. All calls are anonymous and confidential.","• What are some clues that my spouse/child’s caregiver has Munchausen syndrome by proxy?
• What could be causing my spouse/child’s caregiver to act this way?
• What should I do if I suspect someone I know is showing symptoms of Munchausen syndrome by proxy?
• Can someone fully recover from Munchausen syndrome by proxy?","Cleveland Clinic: Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA)

281,Muscular Dystrophy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/muscular-dystrophy/,"Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic diseases that permanently weaken and shrink your muscles. The disease is rare. However, it gets worse over time. Eventually, the muscle weakness will affect your ability to walk, swallow, and breathe. There are several types of muscular dystrophy:

• Duchenne
• Myotonic
• Limb girdle
• Facioscapulohumeral
• Congenital
• Distal
• Oculopharyngeal
• Emery-Dreifuss

Duchenne is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne and Emery-Dreifuss affect males more often than females.","Weakened and shrinking muscles are the underlying cause of the symptoms in each type. The different types of the disease affect different muscle groups. Muscle weakness often begins in one part of your body and progresses to other areas. Symptoms for most types of muscular dystrophy often begin in childhood. However, some people don’t experience their first symptoms until they become an adult.",Family medical history is to blame. Muscular dystrophy is genetic and can be passed down in families.,"If you are having muscle weakness problems, see your doctor. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, medical history, family medical history, and do a physical exam. Your doctor might do an enzyme test. This involves taking a sample of your blood and sending it to a lab. The lab checks for high levels of the creatine kinase (CK) enzyme. CK levels are often elevated in people who have muscular dystrophy. A blood sample also can test your genes for the disease.",This is genetic disease. A pregnant woman can have a prenatal chorionic villus sampling (CVS) test to determine if the baby has muscular dystrophy. Both a man and woman can have a carrier test performed to determine if they carry the muscular dystrophy gene. This involves providing a blood or saliva sample.,"There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. It is permanent and gets worse over time. Your family doctor will work with specialists to diagnose and best treat it.

Certain things can help your symptoms. These include medicine that improves muscle strength and certain therapies (physical, occupational, and speech). Sometimes these things can prevent complications. Certain medical devices and technology also can help. Those items include equipment (such as a walker or a wheelchair) to help you move and be as independent as possible.

A high-fiber, high-protein diet and drinking plenty of fluids are helpful in reducing the risk of problems affected by not being able to move or exercise. These include obesity, constipation, and dehydration.

Surgery to repair a curved or damaged spine is another possible treatment. If your heart is affected, your doctor may prescribe a heart medicine. If your respiratory (breathing) muscles are seriously weakened, you may need a device to help you breathe. This is called a respirator. You may need to use it part or all of the time.","Living with muscular dystrophy becomes more difficult as muscle weakness progresses. It threatens your health and limits your independence. In the later stages of the disease, you may get more respiratory infections. It’s important to get pneumonia and flu vaccines. Choking may also be a hazard as the muscles in your throat affect your ability to swallow.

Emotionally, losing your ability to move your muscles and be independent can be hard on you and your caregiver. Talk to your doctor about ways to cope or for referrals to a local support group.","• If one of my children has muscular dystrophy, is it likely my other children will have it too?
• Does muscular dystrophy contribute to an early death?
• Can a parent be a carrier of muscular dystrophy and not have symptoms?
• Do muscle strengthening exercises help slow the progression of the disease?
• How would I know if someone I am caring for is choking?
• Are there ways to improve the learning disabilities caused by muscular dystrophy?
• If my sibling or in-law has MD, should I get a genetic test to see if I carry that same gene?","Muscular Dystrophy Association

Then it moves to the muscles in your shoulders, lower arms, and legs. As it progresses, it affects your heart and respiratory muscles. A person with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may:

• Fall frequently
• Have difficulty getting out of bed or from a chair
• Have difficulty running and jumping
• Walk on their toes or waddle as they walk
• Have overly large calf muscles
• Experience muscle pain, and stiffness

People with Duchenne muscular dystrophy don’t have enough of a protein in their body called dystrophin. Dystrophin helps stabilize muscle cells.

Symptoms usually appear in your teens or young adult life and are similar to the Duchenne type. Muscle weakness progresses much slower and is less predictable.

Symptoms from this type of muscular dystrophy overlap. Both types affect your ability to relax your muscles. Symptoms include general muscle weakness, facial weakness, shrinking muscle mass, cataracts, and heart problems. Children with type 1 myotonic muscular dystrophy have some learning problems. They can have problems planning ahead and making decisions. It can be difficult for them to organize the information they see (called visual-spatial processing).

Symptoms include muscle weakness in the shoulders, hips, heart, chest muscles, and spine.

Muscle weakness usually begins in the face, shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs before advancing to the eyes, ears, heart, and lower half of the body.

This is a form of type 1 myotonic muscular dystrophy. Symptoms begin with muscle weakness in the neck, arms, trunk, and legs. It can progress to the brain, eyes, throat, heart, chest, nerves, and spine.

Symptoms begin with muscle weakness in the lower arms, hands, lower legs, and feet. Eventually, the weakness moves to your nerves and other muscles.

Symptoms include drooping eyelids and problems swallowing. Eventually, muscle weakness in your arms and legs causes problems moving (walking, kneeling, bending, climbing stairs).

The classic symptom of this form of muscular dystrophy in young children is toe-walking. This is due to having stiff tendons in your heels. People who have this type of muscular dystrophy have difficulty bending their elbows. Muscle weakness progresses to your arm, neck, and spine. This form tends to advance much slower. Some people experience episodes of fainting due to a weakened heart muscle.

Depending on the type, muscular dystrophy can shorten your lifespan. People who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for example, have a life expectancy of under 40 years. But with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, a more typical lifespan is possible."
282,Nail Fungal Infections,https://familydoctor.org/condition/nail-fungal-infections/,A nail infection is caused by a fungus. This infection can happen in toenails and fingernails. It is more common in toenails. A fungal infection of the nail is also called onychomycosis.,"Symptoms affect the nail and can include nails that are:

• Discolored (usually white or yellow)
• Brittle
• Crumbly, or have rough, jagged edges
• Thick
• Separated from the nail bed
• Curled up or down, or are distorted in shape

The infection can cause pain if it is severe. Some people with fungal nail infections have athlete’s foot. This is a similar condition that affects the skin around the toes.

Fungal infections can also lead to ingrown toenails as well.","The infection is usually caused by exposure to a fungus. The fungus grows in wet, dark conditions. The fungus grows when your feet are in warm, sweaty environment (socks, work boots). It enters your nail through a crack in the nail.

Nail fungal infections happen at any age. They are more common in adults older than 60 years of age. They are common in people who have diabetes or circulation problems. They also are common in people with a weakened immune system. Men are more likely than women to get fungal nail infections.",Your doctor will look at your nails and ask you questions. They might clip a sample of your nail and send the sample to a lab to see if you have an infection. There could be other causes for your symptoms and your doctor can help reveal what those are.,"Avoid situations that expose you to a fungus. This includes walking barefoot in locker rooms and having wet hands and feet often. This might be a problem for people who work in restaurants or house cleaning. People in a family can get nail fungal infections at the same time. This happens when their immune systems aren’t able to fight off the infection. Or it could be the infection is spread when using the same towels. It is important to routinely clean your shower, tub, and bathroom to lower risk of fungal infection.","Prescription medicines can treat a fungal nail infection. Oral antifungal medicines help a new nail grow. This will replace the infected nail. You may need to take antifungal medicine for 6 to 12 weeks. Some oral medicines are not safe for people who have liver problems. They are not safe for people who have a history of congestive heart failure. Tell your doctor if you have one of these conditions. Your doctor will decide which medicine is right for you.

Apply topical treatments (creams and polishes) to the top of your nail. Topical medicines usually do not cure fungal nail infections.

In severe cases, a doctor might remove the nail completely. It can take several months to a year for the infection to go away.","If you have a nail fungal infection, some things can help:

• Keep your nails cut short and file down any thick areas.
• Don’t use the same nail trimmer and file on healthy nails and infected nails. If you have your nails professionally manicured, bring your own nail file and trimmer from home.
• Wear waterproof gloves for wet work (such as washing dishes or floors). Wear 100% cotton gloves for dry work.
• Wear socks made of wicking material (high-tech polyester). This pulls moisture away from the skin. Change your socks when they are damp from sweat or if your feet get wet. Put on clean, dry socks every day. Put over-the-counter antifungal foot powder inside your socks to keep your feet dry.
• Wear shoes with good support and a wide toe area. Don’t wear pointed shoes that press your toes together.
• Avoid walking barefoot in public areas, such as locker rooms.","• Are treatments usually effective?
• Are there any side effects of the treatment?
• If my treatment works, will my nail grow back normally?
• If I’ve had one fungal nail infection, am I likely to get another?
• What kinds of shoes should I wear?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Fungal Nail Infections

283,Nasopharyngeal Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/nasopharyngeal-cancer/,Nasopharyngeal cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx is the area where the back part of your nose opens into your upper throat. This is also where tubes from your ears open into your throat.,"If you have nasopharyngeal cancer, you might easily mistake the symptoms for other conditions. You might first notice a lump in your neck. You might have trouble hearing in one ear. You might have nosebleeds, headaches, blurred vision, or ringing in one or both ears. You might notice a change in the way one side of your face feels. You may have trouble breathing or speaking.",No one knows for sure what causes nasopharyngeal cancer. Nasopharyngeal cancer is rare. It most often affects people who are between 30 and 50 years of age. Men are more likely to have nasopharyngeal cancer than women.,"Your doctor might use endoscopy to try to see the cancer. For this exam, a thin tube with a very small camera on the end is put into your nose. This lets your doctor get a closer look at the cancerous tumor.

During endoscopy, your doctor might take a small piece from the tumor. This is called a biopsy sample. They will then send a piece of the tumor to a lab where it is looked at under a microscope.

Your doctor might also send you to have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This MRI takes a special “picture” of your nasopharynx so that your doctor can see the size of the tumor.","Eating salt-preserved foods (like fish, eggs, leafy vegetables, and roots) during early childhood may increase the risk of getting this form of cancer. Exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus may also make a person more likely to get nasopharyngeal cancer. This is the same virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (also called “mono”).

You are most likely to get this cancer if you or your ancestors come from southern China, particularly Canton (now called Guangzhou) or Hong Kong. You are also more likely to get this cancer if you are from a country in Southeast Asia, such as Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, or Thailand.

Tobacco use and excessive alcohol can also raise a person’s risk of developing nasopharyngeal cancer.",Radiation is often successful in treating cancer in the nasopharynx. You might also need to have chemotherapy (medicines used to treat cancer). Radiation and chemotherapy can make you feel tired and sick to your stomach. You might also have headaches for a while after radiation treatment.,Many people with nasopharyngeal cancer can live normal lives. You are more likely to be cured if you find it early and the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.,"• How long will my treatment last?

284,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/necrotizing-enterocolitis/,Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an intestinal disease. Intestinal tissue becomes inflamed and then dies. It occurs mostly in premature and sick newborn babies. It often begins within 2 weeks of birth when the baby is still hospitalized.,"NEC symptoms may begin all of a sudden or over time. Common symptoms include:

• Swollen stomach
• Stomach pain
• Bloody stool
• Change in stool amounts or times
• Diarrhea
• Vomiting
• Feeding problems
• Decreased energy
• Changing body temperature
• Uneven breathing, heart rate, or blood pressure","There is no exact cause for NEC. The main source is intestinal bacteria. If your baby is premature, their immune and digestion systems are weaker. Another trigger could be a decrease in blood or oxygen to the intestine. This can damage tissue and lead to NEC. Full-term babies who have congenital heart disease also can get NEC.","Your doctor can diagnose NEC. They will perform a physical exam to check for symptoms. They will likely do a stomach X-ray to check for inflammation or air in your baby’s intestine. Lab tests, such as blood, urine, and stool, are likely too. These tests can determine the severity of the condition.","It is hard to prevent or avoid NEC. However, there are factors that can increase your baby’s risk for NEC, including:

• Premature birth
• Illness
• Blood transfusion
• Formula instead of breast milk
• Exposure to an outbreak
• Prolonged antibiotic exposure","A range of options is available to treat NEC. To start, your doctor will want to give your baby’s intestine a rest. Instead of normal feedings, they will receive nutrition through an intravenous tube. Your doctor may need to relieve gas in your baby’s bowel. This is done by inserting a tube into the stomach. Antibiotic medicines treat the infection. Your baby may need to use a breathing machine if breathing becomes difficult. Severe cases of NEC may require emergency surgery. This is if the weakened, infected tissue creates a hole in the intestine. The surgeon will remove dead tissue and repair the bowel and intestine.","Babies who have NEC require treatment and ongoing monitoring. NEC can be cured and have little or no lasting effects. Some babies may have future problems. This includes the intestine or digestive tract. They can have blockage caused by abnormal intestinal tissue or scar tissue. Another problem is called short-gut, or short-bowel, syndrome. There also is a risk of death, especially for premature babies.","• Are premature babies screened for necrotizing enterocolitis?

285,Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/,"Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurs in babies who had drug exposure in the womb. After birth, these babies go through drug withdrawal and need medical care.","Babies who have NAS can suffer a wide range of symptoms. Other health conditions and problems also can produce the same symptoms. So you should talk to your doctor if you ingested drugs during pregnancy and see one or more of these warning signs:

• Low birth weight and poor weight gain.
• Extreme or high-pitched crying.
• Fever.
• Fussy or irritable behavior.
• Trouble sleeping.
• Extreme yawning.
• Poor appetite and sucking.
• Hurried breathing.
• Stuffy nose or sneezing.
• Rough or blotchy skin.
• Sweating.
• Vomiting.
• Diarrhea.
• Tremors, twitches, tight muscles, and/or seizures.

These symptoms usually begin 1 day to 1 week after birth. They can last anywhere from 1 week to 6 months. The presence and severity of symptoms vary based on:

• The type and amount of drug used.
• The frequency and duration of drug use.
• How the mother’s body reacts to the drug (genetics).
• If your baby was full-term or premature (born 4 weeks early or more).","Everything you consume in pregnancy gets passed to the baby. The placenta is an organ attached your uterus wall. It provides food and oxygen to your baby through the umbilical cord. Drugs, alcohol, and other substances also travel through the placenta.

If your baby is exposed to drugs in the womb, they go through withdrawal after birth. NAS usually occurs from using opioids or painkillers. This includes:

• heroin
• methadone
• oxycodone
• codeine
• morphine
• buprenorphine

Babies also can get NAS from other addictive substances, such as:

• cocaine
• amphetamines
• marijuana
• nicotine
• alcohol
• barbiturates
• benzodiazepines
• certain antidepressants (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)","NAS symptoms overlap with those of other health conditions and problems. Alert your doctor or nurse if you notice any symptoms. They will examine your baby and ask questions about your drug use.

Urine screening can check for drugs in you and/or your baby. The doctor also can test your baby’s first bowel movements. The neonatal abstinence syndrome scoring system measures symptoms and severity. Your baby is likely to have NAS if they have a high score.","Neonatal abstinence syndrome can be prevented. Avoid opiates and other drugs during pregnancy. You also should avoid alcohol and tobacco. Talk to your doctor about the medicines you take or if you have an addiction. They can help you quit and provide medical care, if needed. Do not stop taking medicine without talking to your doctor.

If you need opioids for health reasons, do not get pregnant. Use birth control or other preventive measures.","If your baby has NAS, the doctor will need to know details of your drug use. This information affects the type(s) of treatment. Factors include the drug, amount, frequency, and length of use. Your baby’s health and birth (full-term or premature) also play a role.

Most likely, your baby will require a hospital stay to treat NAS. Babies who are dehydrated might need IV (intravenous) fluids. High-calorie formula provides added nutrition. You might need to feed your baby more small meals. Also, your baby will need extra attention. Tips to help calm your baby include:

• Gentle rocking or swinging.
• Swaddling.
• Touching skin-on-skin.
• Reducing lights and noise.
• Safe breastfeeding.

Babies who have severe cases of withdrawal require medicine. Your doctor will prescribe a drug similar to the one used for mothers in withdrawal during pregnancy. They start with a high dose and slowly decrease it to wean the baby off the drug.","Treatment should reduce withdrawal symptoms. However, your baby can have lasting effects from NAS and other drug or substance abuse. The following concerns require further observation and care:

• Birth defects.
• A small head.
• Developmental delays or problems.
• Behavior issues.","• What medicines are okay to take when I’m pregnant?

286,Neural Tube Defects,https://familydoctor.org/condition/neural-tube-defects/,"Neural tube defects (NTDs) are birth defects. They affect a baby’s spine, spinal cord, or brain. Very early in pregnancy, cells from the developing fetus gather together to form a tube. From this tube, the brain, spinal cord and spinal column develops. When a portion of that tube fails to form properly, it results in NTDs.

The different kinds of neural tube defects are:

• Spina bifida. This is the most common NTD. It occurs in the base of the fetus’ spinal column. The opening allows part of the spinal cord to poke through the column. Spina bifida comes in several types.
• It occurs in the upper part of the neural tube. This causes unformed sections of the fetus’ brain, skull, and scalp. It is more common in girls than boys.
• This is similar to anencephaly, but rarer. It occurs when part of the brain and membranes poke through the skull.
• Chiara malformation. Also rare, this occurs when brain tissue leaks into the fetus’ spinal canal.","The main sign of NTDs is physical deformities. Symptoms can include paralysis, developmental delays, and seizures.","The exact cause of NTDs is not known. It may be difficult to determine because the defects begin in the first month of pregnancy. A lot of women don’t even know they are pregnant at this stage.

Your risk for having a baby with neural tube defects increases if you:

• Have a family history of NTDs
• Have obesity
• Have diabetes
• Take certain medicines to prevent seizures
• Are of a certain race. NTDs are highest among Hispanics.

Other potential risk factors are genetics and the environment.","A doctor often diagnoses an NTD during pregnancy. The defects can show up on imaging or lab tests. If your doctor sees signs of an NTD, they may perform additional tests.","The best way to help prevent neural tube defects is by taking folic acid. This is a type of B vitamin. You can take it as a supplement or in a multivitamin. Folic acid also is found in some enriched or fortified foods. Things like cereals, breads, pastas, rices, and flours contain higher amounts. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that all women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take folic acid. They need 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 mcg) every day.

Doctors also suggest eating foods high in folate. These include:

• Dark green leafy vegetables (such as spinach)
• Broccoli
• Asparagus
• Beans
• Lentils
• Oranges and orange juice",NTDs do not have cures. Treatment options focus on relieving pain and preventing future damage. Babies who have spina bifida may need surgery to help correct damage.,Babies who have anencephaly do not live. They either are stillborn or die hours after birth. Babies who have other NTDs have lasting effects. Spina bifida can cause paralysis below the spine. Another common issue is difficulty going to the bathroom.,"• How do I know if I need folic acid?

287,Neurofibromatosis | Symptoms and Diagnosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/neurofibromatosis/,"Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disorder. It affects your nervous system and nerve cells. The condition produces tumors on your nerves. The tumors can be underneath or on your skin. Most tumors formed from NF are benign (non-cancerous). However, some can lead to cancer.

There are two main types of neurofibromatosis. Type 1 (NF1) begins at birth or as a child. It also is known as von Recklinghausen’s disease. Type 2 (NF2) appears during late teenage or early adult years. It is less common than NF1. Schwannomatosis is a third and very rare form of NF.","The symptoms of NF vary by type, but all involve tumors.

For the more common NF1, symptoms include:

• Multiple light brown skin spots, called café-au-lait
• Presence of at least 2 neurofibromas (tumors)
• Tumor(s) on your optic (eye) nerve
• Concentrated freckles in your armpits or groin
• Growths on the iris (colored part) of your eye
• Curved spine (scoliosis)
• Deformed bones, such as your skull’s temple (sphenoid)

People who have NF1 can be shorter than normal or have a larger head. Other side effects include body pain, headaches, and epilepsy.

The first apparent sign of NF2 is ringing in your ears or hearing loss. Impaired balance, early onset cataracts, and vision loss can be warning signs. NF2 tumors are called schwannomas.

NF2 tumors can grow along any nerves. The most common are the cranial nerves, which affect your hearing and balance. The tumors can press against or wrap around nerves and cause damage. This is dangerous along the brain stem, spinal cord, and major blood vessels. It can lead to symptoms, such as muscle numbness and weakness.

Schwannomatosis is rare. Its main feature is tumors anywhere except the vestibular nerve. Its main symptom is intense pain. This occurs as tumors grow, squeeze nerves, or crush tissue. Other symptoms include weakness, tingling, or numbness.

NF doesn’t have a cure, but often doesn’t affect the length of your life. It is a disorder in which symptoms worsen over time. Most people who have a form of NF need ongoing treatment. This treatment helps manage related conditions, which can include:

• Congenital heart defects
• Vision problems
• Speech problems
• Learning disabilities
• Cosmetic deformities
• Impaired muscles
• Vertigo

The social and mental aspects of NF can be hard. The condition may keep you from leaving the house or working. Talk to your doctor about counseling or therapy to help you manage the emotional side-effects of NF.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","NF is a genetic disorder. You can get it from your parents or a random gene mutation. If you have the condition, you can pass it on to your children.","There are a few ways to diagnose NF. To start, your doctor will discuss and examine your symptoms. They will look for presence of at least two of the disorder’s symptoms. Tumor appearance, size, and location play a role. Your doctor may do blood or genetic testing. These tests can show gene defects. An X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also can help. They check for tumors in and around your nerves. If your doctor thinks you have NF2, they may do hearing tests.

Café-au-lait spots can also be an indicator of NF. If these are present during the first year of life, they may be a predictor of NF. Having more than 6 café-au-lait spots increases the risk of NF.",You cannot avoid NF. You can have genetic testing to see if you carry the gene.,"With NF, doctors cannot prevent tumor growth.

An auditory brainstem implant is another option.

In severe cases, you may need surgery. A surgeon can remove tumors that cause physical or cosmetic problems. However, there is a chance the tumors can grow back. Surgery can correct some bone deformities.

288,Nightmares and Night Terrors,https://familydoctor.org/condition/nightmares-and-night-terrors/,"Nightmares are scary dreams. They usually start in childhood before the age of 10. But they can occur in adults. Nightmares are more common in girls than boys. They can be triggered by everyday events. Most happen late in the sleep cycle (between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m.). Adults and children often remember the nightmare. It may be difficult to go back to sleep. Some nightmares are recurring

Night terrors differ from nightmares. Night terrors occur more often in children and are rare in adults. They happen during deep sleep (between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.). A night terror will cause a child to wake up screaming. They may be sweating and breathing fast. Your child’s pupils (the black center of the eye) may look larger than normal

Your child may still be asleep but move and look awake. Your child will be confused and might not answer when you talk to him or her. Your child may be difficult to wake. Usually, they won’t remember what happened. Children who have night terrors sometimes sleepwalk.

Typically, night terrors stop in the teen years. Nightmares may continue into adulthood. They may be one way our brain deals with stress and fear. They can be caused by a major life event, increased stress, illness with a fever, or sleep disorder.

If nightmares or night terrors regularly disturb your child’s sleep, they can affect your child’s ability to function during the day. Talk with your doctor about possible solutions that can help.

• Keep a regular bedtime routine.
• Get the recommended amount of sleep each night.
• Do not eat or drink anything just before bed, except water.
• Avoid caffeine and other stimulants at least 5 hours before bed.
• Avoid screen time (including phones) 2 to 4 hours before bed.
• Keep your bedroom cool and comfortable.
• Follow a daily exercise and fitness routine. This can relax your mind and body each day. Don’t exercise too close to your bedtime.
• Learn relaxation techniques. This could include reading, listening to music, yoga, etc.
• Talk to your child about an event when it happens to reduce their anxiety. Encourage your child to write down or draw a picture of what bothers them. Depending upon the seriousness of the event, your child may need counseling.
• Talk to your doctor if you suspect you or your child have an anxiety disorder.
• Have your child checked for the sleep disorder sleep apnea.
• Reduce your alcohol consumption. Be aware of abrupt alcohol withdrawal.
• Do not use illegal drugs or prescription pain medicines.
• Check to see if your child has a fever. Illness can cause nightmares or night terrors.
• Avoid scary movies, especially if you or your child has nightmares after.

If your child experiences nightmares or night terrors, always comfort them immediately.

While nightmares and night terrors are generally harmless, take steps to keep your child safe during the experience.

Do not wake your child by shaking or shouting at them. Keep your room or your child’s free of clutter in case the experience leads to sleepwalking. This will reduce tripping or falling.

Do not give your child over-the-counter medicines that make them sleepy (such as cough syrup or allergy medicine). This is not what those medicines are designed for. It can cause serious breathing problems for your child."
289,Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a form of cancer. It happens when your white blood cells become abnormal. The cancer starts in your body’s lymph system. This includes your lymph nodes, spleen, and other organs. These make up your immune system. Lymph nodes help your body fight infection. They eliminate fluid, waste, and bad cells from your body. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma also can develop in your bone marrow and blood. There are more than 30 types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment and prognosis depend on the type.","• Swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, or groin
• Noticeable and unexplained weight loss
• Fever
• Drenching night sweats
• Chest pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing
• Fatigue
• Stomach pain or bloating

Living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma depends on several factors. These include the stage of your disease, whether you receive treatment, the type of treatment you receive, and your prognosis.

If you choose to undergo treatment, common approaches, such as chemotherapy and radiation, have significant side effects.

Chemotherapy can cause nausea and fatigue. It can cause infection, mouth sores, and hair loss. Radiation can cause similar problems. This includes burns to the skin near the area being treated. It also can cause changes in blood counts.

Immunotherapy side effects include fever, chills, and nausea. More serious side effects include hepatitis and damage to the pancreas.

Targeted therapy side effects include high blood pressure, bleeding, and blood clotting difficulties. That is dependent upon the type of medicine used. Also, it can include delayed wound healing, damage to the heart, swelling, and autoimmune problems (when your body is attacking its immune system). The most significant side effect of targeted therapy is skin problems. This can range from rash to itching and dry skin.

Stem cell transplant side effects include nausea, infection, mouth and throat pain, and bleeding. More serious problems include stem cell rejection, where your body attacks the newer cells.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","The exact cause of most lymphomas is unknown. With non-Hodgkin lymphoma, your body produces too many white blood cells. Normally, white blood cells die and new ones develop. When you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, white blood cells don’t die. They grow uncontrollably. This is what doctors believe contributes to cancer.

Doctors have identified certain risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. People with weakened immune systems are most at risk. This means they don’t have infection-fighting ability. This includes people who have had an organ donation or HIV infection. People who have Down syndrome are at a higher risk. Certain viruses and chemicals can cause the disease. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs in people over the age of 60.","Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will look and feel for lumps in your neck, under your arm, and around your groin. They will ask you about your medical history and assess your risk. Your doctor will likely order a blood test. This involves inserting a small needle into the vein in your arm and withdrawing a small sample of blood. The blood will be sent to a lab. The lab will look at your white blood cell count.

If your doctor finds a lump, they may order an imaging test (similar to an X-ray). This might include an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computed tomography) scan, or PET (positron emission tomography) scan. An ultrasound might be used to see inside your body. This test uses a wand to move around the area in question. It creates pictures from sound waves as it moves across your body.

To diagnose (or rule out) lymphoma, your doctor may order a biopsy. This involves inserting a needle into the lump to sample a small amount of tissue. Your doctor may give you medicine to make you sleep during the procedure. If the biopsy is minor, you may be given medicine to relax you during the procedure. These tests give your doctor information about the type, stage, and severity of the disease.","There is no sure way to prevent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Prevention might be helpful for certain risk factors. For example, reduce your exposure to HIV by practicing safe sex. Reduce your risk of chemical exposure throughout your lifetime.","Your treatment plan will depend on your type and stage of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Possible treatments include:

• Chemotherapy
• Immunotherapy (medicine designed to boost your immune system to fight cancer)
• Targeted therapy (medicine directed toward your genes and proteins)
• Radiation
• Stem cell transplant

A non-substance addiction includes things such as gambling, risky sex, pornography, food, the internet, mobile devices, and shopping. These are sometimes called behavioral addictions. When a person does these things in excess and can’t stop, it becomes an addiction. All addictions can interfere with your work and personal life. It can even place you in unsafe situations. It can result in physical, emotional, and financial harm. Some can lead to other disorders and substance addictions. This includes depression, alcohol, drugs, and suicide.","A person with a non-substance addiction is unable to stop doing the activity or behavior. For example, a person addicted to gambling may spend all their savings. Non-substance addiction symptoms can include:

• Compulsive, excessive, and repetitive engagement in a risky behavior or activity
• Being unable to stop the activity
• Impaired judgment
• Being unable to control the behavior
• Craving the activity or behavior
• Being unable to recognize the consequences of the behavior (safety, financial, emotional, physical)
• Strained work and personal relationships
• Inappropriate emotional response","Addiction is a chronic disorder of a person’s brain activity. Simply put, your brain is wired that way. Doctors can’t say why certain people can’t control behavior. But the behavior combines reward, motivation, and memory in an unhealthy way. This triggers physical, emotional, and social responses. Doctors believe the behavior provides a rush or a thrill. For example, people addicted to gambling may experience a rush when winning or losing money. A person’s experiences and personality type play a part in addiction.",Some people with a non-substance addiction recognize the problem and seek help. Some people are told by family and friends. A mental health professional can diagnose the addiction.,"Non-substance addiction cannot be prevented or avoided. However, once you have been diagnosed, your mental health professional will help you find ways to avoid your exposure to triggers.","Treatment is possible. First, you must admit you have an addiction. Talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a mental health expert for more help. This help may involve cognitive behavioral therapy. This is talk therapy. It involves talking with your mental health professional about your addiction. It also may include advice about how to understand your addiction urges and how to handle them. Treatment for a non-substance addiction may also include treatment for depression or substance abuse, if needed. Support groups can also be help in addressing addiction.","It’s okay to tell trusted family and friends that you have a non-substance addiction. This is important if you’re trying to avoid triggers. For example, if you are addicted to gambling, don’t go to a casino with friends. If you are addicted to shopping and want to join friends, you might leave your credit cards and cash at home.

291,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease),https://familydoctor.org/condition/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is a buildup of fat in the liver. It is a common condition. MASLD can be harmless, but sometimes it may cause the liver to swell. Over time, this swelling can cause scarring in your liver (cirrhosis). The more scarring your liver has, the worse it functions.","Many people do not have any symptoms of MASLD. If you have MASLD, you may feel fullness or pain in the middle or upper right side of the abdomen. You may feel extremely tired. Your belly may be swollen. You may have yellowing of your skin and eyes.

If your MASLD has progressed to cirrhosis, you may have more serious symptoms including fluid retention, internal bleeding, and mental confusion.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes MASLD. They do know that MASLD is linked to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is when your body doesn’t respond well to insulin. This makes it more difficult for your body to regulate blood sugar.

It is not caused by drinking alcohol.","To diagnose MASLD, your doctor may check your blood and order a scan of your liver. If your doctor thinks you may have a more severe liver disease, you may need a liver biopsy. In this procedure, your doctor inserts a needle through your skin and removes a small piece of tissue from your liver. This tissue is looked at under a microscope to check for signs of severe liver disease.","A wide range of things can increase your risk of MASLD, including certain medicines and genetic disorders. The most common risk factors for MASLD are obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels.","People who have MASLD usually do not need treatment. The most important thing is to focus on what has caused your MASLD. Losing weight gradually (1 to 2 pounds per week) may reduce the amount of fat in your liver. However, losing weight quickly may make MASLD worse. Ask your doctor for advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way. If your cholesterol and blood sugar levels are high, your doctor may give you medicine to lower them. If a medicine you take is causing your MASLD, your doctor may consider switching you to a different medicine.

There are some oral (taken by mouth) medicines that may help with MASLD. However, there is limited success without addressing obesity and weight loss.","For most people, MASLD is harmless and does not cause serious health problems. MASLD usually does not affect how well the liver works. However, in rare cases, MASLD may stop the liver from working as it should. Although rare, liver transplants have increased significantly in recent years as a result of MASLD. No one can tell for sure who will have liver problems from MASLD. It is more likely to happen in people who have diabetes or who are very overweight.","• What is the best treatment for me?

292,Nosebleeds,https://familydoctor.org/condition/nosebleeds/,"A nosebleed is blood loss from the tissue that lines your nose. It can affect both nostrils, but most often occurs in only one nostril. Usually, a nosebleed is not serious.

The nose has many blood vessels in it to help warm and humidify the air you breathe. These vessels lie close to the surface, making them easy to injure — which can cause a nosebleed. Sometimes, though, nosebleeds are more serious. These stem from large vessels in the back of the nose. Nosebleeds from these larger vessels often occur after an injury, in young children, or in the elderly. Usually, the older the patient, the more serious the nosebleed.","Most often, you will have no other symptoms other than the nosebleed itself.","Two of the most common causes of nosebleeds are dryness (often caused by indoor heat in the winter) and nose picking. These 2 things work together — nose picking occurs more often when mucus in the nose is dry and crusty. Colds also can cause nosebleeds.

Less common causes include injuries, allergies, or the use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine. Children may stick small objects up their noses, and that can cause the nose to bleed. Older people may have atherosclerosis (which is the hardening of the arteries), infections, high blood pressure, or blood clotting disorders that may cause nosebleeds. Nosebleeds may occur and last longer if you’re taking drugs that interfere with blood clotting, such as aspirin. A rare cause of frequent nosebleeds is a disorder called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Sometimes, the cause of nosebleeds can’t be determined.

Frequent nosebleeds may mean you have a more serious problem. For example, nosebleeds and bruising can be early signs of leukemia. Nosebleeds can also be a sign of a blood clotting or blood vessel disorder, or a nasal tumor (both non-cancerous and cancerous).","There is usually no need to formally diagnose a nosebleed. If your nose is bleeding, it’s fairly self-evident.","Tips for preventing nosebleeds:

• Keep children’s fingernails short to limit nose injury and to discourage nose picking.
• Counteract the drying effects of indoor heated air by using a humidifier at night in your bedroom.
• Quit smoking. Smoking dries out your nose and also irritates it.
• Open your mouth when you sneeze.","A nosebleed can be scary to get — or see — but try to stay calm. Most nosebleeds look much worse than they really are. Almost all nosebleeds can be treated at home.

If you get a nosebleed, sit down and lean slightly forward. Keeping your head above your heart will slow the bleeding. Lean forward so the blood will drain out of your nose instead of down the back of your throat. If you lean back, you may swallow the blood. This can irritate your stomach.

Use your thumb and index finger to squeeze together the soft portion of your nose. This area is located between the end of your nose and the hard, bony ridge that forms the bridge of your nose. Keep holding your nose until the bleeding stops. Don’t let go for at least 5 minutes. If it’s still bleeding, hold it again for another 5 to 10 minutes.

Once the bleeding stops, wait a few hours before doing anything that might make it start again, such as bending over or blowing your nose.","Nosebleeds can be a nuisance. They come on suddenly, often with no warning. They usually aren’t harmful.","• I get a lot of nosebleeds. What can I do to stop them?
• How long should I wait to call the doctor if I’m having a nosebleed?
• I’m around secondhand smoke a lot. Could that be causing my nosebleeds?
• Are nosebleeds more common in winter?
• What can I do to prevent my child from picking his/her nose?
• Could my nosebleeds be a sign of something more serious?

• The bleeding was caused by an injury, such as a fall or something hitting your face. In some cases, this may be a sign of internal bleeding.
• The amount of blood makes it hard to breathe.
• A child under 2 has a nosebleed.
• You’re taking a blood thinning medicine.
• You get nosebleeds weekly.

Your doctor will try to find out where the bleeding is coming from in your nose. He or she will probably ask you some questions and examine your nose. If the bleeding doesn’t stop on its own or when pressure is applied, your doctor may cauterize the bleeding vessel or pack your nose to stop the bleeding. Cauterization involves using a special solution called silver nitrate or an electrical or heating device to burn the vessel so that it stops bleeding. Your doctor will numb your nose before the procedure. Packing the nose involves putting special gauze or an inflatable latex balloon into the nose so that enough pressure is placed on the vessel to make it stop bleeding"
293,Obesity,https://familydoctor.org/condition/obesity/,"Obesity is a complex and increasingly common disease that is associated with many health risks such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, and even death. Maintaining a normal weight is one of the best ways to prevent many serious health problems. When you have obesity, your body weight is too high for your height, often due to excess body fat. Obesity can develop at any age and is considered a chronic (long-term) condition.","You may be diagnosed with obesity if your body mass index (BMI) is at or above 30kg/m2. BMI is a measure of your weight relative to your height and functions as a rough estimate of body fat. An elevated BMI or diagnosis of obesity can also lead to other serious health conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, arthritis) that have symptoms of their own. Although a high BMI does increase your risk of other health complications, BMI by itself is not a very good indicator of overall health.","Obesity risk is complicated by factors such as genetics, hormones, lifestyle, and environment. Certainly, eating more calories than your body can use can cause your body to store extra fat, which can increase your risk of obesity. But for many people, this outdated explanation of obesity as the result of individual choices or poor diet alone just isn’t accurate. Current evidence suggests your risk of obesity is determined by a complex combination of factors.

Some individual and environmental factors that increase your risk of obesity include:

• Poor sleeping habits
• Quitting smoking
• Stress
• Availability of fresh, healthy food
• Availability of safe exercise options
• Safe home life
• Access to medical care

Some medicines and medical conditions may make it more challenging to maintain a healthy body weight or to lose weight. Medicines include:

• Antihistamines, alpha blockers (given for allergies)
• Corticosteroids/steroids (given to reduce inflammation or to treat some chronic conditions)
• Beta blockers, methyldopa (given for high blood pressure)
• Insulin, sulfonylureas (given for diabetes)
• Lithium (given for manic-depressive illness)
• Neuroleptics (given for schizophrenia)
• Progestins (given for endometriosis)
• Tricyclic antidepressants (given for depression)
• Valproate (given for epilepsy)

Obesity can sometimes be associated with other medical conditions, or may lead to certain medical conditions, including:

• Hormonal disorders: Polycystic ovary syndrome Cushing’s disease Diabetes Hypothyroidism
• Polycystic ovary syndrome
• Cushing’s disease
• Diabetes
• Hypothyroidism

• Polycystic ovary syndrome
• Cushing’s disease
• Diabetes
• Hypothyroidism

• Cardiovascular disorders: Congestive heart failure Idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle) Heart valve disorders
• Congestive heart failure
• Idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle)
• Heart valve disorders

• Congestive heart failure
• Idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle)
• Heart valve disorders

• Sleep disorders: Sleep apnea Upper airway resistance syndrome (blockage of airways during sleep)
• Sleep apnea
• Upper airway resistance syndrome (blockage of airways during sleep)

• Sleep apnea
• Upper airway resistance syndrome (blockage of airways during sleep)

Talk to your doctor if you think you have or have had any of the conditions above or take the medicines listed above. In some cases, specific treatments for your medical condition or a change in medicines can make a difference in your efforts to manage your weight.","Obesity is most often diagnosed using your BMI. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is in the ‘overweight’ range, and obesity is diagnosed when BMI is 30 and above. However, because BMI only estimates body fat by your height and weight, BMI by itself isn’t a perfect tool for diagnosing obesity. For example, people who are very muscular could have a BMI that indicates obesity – even if body fat is normal or low. On the other hand, BMI may suggest that obesity is absent when body fat is actually high. This happens most commonly in older adults.

The measurement around your waist (sometimes called a waist circumference) is also commonly used to diagnose obesity. Although waist measurement is also not a perfect tool for diagnosing obesity, having a lot of body fat around your waist is tied to a number of health issues. You can measure your waist by wrapping a measuring tape around your waist (closest to your belly button). For most women, a waist measurement of 35 inches or more could put you at higher risk. For most men, that number is 40 inches.

If you think you might have obesity, talk to your doctor about health complications and other factors that may be involved. Your doctor can also work with you to find treatment options that are right for you.","Obesity is caused by a complex combination of factors, including hormones, genetics, and even your environment. Unfortunately, many risk factors for obesity – such as your age and family history – are out of your control. However, some lifestyle factors like healthy eating, exercise, and good sleep habits also play an important role. Talk to your doctor about the importance of maintaining a healthy body weight to prevent obesity and preventing complications if you are diagnosed.

Lifestyle treatments range from self-help and commercial weight loss programs to professional dietary counseling, physical activity training, and behavior therapy. Start small and set realistic goals. Even small changes can make a surprising difference in your health. There are also many online tools and mobile apps that might be helpful for setting and keeping lifestyle goals. Your doctor can provide advice and referrals.

If lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough to help you meet your treatment goals, your doctor may talk to you about adding anti-obesity medicines. These medicines should be used in addition to healthy eating and exercise. Most available anti-obesity medications are approved for long-term use to help you reduce body fat and keep it off. Obesity is a chronic (long-term) condition. Anti-obesity medicines can help control symptoms like excess body fat and elevated BMI, but they won’t cure obesity. Stopping these medicines can lead to a return of symptoms.","Obesity is a complex chronic health condition that is best treated with the help of your family doctor. Treating obesity is about preventing health complications and improving the symptoms of obesity by reducing body fat – it’s not about getting to a specific number on the scale.

You and your doctor can work together to decide what your treatment goals are and how to achieve them. Treatment options for obesity generally include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery.

Surgical treatment may be an option for people with severe obesity. Surgery for obesity (called metabolic and bariatric surgery) can help patients lose a large amount of weight and can reverse some complications of obesity. Although some weight regain is common after surgery, the effect of this treatment option is often permanent. The two most common metabolic and bariatric surgeries both involve creating less room for food and changing your body’s hormonal response to food. Both surgeries are usually minimally invasive and performed using very small incisions (laparoscopically):

• Gastric sleeve (also called vertical sleeve gastrectomy) is the most common bariatric procedure in the US. In this surgery, a “sleeve” is created that runs down the side of the stomach from the esophagus (where the food enters) to the intestine (where the food leaves).
• Gastric bypass (also called Roux-en-Y) was the most common bariatric procedure in the US until about 10 years ago. In this surgery, a small pouch is created at the top of the stomach and then attached to the small intestine. In this way, food “bypasses” the rest of the stomach when it is eaten.

• Your doctor can explain the different procedures, risks, and help you decide if surgical treatment is right for you.

Losing weight is an important part of obesity management, but it’s not the only part. Weight loss maintenance (keeping weight off) is also a goal. Like other chronic diseases, obesity requires long-term treatment, likely using a combination of these different treatment options (lifestyle, medication, surgery). Obesity is not something you need to manage alone. Your family doctor is there to support you in setting and achieving your treatment goals.","Obesity can affect many other aspects of your overall health. People with obesity are at risk of several complications, including:

• Cancer
• Coronary artery disease
• Depression
• Gallbladder disease
• Gynecological problems, such as infertility
• Heart failure
• High blood pressure
• High cholesterol
• Metabolic syndrome
• Liver disease
• Sleep apnea
• Stroke
• Type 2 diabetes","• I have tried everything to lose weight. Why isn’t it working?

294,Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,https://familydoctor.org/condition/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is mental health disorder, such as anxiety disorder or depression. It causes unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). We all have habits and routines in our daily lives, such as brushing our teeth before bed. However, for people with OCD, excessive repetitive behavior gets in the way of their daily lives.

Most people with OCD know that their obsessions and compulsions make no sense. Yet, they can’t ignore or stop them.

Obsessions are ideas, images, and impulses that run through the person’s mind over and over again. A person with OCD doesn’t want to have these thoughts and finds them bothersome. Despite this, they can’t control them. Sometimes these thoughts occur occasionally and are mildly annoying. Other times, a person who has OCD will have obsessive thoughts all the time.

Obsessive thoughts cause people who have OCD to feel nervous and afraid. They try to get rid of these feelings by performing certain behaviors that follow “rules” or “steps” that they make up for themselves. These behaviors are called compulsions. Compulsive behaviors are sometimes also called rituals. For example, a person who has OCD may have obsessive thoughts about germs. As such, the person may wash their hands repeatedly even if they are already clean.

Performing these behaviors usually makes the nervous feelings go away for a short time. When the fear and nervousness return, the person who has OCD repeats the routine all over again.

The following are some common obsessions:

• Fear of dirt or germs
• Disgust with bodily waste or fluids
• Concern with order, symmetry (balance), and exactness
• Worry that a task has been done poorly, even when the person knows this is not true
• Fear of thinking evil or sinful thoughts
• Thinking about certain sounds, images, words, or numbers all the time
• Need for constant reassurance
• Fear of harming a family member or friend

The following are some common compulsions:

• Cleaning and grooming, such as washing hands, showering, or brushing teeth over and over again
• Checking drawers, door locks, and appliances to be sure they are shut, locked, or turned off
• Repeating actions, such as going in and out of a door, sitting down and getting up from a chair, or touching certain objects several times
• Ordering and rearranging items in certain ways
• Counting to a certain number, over and over
• Saving newspapers, mail, or containers when they are no longer needed
• Seeking constant reassurance and approval","For many years, OCD was thought to be rare. Some recent studies show that it is more common than once thought. OCD affects men and women equally.","No one has found a single, proven cause for OCD. Some research shows that it may have to do with chemicals in the brain that carry messages from one nerve cell to another. One of these chemicals is called serotonin. It helps to keep people from repeating the same behaviors over and over again. A person who has OCD may not have enough serotonin.

Many people who have OCD can function better when they take medicines that increase the amount of serotonin in their brain. OCD tends to run in families. Symptoms often begin in children or teens.","If you believe that you have OCD, you should see your family doctor. They can help diagnose and begin treatment for OCD. Your family doctor may also arrange for you to see other mental health professionals such as a counselor or psychiatrist. Sometimes OCD can be confused with other disorders and your family doctor, with the other members of your healthcare team, can help make an early and accurate diagnosis.

An OCD diagnosis will be based on your symptoms. This includes your behavior, your obsessions and/or your compulsions. A mental health care professional will also consider how these affect or interfere with your daily life.","You cannot prevent OCD from starting. And once you have OCD, you will always have it. OCD is a chronic condition. But you can prevent the symptoms of OCD by following your treatment plan. You should also take any OCD medications exactly as they are prescribed. You should do this even if you are feeling better.","Combining therapy with medication is usually considered the most effective way to treat OCD.

Several medicines are available to treat OCD. These medicines are also often used to treat depression and anxiety and include:

• Clomipramine
• Fluoxetine
• Sertraline
• Paroxetine
• Fluvoxamine

These drugs can cause side effects such as dry mouth, nausea, and drowsiness. Sometimes they also have sexual side effects. It may be several weeks before you see an improvement in your behavior.

Under the guidance of a trained therapist, behavioral therapy can also be used to treat OCD. In behavioral therapy, people face situations that cause or trigger their obsessions and anxiety. Then they are encouraged not to perform the rituals that usually help control their nervous feelings. For example, a person who is obsessed with germs might be encouraged to use a public toilet. After doing this, they would be asked to limit hand-washing to one time. To use this method, a person who has OCD must be able to tolerate the high levels of anxiety that can result from the experience.","People who have OCD often have other kinds of anxiety. These can include phobias (such as fear of spiders or fear of flying) or panic attacks.

People who have OCD also may have:

• Depression
• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
• Eating disorder
• Learning disorder

Having one or more of these disorders can make diagnosis and treatment more difficult. So it’s important to talk to your family doctor about any symptoms you have, even if you’re embarrassed.","• What is the best treatment for me?
• Should I go into therapy?
• Should I see a psychiatrist or psychologist?
• Am I more likely to have depression or other mental health issues?
• How can I best deal with my compulsions?
• Will a medicine help?
• Will I have to take medicine and be in therapy the rest of my life?
• Is there anything I can do to help myself at home?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Children

295,Occupational Respiratory Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/occupational-respiratory-disease/,"Occupational respiratory disease is any lung condition you get at work. It occurs because of repeated exposure to certain toxins. You can even get a disease long after being exposed to those toxins.

Certain workplaces lend themselves to disease. The most common are coalmines and factories or areas with high amounts of toxins. These include asbestos and silica dust, as well as smoke, fumes, gases, and other particles.

Types of occupational respiratory disease include:

• Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, also known as Black Lung Disease.
• Asbestosis.
• Silicosis.
• Farmers’ lung, also known as allergic alveolitis.

It also includes forms of asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema.","The symptoms of occupational respiratory disease vary. They depend on your work setting, type of disease, and state of health. Smoking can worsen your symptoms.

Symptoms can be similar to those of a cold, the flu, or allergies, such as:

• dry, scratchy, or sore throat
• runny nose
• cough
• fever
• tight chest
• chest pain
• muscle or body aches
• breathing problems, such as shortness of breath or abnormal breathing

Contact your doctor if symptoms persist and seem to occur at work. It may help to keep a log of your symptoms.","Many substances found in the workplace can cause disease. This occurs when the toxins irritate the lining in your lungs. Common causes include:

• Dustfrom things such as wood, cotton, coal, asbestos, silica, and talc. Pesticides, drug or enzyme powders, and fiberglass also can hurt your lungs. Even cereal grains, coffee particles, and food flavorings used to make microwave popcorn can cause damage.
• Fumesfrom metals that are heated and cooled quickly. This process results in fine, solid particles being carried in the air. Job examples include welding, smelting, furnace work, pottery making, plastics manufacturing, and rubber operations.
• Smokefrom burning materials. Smoke can contain a variety of particles, gases, and vapors. Firefighters are at an increased risk.
• Gasessuch as formaldehyde, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. These are found at jobs with high heat operations, such as welding, brazing, smelting, oven drying, and furnace work. You also are at risk if you work in a lab using chemicals.
• Vaporsare a form of gas given off by all liquids. Vapors usually irritate your nose and throat before they affect the lungs.
• Mists or spraysfrom paints, lacquers (such as varnish), hair spray, pesticides, cleaning products, acids, oils, and solvents (such as turpentine).","Talk to your doctor if you think you have occupational respiratory disease. They will review your symptoms and ask questions, such as:

• When did your symptoms first appear?
• How often do you have symptoms?
• What time of day are your symptoms worse?
• What type of materials do you come into contact with at work?
• Do you feel worse when you’re at work?

Your doctor also will ask about your work setting and exposure. It may help to have the following information.

• A record of symptoms, including the day, time, and duration.
• A list of previous jobs, hobbies, and smoking habits, if any.
• Completed occupational health history forms.
• A list of precautions and measures in your workplace.
• Your employer’s material safety data sheets (MSDSs). These are information sheets about the products used in your workplace. All employers are required by law to complete and provide these forms.

Tests can diagnose occupational respiratory disease. Your doctor may order a breathing test to listen to your lungs and see how they perform. A chest X-ray or CT scan can detect masses, fluid, or inflammation in your lungs. Your doctor may do in-depth testing to determine the type of disease and severity. This can include a bronchoscopy, biopsy, or surgery.","Depending on your line of work, you might not be able to avoid occupational respiratory disease. You can try to limit exposure to reduce your risk of disease. Things you can do are:

• Stop smoking.
• Wear a mask.
• Increase ventilation in work area.
• Use a respirator. This is a device that covers your nose and mouth. It cleans the air before it enters your body. You should clean the respirator after each use.
• Know and follow workplace safety precautions and first-aid processes.

Workplaces should have programs in place to monitor and limit exposure.","There is no cure for occupational respiratory disease. Treatment can help reduce symptoms and prevent further damage. It also can help improve your quality of life. Treatment types vary and can include use of medicines, inhalers, and/or oxygen. Severe conditions may require a lung transplant.","Talk to your employer if you are diagnosed. They may need to create new measures to reduce or remove your exposure. A change in elements, machines, or work processes can lessen toxins in the air. You may have to change jobs altogether.

If your case is mild, you should be able to lead a normal life. Your doctor can help you manage your condition. They will talk to you about routine testing and vaccines, such as the flu shot. You should avoid smoking and secondhand smoke. Try to maintain a healthy weight. If you have trouble breathing when you exercise, you may need pulmonary rehabilitation.

Occupational respiratory disease can lead to lung cancer and other diseases. People exposed to asbestos are at risk of mesothelioma. People exposed to silica dust are at risk of tuberculosis.","• What should I do if I think something at work is making me sick?
• Will occupational respiratory disease affect my life expectancy?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Respiratory Health at Work

296,Opioid Addiction,https://familydoctor.org/condition/opioid-addiction/,"An addiction is a strong craving to do something. In this case, it’s a strong craving to use opioids. Addiction is a disease that affects your brain and behavior. At first, you should have control over your choice to use opioids. However, opioids are very addictive. Over time, their effect can make you want to keep using the medicine or use it incorrectly. This can lead to changes in brain function that cause you to develop a powerful urge to take opioids.

An opioid addiction is an unhealthy dependence on these powerful medicines. Opioids are a class of drugs that are made with natural or synthetic chemicals found in the opium poppy plant. This includes illegal substances, such as heroin, and prescription drugs intended to help relieve pain. Opioids also relax the body and produce a “high.”

Doctors typically prescribe opioids in instances such as:

• Toothaches and dental procedures
• Injuries
• Surgeries
• Chronic conditions, such as cancer

Types of opioid drugs include:

• Opium
• Heroin
• Codeine
• Fentanyl
• Hydrocodone and oxycodone
• Hydromorphone and oxymorphone
• Methadone
• Morphine
• Tramadol

Some prescription cough medicines also contain opioids.","An opioid addiction is considered a form of substance abuse. The signs and symptoms of substance abuse can be physical, behavioral, and psychological. One clear sign of addiction is not being able to stop using opioids. This may look like using the medicine more frequently than your doctor prescribed, using a higher dose than prescribed, or using someone else’s prescription for yourself. Another sign of addiction is seeking the immediate rewards (the “high”) of the drug despite knowing the consequences.

Common symptoms of opioid addiction include:

• Physical agitation
• Confusion
• Depression or anxiety
• Nausea
• Constipation
• Shallow or slow breathing

Ongoing slowed breathing can lead to a condition called hypoxia. This occurs when not enough oxygen reaches your brain. Hypoxia can lead to permanent brain damage, coma, or death.

If you take too many opioids, you may experience an opioid overdose. Even a small amount can be too much for some people and lead to an overdose. An overdose is a very serious medical condition. Symptoms can include:

• Vomiting
• Loss of consciousness (passing out)
• Unresponsiveness (can’t wake up)
• Slow, irregular breathing, or not breathing at all
• Slow, erratic pulse, or no pulse

An opioid overdose requires immediate medical treatment. Call 9-1-1 right away if you think someone has overdosed. In some states, a prescription nasal spray called naloxone (Narcan) is available to keep on hand in case of an overdose. Talk to your doctor to see if you might need this medicine for emergency reasons.","Opioid drugs alter your brain by creating artificial endorphins. These block pain and change how your brain responds to pain. The false endorphins can even produce a high or feelings of euphoria. Opioid use can cause your brain to depend on these endorphins, or even to stop producing its own endorphins. The longer you use opioids, the more likely this is to happen.

Drug tolerance occurs when your body gets used to the effects of a drug over time. As this happens, you may need to take a higher dose of the drug to get the same effect.

Drug dependence occurs when your body changes and starts to rely on a drug to function. These changes often lead to withdrawal symptoms when you stop using the drug. Withdrawal symptoms can be mild or severe, and may include:

• Sweating
• Nausea or vomiting
• Chills
• Diarrhea
• Shaking
• Depression
• Insomnia
• Fatigue

You should always talk to your doctor before you stop using a drug, even an opioid. They can help you reduce or prevent withdrawal symptoms by gradually lowering your dose over time until you no longer need the medicine.

What is the difference between drug tolerance, dependence, and addiction?

Drug tolerance and dependence are a result of taking any opioid drug for a long time. You can be tolerant to or dependent on a drug, but not yet be addicted to it.

Drug addiction is a disease for which help and treatment options are available. When you become addicted to a drug, it might seem like your body and mind can’t function without the drug. Addiction can cause you to obsessively seek out the drug, even when the drug use causes health, behavior, or relationship problems.

How is opioid addiction diagnosed?

Your doctor or a medical health professional can diagnose opioid addiction or opioid use disorder. Diagnosis will involve a medical assessment. It may also include certain lab tests or mental health tests.

You might have an opioid addiction if you crave the drug or if you feel you can’t control the urge to take the drug. You may also be addicted if you keep using the drug without your doctor’s consent, even if the drug is harmful for you. Opioid addiction can lead to problems in daily life, such as trouble with health, money, work or school, the law, or your relationships with family or friends. Those close to you may become aware of your addiction before you do.

Can opioid addiction be prevented or avoided?

Opioid medicines can be safe when used correctly. However, opioid drugs have a high risk for addiction, especially when used for a long time. People can also become addicted if they misuse the medicine (opioid use disorder) or use the drug illegally.

In general, you are more likely to avoid addiction if you use opioid drugs no longer than a week. Research shows that using them for more than a month can make you dependent on them.","How is opioid addiction diagnosed.

Research shows that using them for more than a month can make you dependent on them.","Opioid addiction is a chronic illness and should be treated the same as other chronic illnesses. It should be managed and monitored by medical professionals who are properly trained to treat the condition.

Treatment for opioid addiction is different for each person. The main goal of treatment is to help you stop using the drug. Treatment will also help you recover and hopefully prevent you from using the drug again in the future.

When you stop using opioids, you will experience a period of withdrawal. You will likely have symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, chills and fever, fatigue, and depression or anxiety. It is normal—although hard—to have these symptoms as your body recovers from the effects of the drug and lessens its tolerance and dependence on the drug.

Your doctor may prescribe certain medicines to help relieve your withdrawal symptoms and control your drug cravings. These medicines include methadone (often used to treat heroin addiction), buprenorphine, and naltrexone.

Methadone and buprenorphine help reduce withdrawal symptoms by targeting the same centers in the brain that opioids target. However, these medicines will not make you feel high. They help restore balance to your brain and allow it to heal. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), you may safely take the medicines long-term, even for life. You should not quit taking them without first talking to your doctor.

Naltrexone is another medicine your doctor may prescribe. This medicine doesn’t help you stop taking opioids. It is meant to prevent you from relapsing or taking opioids again. This medicine is different from methadone and buprenorphine because it does not directly prevent cravings or withdrawal. Instead, according to the NIH, it prevents you from feeling the high you get when taking opioids.

Along with opioid addiction treatment, you may also need help with your mental or emotional health. Behavioral treatments can help you learn how to manage depression or anxiety. They can also help you cope with avoiding opioids, dealing with cravings, and healing damaged relationships. Some behavioral treatments include individual counseling, group or family counseling, and cognitive therapy. Ask your doctor for a recommendation.

• Commit to quitting. Take control of your behavior and commit to ending the cycle of opioid use.
• Get help from your doctor. They can be your biggest ally, even if you’re trying to quit a drug they prescribed. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medicine that will help ease your cravings for the addictive drug. Talking with your doctor or a counselor about your problems and drug use can be helpful, too.

297,Oppositional Defiant Disorder,https://familydoctor.org/condition/oppositional-defiant-disorder/,"Oppositional defiant disorder, or ODD, is a behavior condition that affects children and teens. Those who have it are angry, argumentative, and defiant much more often than others in their age group. The behaviors associated with ODD have a negative effect on the child’s or teen’s relationships and ability to do well in school and at home.","Every child or teen gets angry, throws tantrums, and argues. But it can be hard to tell if a child or teen is just acting out, or if they have ODD. The symptoms of ODD are disruptive to home and family life. They’re almost constant and last for at least 6 months. Symptoms of ODD may include:

• Frequent temper tantrums
• Constant arguing with or defying adults
• Refusing to follow rules
• Annoying other people on purpose
• Blaming others for their own mistakes or bad behavior
• Acting easily annoyed by others
• Feelings of anger and resentment toward other people
• Wanting to get revenge on others
• Problems at school
• Trouble making or keeping friends",Doctors don’t know the exact cause of ODD. It may result from a combination of factors. The child’s general attitude and how the family reacts to his or her behavior may play a role in it. ODD may run in families. Other causes may be related to the nervous system or to brain chemicals that are out of balance.,"Your doctor will ask about your child’s symptoms, medical history, family history, and other emotional or behavioral problems. Your doctor may want to refer your child to a doctor specializing in behavior problems for a more in-depth evaluation.","A child is more likely to develop ODD if they have the following risk factors:

• A history of abuse or neglect
• A parent or caretaker who has a mood disorder, or who abuses alcohol or drugs
• Exposure to violence
• Inconsistent discipline
• Lack of supervision
• Instability in the family, such as divorce, multiple moves, and changing schools frequently
• Financial problems in the family
• Parents who have or have had ODD, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or behavioral problems","There are several treatment options for ODD. Some focus only on the child, while other treatments include the child’s family and school.

Your doctor will probably work with another doctor who specializes in mental health to treat your child. This other doctor will likely be a psychologist or counselor. Treatment will focus on helping your child learn better ways to manage his or her anger. It will also help your child learn how to handle social situations so they will feel less frustrated with other people.

Treatment can also help families learn to communicate better with each other. Your doctor also can help you learn how to manage your child’s behavior and how to use discipline effectively.

In a treatment called cognitive behavior therapy, children and their families learn problem-solving skills and how to feel more positive.","You may feel helpless if your child or teen has ODD. You may feel disconnected, even if you’re participating in his or her therapy. But there are many ways to actively help your child at home. The following can help encourage good behavior:

• Praise your child’s positive or good behaviors.
• Be consistent about rules.
• Model the behaviors you want your child to follow.
• Establish a daily routine for your child.
• Spend quality time with your child.","• Does my child have ODD?

298,Oral Thrush | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/thrush/,Thrush is a yeast infection. It occurs on your tongue and the lining of your mouth. It can occur in both newborns and adults with certain health conditions.,"For newborns, the signs of thrush include:

• White, creamy patches on their tongue or in their mouth.
• Red or dry mouth.
• Trouble nursing, due to mouth pain.
• Diaper rash (rarely).
• Fussy mood.
• On the nursing mother, symptoms of a yeast infection include cracked, red, itchy, sore, or tender nipples.

For adults, the main symptom of thrush is the sores, or patches. These can bleed if you scrape them or when you brush your teeth. You also may have pain when swallowing.

Although everyone has germs in their mouth, your immune system works to regulate them. You can have too much Candida. Having too much of this fungus causes the oral thrush infection.

Thrush is most common in newborns because their immune systems are still developing. Newborns also can sometimes have thrush at birth if their mother had a vaginal yeast infection at the time of delivery.

Children and adults can get thrush too. Your risk of thrush increases if you:

• Are in poor health.
• Have a weak immune system.
• Have HIV or AIDS.
• Have chemotherapy treatment.
• Have had an organ transplant.
• Have diabetes.
• Take several antibiotics (too much can kill the good bacteria that helps regulate candida).
• Take steroid medicine (some inhalers for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, contain steroids).
• Take other medicines that dry the mouth.
• Wear ill-fitting dentures.
• Are a smoker.","Thrush is easy for a doctor to diagnose. He or she will look at your tongue and mouth to check for sores. The doctor may scrape one of the sores to get a sample to examine. If you have sores in your throat, your doctor may do a throat culture to examine the fungus.","You can help prevent thrush by practicing good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth, and floss every day. If you use an inhaler, rinse your mouth out after each use. People who have diabetes need to monitor their blood sugar. When your blood sugar is high, extra sugar collects in your saliva and fuels candida. If you are at risk of getting thrush or have chronic thrush, talk to your doctor about ways to manage the condition.

You cannot avoid newborns from getting thrush, but you can help lower their risk.

• Clean and disinfect all bottle and feeding parts after each use.
• Clean and disinfect pacifiers and toys that babies put in their mouths.
• Change your baby’s diapers often. This can prevent yeast infections and diaper rashes.
• If you have a yeast infection on your nipples while breastfeeding, talk to your doctor and get treatment.
• If you have a vaginal yeast infection during pregnancy, talk to your doctor and get treatment.","Your doctor will decide if you have a mild or severe case of thrush. Even mild cases should be treated by your doctor. After treatment, you can try to prevent getting thrush again by eating yogurt and taking acidophilus pills. These pills are sold over the counter. They help balance the good and bad germs in your mouth. Replace your toothbrush to avoid bad germs. If you have diabetes, you’ll need to lower your blood sugar level.

Severe cases require prescription antifungal treatment, such as:

• medicine (in either pill or liquid form)
• mouthwash
• lozenges

The same is true for newborns. Mild cases of thrush may resolve on their own, but your doctor will help you decide if that’s an option in your case. If you have a yeast infection on your nipples while breastfeeding, you also will need treatment. The doctor can prescribe an antifungal cream to apply. If you don’t treat the infection, you can continue to pass it to your baby. Most cases of newborn thrush are treated with prescription antifungal medicine. Often, these are drops that you apply to your baby’s tongue and mouth.","For most people, oral thrush goes away with treatment. However, it is possible to get chronic, or recurring, thrush. This is more common if you have a weak immune system or related health issue. Talk to your doctor about how to manage thrush. You may need to take an ongoing antifungal medicine.

If thrush is left untreated, the fungus candida can sometimes spread. It can cause infection in your:

• eyes (endophthalmitis)
• brain (meningitis)
• heart (endocarditis)
• joints (arthritis)","• How dangerous is thrush?

299,Organic Acid Metabolism Disorders,https://familydoctor.org/condition/organic-acid-metabolism-disorders/,Organic acid metabolism disorders are a group of rare birth defects. They affect your ability to break down food into energy. Another name for them is organic acidemia metabolic disorders. There are numerous types of the disorder. They occur when a newborn lacks a certain protein or has a protein that doesn’t work correctly.,"Symptoms may begin right after birth or a few days later. Some babies never have symptoms or don’t have any until they are older. Each type of disorder has different symptoms based on the protein it affects. Common signs of a disorder are:

• Dehydration (Dry mouth and lips, rapid heartbeat, or confusion)
• Drowsiness or lack of energy
• Fussiness
• Trouble eating and gaining weight
• Vomiting or diarrhea
• Low blood sugar
• Low body temperature
• High levels of acid in body fluids
• Skin rash
• Infection
• Weakened muscles, spasms, or seizures",These types of disorders are genetic. Parents may carry the recessive gene even if it’s not active. There is a chance parents can pass it to their children.,"A doctor often diagnoses the disorders during your baby’s routine newborn screening test. This is a heel prick test to collect a blood sample. All babies have the test within 24 to 48 hours of birth before leaving the hospital. The screening checks for a range of birth defects and rare conditions. Ask your doctor or hospital which metabolic disorders they screen for.

If your baby tests positive for a disorder, the doctor will perform other tests to confirm the diagnosis.","Since the disorders are caused by genetics, you cannot prevent them. If you know you have one of the disorders, there is a risk of passing it to your offspring. You might not know you carry the gene, if it is recessive. The only way to find out is to get genetic testing done before or during pregnancy.

Organic acid metabolism disorders treatment

Early diagnosis is key to treatment. Newborns who have a disorder are at risk of death if it is not detected. Treatment should begin right away with nutrition changes. You will have to switch your baby to a low-protein diet. This helps manage acid levels and the breakdown of food. Some disorders require taking dietary supplements.",null,"There is no cure for the rare disorders. If you have a disorder, you will need to maintain the specialized diet for life. Your child’s doctor, as well as a geneticist and nutritionist, can help monitor the condition.

The risk of death decreases as your baby gets older. However, severe problems can occur if they don’t get treatment, lapse on the diet, or miss meals. The buildup of protein acids in their body becomes toxic. This is known as metabolic acidosis. Possible health problems include:

• Malfunction of kidney, liver, or pancreas
• Heart defects
• Vision loss
• Mental and learning delays or handicaps
• Brain damage
• Seizures
• Stroke
• Heart failure","• What type of diet does my child need to follow?

300,Osgood-Schlatter Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/osgood-schlatter-disease/,Osgood-Schlatter disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in growing children and athletes. Osgood-Schlatter is more common in boys than girls. It can occur during a growth spurt in pre-teens or teenagers. Kids who also play sports—especially running and jumping sports—are at greater risk.,"Osgood-Schlatter can affect one or both knees. The main symptoms are swelling and pain below the knee and above the shin bone (tibia). Activities that require running, jumping, and climbing may make the pain worse.",The leading cause of Osgood-Schlatter disease is pulled or overused muscles around the knee.,Your doctor will examine your child and discuss their symptoms. Your doctor may also want to do a knee X-ray to make sure the pain isn’t caused by something else.,Have your child do regular stretching and strengthening exercises. This is the best way to prevent Osgood-Schlatter disease.,"In most people, Osgood-Schlatter disease goes away on its own with rest and time. Your doctor may prescribe some exercises for your child to strengthen the quadriceps and hamstrings (muscles around the knee). These may be done at home or with a physical therapist.

While your child is recovering, your doctor may suggest that they rest from normal activities. This could mean cutting down on time spent playing sports until the pain has improved for a few weeks. Your child may need to avoid any activity that requires deep knee bending. They may also need to avoid or limit the amount of time running and jumping.

Your child can apply ice to their knee to reduce swelling and relieve pain. After applying ice, wrap your child’s knee with an elastic bandage and keep the leg elevated. Use the word RICE to help remind you of this at-home treatment:

R = Rest the knee from the painful activity.

I = Ice the knee for 20 minutes, 3 times a day.

C = Compress the knee with an elastic bandage.

If these treatment steps don’t work, the doctor may suggest that your child wear braces. These can help reduce tension on the muscles and tendons around the knee. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (one brand name: Motrin) may help relieve the pain and swelling. Do not give aspirin to children under 18 years of age. It can cause Reye’s syndrome. Your child may need to use crutches for a while to allow complete healing. As a last resort, your child’s doctor may suggest surgery.","Once your child stops growing, the pain and swelling should go away because the muscle attachment spot has closed and is solid. It is rare for Osgood-Schlatter disease to persist into adulthood.

It may take several weeks or months for the pain to stop. Once the pain is gone, your child may slowly return to their regular activity.

If your child ignores or plays through the pain, the disease may get worse and be more difficult to treat.","• What is the cause of my child’s knee pain?

301,Osteoarthritis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/osteoarthritis/,"Osteoarthritis is sometimes called degenerative joint disease or “wear-and-tear” arthritis. It can affect any joint in your body. It most often happens in the hands, hips, knees, and spine. It causes the cushion layer between your bones (called the cartilage) to wear away. This happens slowly and usually gets worse over time.

There are some factors that can increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, including:

• Being overweight or having obesity. Excess weight can make arthritis worse in the weight-bearing joints like knees, hips, and spine.
• Having a joint injury. Joints that have been injured, damaged, or had steroid injections are more likely to develop osteoarthritis.
• Repeating movements at work. People who have jobs that require the same movement over and over (like painting or lifting) are at higher risk.
• Being older. Osteoarthritis is more common in older people because they have been using their joints longer.
• Being a female. Women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis than men, especially after age 50.

If you’re having joint pain, tell your family doctor. Treating early can help prevent or reduce lifelong disability. Read More","The most common symptoms of osteoarthritis include:

• Pain or aching in the joint
• Stiffness in the joint, especially after not moving, such as after sleeping or sitting
• Swelling and tenderness in the joint
• A clicking noise when moving the joint
• A decreased range of motion in the joint","The exact cause of osteoarthritis isn’t known. It may be hereditary, which means it runs in families. People who play sports may get it because sports can be hard on joints. However, in most people, it seems to be related to the wear and tear put on joints over the years.

Normally, a smooth layer of cartilage acts as a pad between the bones of a joint. Cartilage helps the joint move easily and comfortably. In some people, the cartilage thins as the joints are used. This is the start of osteoarthritis. Over time, the cartilage wears away and the bones may rub against each other. The rubbing causes pain, swelling, and decreased motion of the joint.

Bones may even start to grow too thick on the ends where they meet to make a joint. Bits of cartilage may loosen and get in the way of movement. This also can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness.",Your doctor will ask you questions about your pain. They will probably ask you if your joint pain gets worse with activity and better with rest. Your doctor will examine you to see if you have trouble moving your joint. Your doctor may order an X-ray or an MRI of the joint that’s causing problems to see what’s causing the pain. Blood tests can help rule out other forms of arthritis.,"There’s not much you can do to avoid getting osteoarthritis as you age. However, the following may help:

• Try to not overuse your joints.
• Try to avoid jobs or activities that require repetitive movement.
• Maintain a healthy body weight.
• Do strength-training exercises to keep the muscles around your joints strong. This is especially important for weight-bearing joints, such as the hips, knees, and ankles.","There is no cure for osteoarthritis. It will probably get worse over time. But the right plan can help you stay active, protect your joints from damage, limit injury, and control pain. Your doctor will help you create a plan that is right for you. They will treat you with a combination of therapies.

Sometimes osteoarthritis becomes severe. It can cause severe joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. When other therapies haven’t worked, your doctor may give you a shot in your joint. The shot could contain pain medicine. This can stop the pain for days to weeks. Adding another medicine (called a corticosteroid) may keep the pain and inflammation away longer.

If this doesn’t help enough, your doctor may talk to you about hyaluronic acid injections. Your joints already contain hyaluronic acid. If you have osteoarthritis, that acid gets thinner. When this happens, there isn’t enough hyaluronic acid to protect the joint. These shots put more hyaluronic acid into your joint to help protect it. These injections are usually only used for osteoarthritis in the knee. These injections help some people, but not everyone. And some research has shown that they don’t work. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons doesn’t recommend using hyaluronic acid for osteoarthritis of the knee.

Talk to your doctor about injections to see if they would be a good choice for you.

Sometimes osteoarthritis is so severe that surgery is required to relieve the symptoms. There are many types of surgery for osteoarthritis. The type of surgery you may have depends on several factors. These include your age, your activity level, which joint is affected, and how bad the damage is. Talk to your doctor to learn which surgery will be best for you.

• Arthroscopy. With a tiny camera and special instruments, the surgeon can see how badly the joint has been damaged. They can remove damaged parts of the joint and clean the joint to remove any loose parts that may be causing you pain. It may provide temporary relief from pain or delay the need for other surgeries.
• Osteotomy. This surgery repositions or reshapes the bones in your joint where osteoarthritis has caused damage. It can shift your weight away from an area that has been damaged or correct misalignment in a joint. This procedure restores movement in your joint and relieves the pain. People who have an osteotomy may need joint replacement surgery in the future.
• Arthroplasty. This also is known as joint replacement therapy. A surgeon removes the damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial joint made from metals, plastic, and/or ceramic. All or part of the joint may be replaced. Joint replacement therapy can help put an end to your pain and improve or restore movement in your joint.","There are some things you can do to help you manage your life when you have osteoarthritis. They include:

• Lose weight if you’re overweight. This can reduce stress on your joints, especially the hips and knees.
• Exercise regularly for short periods. This can also help with losing weight. Talk to your doctor about a safe exercise program for you.
• Use a cane and other special devices to protect your joints.
• Avoid overusing your joints.
• Take your medicine the way your doctor tells you to.
• Use heat and/or cold therapies to reduce joint pain or swelling.
• Consider taking nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. They may help improve symptoms.
• Get support. Arthritis support groups, self-management programs, and patient education programs can help you learn about self-care and improve your outlook.","• What kind of arthritis do I have?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Arthritis is inflammation (swelling) of the joints. It causes pain and often limits movement of the affected joints. There are many kinds of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common kind.

It’s important to stay as active as possible. When joints hurt, people tend not to use them as much. Then the muscles get weak. This can cause the joint to work less effectively. That can make it harder to get around. This causes more pain, and the cycle begins again. Talk to your doctor about ways to control your pain so that you can stay active and avoid this problem.

Exercise keeps your muscles strong and helps you stay flexible. Exercises that don’t strain your joints are best. To avoid pain and injury, choose exercises that can be done in small amounts with rest time in between. Dancing, weight-lifting, swimming, and bike-riding are good exercises for people who have arthritis. Avoid activities that make your pain worse.

Your doctor may also prescribe physical therapy. This usually includes muscle-strengthening exercises that can help your joints work better and reduce arthritis pain.

Your doctor will probably recommend taking over-the-counter medicines to manage your pain. These are medicines you can buy without a doctor’s prescription. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce inflammation and relieve pain. They include aspirin, ibuprofen (one brand name: Advil), and naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). Other pain relievers may help you feel better, such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol).

Another over-the-counter option your doctor may recommend is a topical NSAID (one brand name: Voltaren Topical Gel). These are are available as creams, gels, or sprays that you can apply directly to the skin to treat pain and help with inflammation.

Your doctor can also prescribe medicine for you. This could be prescription pain relievers or prescription NSAIDs.

Medicine should be used wisely. You only need the amount that makes you feel good enough to keep moving. Using too much medicine may increase the risk of side effects.

Special supportive devices can help people who have arthritis stay independent. These devices help protect your joints and keep you moving. Devices can include canes, crutches, and walkers. Talk to your doctor if you think a special device may help your arthritis."
302,Osteochondritis Dissecans,https://familydoctor.org/condition/osteochondritis-dissecans/,"Osteochondritis dissecans (OC) is a joint problem. It occurs when an area of bone under a piece of cartilage in the joint dies. This happens because of a loss of blood supply to the area. It can cause a thin layer of bone and the cartilage to break loose. The loose piece may stay in place or fall into the joint space. This makes the joint unstable. It causes pain and feelings that the joint “sticks” or is “giving way.”

Osteochondritis dissecans most often occurs in the knees. It also may occur in other joints, including elbows, ankles, shoulders, and hips. It is most common in children and adolescents. It typically affects only one joint, but can affect multiple joints in children.","The symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans include:

• Pain in the joint, especially after activity
• Swelling of the affected joint
• Decreased joint movement, such as not being able to fully extend your arm or your leg
• Stiffness after resting
• A joint that “sticks” or “locks” in one position
• A clicking sound when you move the joint
• Weakening of the joint that makes it feel like it is “giving way”

These are all clues that you may have osteochondritis dissecans. See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms, or if you have persistent pain or soreness in a joint.","Doctors aren’t sure what causes osteochondritis dissecans. The loss of blood supply could be caused by repeated minor injuries or stress to the bone that you don’t even notice. Children and teens can get the condition when they spend months doing high-impact activities, such as running or jumping.","Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will ask you about your symptoms and your activities. They will check the joint to be sure it is stable. They will check for extra fluid in the joint. Your doctor will consider all the possible causes of joint pain. These could include fractures, sprains, damage to cartilage or ligaments, and osteochondritis dissecans.

If osteochondritis dissecans is suspected, your doctor will order X-rays to check all sides of the joint. If signs of osteochondritis dissecans are seen on X-rays of one joint, you may have X-rays of the other joint to compare them. After this, you may have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computerized tomography) imaging tests done. These tests can show whether the loose piece is still in place or whether it has moved into the joint space.","Since the cause of osteochondritis dissecans is unknown, it can be hard to avoid it. Children who are very active in sports can be taught how to reduce their chance of being injured. This includes learning the proper techniques and mechanics of their sport. It also includes using protective gear and participating in strength and stability exercises.","A child with osteochondritis dissecans might not need much treatment. If the child is still growing, the bone and cartilage will probably heal on their own. Your child needs to rest their joint and avoid sports until their symptoms get better. This might mean they need to use a brace, a cast, or crutches for a while.

For grown children and young adults, the problems can be worse. If the loose piece is stable (still in place), home treatment can help with the symptoms. This can include:

• Resting the affected joint
• Bracing the joint when playing sports
• Treating pain and inflammation with an over-the-counter pain reliever and anti-inflammatory medicine, such as ibuprofen (brand name: Advil)

If the loose piece is unstable (meaning it has moved into the joint space), you might need surgery to remove it or secure it.","Young people have the best chance of returning to their usual activity levels. But they might not be able to keep playing sports with repetitive motions, such as pitching in baseball. Adults are more likely to need surgery. They are less likely to be completely cured of the condition. They are at higher risk of later developing osteoarthritis in the affected joint.","• What could have caused my symptoms?

It happens more often in boys and young men 10 to 20 years of age who are very active. It is being diagnosed more often in girls as they become more active in sports. It affects athletes, especially gymnasts and baseball players.

If a nonsurgical treatment is recommended, you should avoid activities that cause discomfort. You should avoid competitive sports for 6 to 8 weeks. Your doctor may suggest stretching exercises or swimming instead as a means of physical therapy."
303,Osteopenia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/osteopenia/,"Osteopenia is a condition that begins as you lose bone mass and your bones get weaker. This happens when the inside of your bones become brittle from a loss of calcium. It’s very common as you age. Total bone mass peaks around age 35. Sometimes, osteopenia is a precursor to osteoporosis. People who have osteopenia are at a higher risk of having osteoporosis.","Most people who have osteopenia don’t have symptoms. Loss of bone mass isn’t painful. Broken bones or fractures can occur, but these problems tend to happen once you have osteoporosis.","During your life, your bones constantly change. New bone grows while old bone breaks down and your body absorbs it. When you’re young, you grow new bone faster than your body breaks down old bone. This contributes to a high bone mass. Once your body starts to break down old bone faster than it creates new bone, your bone mass begins to decrease. Loss of bone mass weakens your bones and can cause them to break. The beginning of this decline is known as osteopenia. For some people, it can lead to osteoporosis, which is more severe.

Women are more likely than men to have this condition for several reasons. Women have a lower bone mass overall and absorb less calcium than men do. They also tend to live longer. In women, the rate of bone loss speeds up after menopause as estrogen levels fall. Since the ovaries make estrogen, faster bone loss will occur if both ovaries are removed by surgery.","In order to diagnose osteopenia, your doctor will do a bone density test. Bone density measures bone mass and bone strength. One type of test is a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA). It measures bone density in your hips, spine, and wrist. The result can tell if you have osteopenia or osteoporosis, or if your bones are normal. The lower your score, the higher your risk of bone breakage. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 is labeled osteopenia. A T-score lower than -2.5 is labeled osteoporosis.

According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, all women over 65 years old should have a bone density test. Women under 65 years old should be tested as well if they’re at high risk.","You can’t always avoid osteopenia. No matter what you do, bone mass decreases over time. There are other natural factors that increase your risk, including:

• Being Caucasian or Asian (osteopenia is more common in these groups)
• Being a woman (osteopenia is more common in women than men)
• Having a family history of osteopenia or osteoporosis
• Beginning menopause early (before age 45)
• Having surgery to remove ovaries
• Having hyperthyroidism

There are some things you can do to lower your risk.

• Stop smoking or using tobacco.
• Avoid or limit alcohol use and drinking carbonated beverages.
• Get regular exercise.
• Maintain a healthy diet. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, can decrease your bone mass.
• Get enough calcium and vitamin D through foods or supplements.

Long-term use of certain medicines also can increase your risk. Examples include corticosteroids and anticonvulsants. Talk to your doctor about all the ways you can prevent unwanted bone loss.","Treatment for osteopenia starts with changes to your lifestyle. Your doctor will want you to increase your physical activity. Weight-bearing exercise can help strengthen your bones. It also can build muscle and improve your balance, which help prevent against broken bones. Examples of weight-bearing exercise include walking, jogging, and climbing steps.

Your doctor also will suggest ways to get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Nonfat and low-fat dairy products, such as yogurt, cheese, and milk, are good sources of calcium. Other sources of calcium include dried beans, salmon, spinach, and broccoli. Some foods, such as orange juice, breads, and dry cereals, may be fortified with calcium, vitamin D, or both. Your doctor may suggest a vitamin D or calcium supplement as well.",Early diagnosis and treatment of osteopenia is important. It can help prevent osteoporosis and future health problems.,"• Based on my age and lifestyle, am I at risk for osteopenia?
• When should I start being concerned about my bone density?

304,Osteoporosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/osteoporosis/,"Osteoporosis is a disease of the bones. It causes you to lose bone mass. Osteoporosis occurs most often in older adults. Women are more likely to have it than men. This is due to several factors. Women have less bone mass than men to begin with. Women also tend to live longer and absorb less calcium. In women, the rate of bone loss speeds up after menopause, when estrogen levels decrease. Since the ovaries make estrogen, faster bone loss may occur if both ovaries are removed by surgery.","You may not know you have osteoporosis until your symptoms are severe. Signs include frequent broken bones or fractures, low back pain, or a hunched back. You may get shorter over time due to osteoporosis. The condition can cause your vertebrae (the bones in your spine) to collapse. These problems tend to occur after a lot of bone calcium has already been lost.","There are two ways osteoporosis can occur. You can lose too much bone, or your body cannot produce enough bone. Some people have both issues. When you’re young, your bones are dense and strong. Osteoporosis makes your bones brittle and breakable.

It is natural to lose some bone mass as you age. For most adults, this begins in their mid 20s. Other factors can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Some of these risk factors are out of your control. For others, you can take steps to reduce your risk. Talk to your family doctor about your risk factors.

• Sex: Osteoporosis is more common in women than men.
• Age: The older you are, the greater your chance of having osteoporosis.
• Race: Caucasians and Asians are more likely to have osteoporosis.
• Genetics: Your risk of osteoporosis is higher if it runs in your family.
• Menopause: This period in a woman’s life causes physical and hormonal effects. For example, it lowers your estrogen. These changes can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Your risk is even higher if you have early menopause (before age 45).
• Body frame: People who have small, thin frames are more likely to develop osteoporosis.
• Health: Certain conditions, such as cancer or stroke, can lead to osteoporosis.

• Lack of calcium and/or vitamins
• Inactive lifestyle or lack of exercise
• Smoking or tobacco use
• Alcohol abuse
• Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa
• Hormonal imbalances. Examples include low estrogen or testosterone and high thyroid levels
• Long-term use of certain medicines. Examples include corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Corticosteroids treat inflammation, pain, and chronic conditions, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. PPIs help reduce stomach acid. These medicines can make it hard for your body to absorb calcium and cause osteoporosis.","Contact your doctor if you have signs of osteoporosis or if it runs in your family. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that certain women be screened for osteoporosis. This includes women who are 65 years and older or have an equal or greater fracture risk. Your doctor can help you assess your fracture risk. Currently, the AAFP does not recommend that men be screened for osteoporosis.

To diagnose the condition, your doctor will do a bone density scan. This is a common test that measures your bone density. It is called a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The scan often checks your hips, spine, and wrist. These are the most common places to have osteoporosis.

The AAFP does not recommend that doctors use DEXA scans for women younger than 65 or men younger than 70 unless there are risk factors.","You cannot always avoid osteoporosis. However, there are some changes you can make to prevent or reduce your risk. These include regular exercise and getting enough calcium and vitamin D. They help keep your bones healthy as you age.

Calcium. Women 50 years of age and younger and men 70 years of age and younger should get 1,000 mg of calcium per day. For women older than 50 years of age and men older than 70 years of age, 1,200 mg of calcium per day is recommended. Women who are post-menopausal may need 1,500 mg of calcium per day. It is best to get your calcium from food. Nonfat and low-fat dairy products are good sources of calcium. Other options include dried beans, salmon, spinach, and broccoli. If you don’t get enough calcium from the food you eat, your doctor may suggest taking a calcium supplement.

Vitamin D. Most people need about 800 International Units (IU) of vitamin D each day. It helps your body absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from sunlight, food, and supplements. Your skin makes vitamin D when it is exposed to sunlight. However, you should be careful of sun exposure. Too much can cause skin cancer. Your doctor can test your blood to measure your vitamin D level. If your vitamin D level is low, your doctor may suggest taking a supplement.

Exercise. Regular exercise helps you build and keep strong bones. This is why it’s important to begin an active lifestyle at a young age. However, it’s never too late to start exercising. Ask your doctor for tips on how to exercise safely. Try to do a mix of strength training and weight-bearing exercises.","Treatment for osteoporosis starts with changes to your diet and lifestyle. You need to get enough calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor will want you to increase your physical activity. This helps to strengthen your bones and increase your bone mass. Examples of weight-bearing exercises include walking, jogging, and climbing steps. You also should stop smoking and limit alcohol.

If you’re at risk for falls, reduce your risk by getting rid of tripping hazards in your home. For example, remove rugs, avoid slick surfaces, and move electrical cords. You can install grab bars in certain places, such as your bathroom and shower. The bars can help you move around more easily and safely.

Your doctor may prescribe medicine(s) to help treat osteoporosis. There are several types and forms.

Biophosphonates. This type helps reduce your risk of breaks and fractures. It also increases bone density. It comes in oral (pill) form or intravenous (IV or injection) form. Side effects can include nausea or stomach pain. You may have irritation of the esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth and stomach). Some people cannot take biophosphonates. This includes people who have kidney disease or low levels of calcium in their blood, and women who are pregnant or nursing. Examples of biophosphonates include:

• Alendronate and risedronate.These medicines are used to help prevent and treat osteoporosis. They help reduce your risk of fractures by decreasing the rate of bone loss. They are available in pill form. Their most common side effect is an upset stomach.
• Ibandronate. This medicine helps to slow bone loss and increase bone density. It is available as a pill or injection. You have 2 options for the pill. You can take it daily or monthly. For the injection, your doctor or nurse will give you a shot every 3 months. Side effects may include lower back or side pain, shortness of breath, tightness in your chest, and bloody or cloudy urine.
• Zoledronic acid.This medicine is given through IV once a year.

Calcitonin. This is a hormone that helps slow down bone loss. It is available as an injection or nasal spray. Side effects of the injection include diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Side effects of the nose spray include headache and irritation of your nose lining.

Raloxifene. This medicine helps prevent and treat osteoporosis in women. It increases your bone density. It is not a hormone, but it mimics some of the effects of estrogen. Side effects may include hot flashes and a risk of blood clots.

Teriparatide. This medicine helps to grow new bones. It is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone. Both women and men can use it. It is available as an injection. You inject it in your thigh or stomach once a day. Common side effects are nausea, stomach pain, headache, muscle weakness, fatigue, and loss of appetite.

Denosumab. This drug is used when other drugs don’t work or if you can’t tolerate other treatment options. Denosumab increases your bone density. It can be used by both women and men. It is given as an injection by your doctor. Side effects can include lower calcium levels, skin rash, or pain in the arms and legs.

If your doctor prescribes medicine to treat osteoporosis, it is important that you take it.

When your doctor prescribes a medicine, be sure to discuss:

• Side effects
• Any fears you have about taking medicines (especially if this may cause you to stop)
• The higher likelihood of fractures if you stop taking your medicine
• How you will let your doctor know if you fall
• When your next follow-up visit will be. (Schedule this for 3-6 months after your appointment.)",There is no complete cure for osteoporosis. You should work with your doctor to treat the condition.

305,Osteosarcoma,https://familydoctor.org/condition/osteosarcoma/,"Osteosarcoma is a kind of bone cancer that most often affects children, teenagers, and young adults between the ages of 10 and 20. It usually begins in a leg bone (either the femur or the tibia) near the knee or in the upper arm bone (the humerus) near the shoulder. Osteosarcoma can metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. Most often it spreads to the lungs or to other bones.

Osteosarcoma isn’t a common cancer. Only between 800 and 900 cases occur in the United States each year. But it is the most common bone cancer in children and teenagers. It’s slightly more likely to affect males.","Most people who have osteosarcoma don’t feel or look sick. An osteosarcoma tumor may cause a dull aching pain in the bone or joint around the tumor. Often, there is a firm swelling or lump in the area of the pain. This swelling is caused by the tumor growing inside the bone.

If the cancer is in a leg bone, the person may limp. Also, the muscles in the arm or leg that have the osteosarcoma may look smaller than the muscles in the opposite arm or leg. Sometimes, the bone can break in the area of the tumor because the tumor weakens the bone.","Osteosarcoma has no known cause. Some researchers believe that genetics may play a role. In some cases, osteosarcoma can develop because of radiation therapy.","There are several tests your doctor may use to determine if your child has osteosarcoma:

• Physical exam: The doctor will check for general signs of health as well as examine the place around the swelling, lump, or break. The doctor will also ask about any previous health conditions or medical treatments.
• X-ray: An X-ray is usually the first imaging test your doctor will order. If there is a tumor, it will usually show up on the X-ray.
• Scans: Your doctor may order various scans such as an MRI scan, a CT scan (also called a CAT scan) a PET scan, or combinations of scans. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans take pictures that help your doctor see in detail if the tumor has spread or involved nearby portions of the bone. A CT (computed tomography) scan can look at the bone but is also used to look at the chest or abdomen for signs of spread to internal organs. Similarly, a PET (positron emission tomography) scan can also help to show if the tumor has spread to other bones or other parts of the body.
• Biopsy: A biopsy is important because other malignant (cancerous) tumors and some infections can look like osteosarcoma on an X-ray. For the biopsy, a doctor with special training takes a piece of the tumor from the bone. The doctor can sometimes do the biopsy with a needle. Other times, they will need to make an incision (a cut in the skin). The piece of tissue the doctor takes is looked at under a microscope to see if the tumor is an osteosarcoma.
• Other tests: The doctor may recommend other tests to see if the cancer has spread to the lungs or other organs. For example, a bone scan will help the doctor see if the cancer has spread to other bones. Other tests may also be needed.",There are no known ways to prevent osteosarcoma.,"Osteosarcoma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation therapy. For chemotherapy, your child or teenager will be given medicines that kill the main tumor. These medicines will also kill any tumor cells that have moved to other parts of the body. This treatment is usually started before surgery to kill the tumor or make it smaller.

Surgery is performed to remove the tumor. Almost everyone who has this type of cancer can have “limb-sparing” surgery. In this surgery, the tumor is removed along with the area of bone that it grew in. Then the doctor replaces the missing bone so that, after rehabilitation, the joint will still work normally. In some cases, the doctor may recommend amputation (removal of the limb) as the best way to remove the tumor.

After the surgery, the doctor may recommend more chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy help kill any remaining cancer cells that might be left in the body after surgery.","Today, about 3 out of 4 people who have osteosarcoma can be cured if the cancer hasn’t spread to other parts of the body. Almost everyone who is treated with limb-sparing surgery ends up with that arm or leg working well.

Many people who have osteosarcoma will need physical therapy for several months after surgery. If amputation is necessary, rehabilitation may last for much longer. There are many new prosthetic treatments now available to help people who have had amputations regain movement and independence.

After the treatment is over, you or your loved one will:

• Need to see the bone cancer specialist regularly for several years.
• Have frequent scans to see if the tumor comes back or travels to the lungs or other parts of the body.
• Have X-rays to check for problems with any replaced pieces of bone.","• My child has osteosarcoma. How can I make him/her more comfortable?
• My child walks with a limp, but there’s no swelling. Should he/she be tested for osteosarcoma?
• If I have osteosarcoma, will I lose my leg/arm?
• If I have osteosarcoma once, am I more likely to get it again?
• After my treatment for osteosarcoma is over, how often will I have to come back for follow-up visits?
• I’m in my 40s and I have a swelling in my leg. Could it be osteosarcoma?

306,Otitis Externa (Swimmer's Ear),https://familydoctor.org/condition/otitis-externa-swimmers-ear/,"Swimmer’s ear is an irritation, swelling, or infection in your ear. It’s often caused by swimming a lot or swimming in unclean water. It can occur suddenly. It’s common in children and young adults but can happen to anybody. The medical name for swimmer’s ear is otitis externa.

Swimmer’s ear infects the outer ear or ear canal. Because those areas are dark and warm, bacteria and fungus can grow there to create an infection. Note this type of infection is different than an inner ear infection.","There are many symptoms of swimmer’s ear, including:

• Pain and/or itching
• A plugged-up feeling in the affected ear
• Some hearing loss
• Clear or pus-like drainage
• Swelling inside the ear and painful to the touch

In serious cases, swimmer’s ear can spread to other areas of the ear. This includes the skull bone. The infection can become severe in older people and people who have diabetes.","Several things can cause swimmer’s ear, including:

• Swimming in unclean water.
• Swimming and showering too much. Water can accumulate in the ear canal, which allows germs to grow.
• Excessive cleaning of your ears. Earwax helps to flush germs from the ear. Removing too much may allow germs to spread and start an infection.
• Injuring the skin in the ear canal. This can happen by putting your finger or an object (such as a cotton swab) in your ear.
• Some skin conditions. If you have conditions such as eczema and psoriasis in other places on your body, they can occur in the ear canal, too. This can cause an infection.
• Bacteria from products used in your hair, such as hairspray or hair dye. These products can get trapped in your ear canal.","Your doctor will look inside your ears. As they do, touching or moving it may hurt. The infected ear will appear red and swollen. It also may look scaly. Your doctor will check your eardrum for infection or a hole. They may not be able to see the eardrum due to swelling.

Your doctor may take a sample of fluid from the ear to send to a lab. The lab is checking for bacteria or fungus.","Follow these tips to prevent swimmer’s ear:

• Never put anything in the ear canal. This includes cotton swabs, your finger, liquids, sprays, etc. If your ears itch, see your doctor.
• Don’t remove earwax on your own. If you think your earwax affects your hearing, see your doctor.
• Take steps while in the water. When swimming, wear a bathing cap or wet suit hood. Special earplugs can keep water out of your ears.
• Keep your ears dry. Use a towel to dry your ears after swimming or showering. Let the water run out of your ears. Turn your head to each side and pull the earlobe in different directions to let the water drain out. You also can use a hair dryer set on the low heat to dry your ears. Hold the dryer several inches from your ear.
• Try to avoid bacteria. To help prevent bacteria from growing in your ear, mix one drop of rubbing alcohol with one drop of white vinegar. Place the drops of the mixture into the ears after they get wet.","Your doctor will clean the drainage or pus from your ear. They will likely prescribe antibiotic ear drops to make your infection go away and may prescribe oral antibiotics if your case is severe. They may also prescribe other medicine to help with itching. Over-the-counter medicine can relieve pain. Ask your doctor what type you should take.

After your diagnosis, keep your ear as dry as possible for 7 to 10 days. Take baths instead of showers. Put a cotton ball in each ear to keep the water out. And don’t swim during that time. Your symptoms should be better in 3 days. They should go away in 10 days.","Swimmer’s ear usually isn’t serious if it’s treated early. Most symptoms will go away as the infection clears up. In rare cases, the infection can spread and cause damage to skin tissue, bone, and cartilage. Older adults, people with diabetes or weakened immune systems are most at risk for more widespread infection.

• Can I get swimmer’s ear from chlorinated pool water?
• How much swimming is too much swimming?
• Am I more likely to get swimmer’s ear if I have small eustachian tubes?
• Should my baby wear ear plugs in the bath and in pools? Are those safe?
• Can repeated infections cause serious hearing loss?
• Can I get swimmer’s ear from taking showers?

307,Otitis Media (with Effusion),https://familydoctor.org/condition/otitis-media-with-effusion/,"Otitis media is a generic term that refers to an inflammation of the middle ear. The middle ear is the space behind the eardrum. Otitis media with effusion means there is fluid (effusion) in the middle ear, without an infection.

Fluid in the middle ear can have few symptoms, especially if it develops slowly. It almost always goes away on its own in a few weeks to a few months. So, this kind of ear problem doesn’t usually need to be treated with antibiotics. Your doctor may decide to treat it if it causes a painful infection or if the fluid doesn’t go away.

Otitis media with effusion is most common in young children, age 2 and under. But it can affect people of any age.","Children who have otitis media with effusion may not have any symptoms. Usually they don’t act sick. They could experience the following:

• A feeling of fullness in the ear.
• Muffled hearing.
• Fluid that drains from the ears (if the eardrum has ruptured).
• Some pain inside the ear (if your child is too young to speak and tell you his or her ear hurts, he or she may tug at the ear often).

If your child’s otitis media with effusion develops into an infection, he or she may have other symptoms. These include:

• Pain in the ear (crying or pulling at the ear for very young children).
• Fever.
• Irritability.
• Listlessness.
• Trouble hearing.
• Not feeling like eating or sleeping.

The. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advise against the use of ear candles. Ear candles can cause serious injuries and there is no evidence to support their effectiveness. For more information, please visit the FDA Web site.","The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the back of the throat. Normally, this tube lets fluid drain out of the middle ear. But sometimes the Eustachian tube swells. It can become partially or completely blocked. This can cause fluid to build up in the middle ear.

The following may cause the Eustachian tube to swell:

• Allergies.
• Irritants, such as cigarette smoke.
• Respiratory infections.
• Enlarged adenoids (glands near the ear).
• Drinking while lying on the back (bottle-fed babies).
• A sudden increase in air pressure (descending in an airplane or driving on a mountain).

If the Eustachian tubes are blocked, fluid in the ear cannot drain normally. If bacteria grow in the middle ear fluid, an effusion can turn into a middle ear infection (acute otitis media). This will usually increase pressure behind the eardrum and cause a lot of pain. The eardrum will become red and bulging. If this happens, your child may need to be treated with antibiotics. Children who have frequent ear infections can also develop otitis media with effusion after their infection is gone, if fluid stays in the middle ear.

It is not a good idea to let your baby fall asleep with a bottle or to leave a bottle in the crib. Drinking while lying down can wash bacteria from the throat right into the Eustachian tubes and middle ear space. This increases the risk for tube blockage and infection.","If you think your child may have otitis media with effusion, make an appointment your child’s doctor. He or she will look in your child’s ears. They will look at the eardrum for signs that there may be fluid behind it. They may order a test called tympanometry. It can diagnose otitis media with effusion. It can also help tell the amount and thickness of the fluid that is trapped. They may also want to do a hearing test on your child.","The best ways to prevent fluid build-up in the ears are the same as preventing ear infections:

• Wash your child’s hands and toys often.
• Avoid pacifiers.
• Breastfeed your baby.
• If you bottle-feed your baby, hold him or her in an upright, seated position when feeding them.
• Keep your child away from cigarette smoke.
• Make sure your child’s vaccinations are up to date.","If your child is older than 6 months of age and only has mild symptoms, the best treatment is to let the fluid go away on its own. You can give your child an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, (one brand: Children’s Tylenol) if he or she is uncomfortable. A warm, moist cloth placed over the ear may also help.

Usually the fluid goes away in 2 to 3 months, and hearing returns to normal. Your doctor may want to check your child again at some point to see if fluid is still present. If it is, he or she may give your child antibiotics.

One treatment your doctor may suggest is a nasal balloon. A nasal balloon can help clear the fluid from the middle ear. You can easily use a nasal balloon at home. Your child will simply insert the balloon nozzle in one nostril while blocking the other nostril with a finger. Then, he or she will inflate the balloon with their nose.

If the fluid does not go away after a certain amount of time and treatment, your child may need ear tubes. These small tubes are inserted through the ear drum. They allow the doctor to suction out the fluid behind the ear. They also allow air to get into the middle ear, which helps prevent fluid build-up. Any hearing loss experienced by your child should be restored after the fluid is drained.","Most cases of otitis media with effusion go away on their own in a few weeks or months. Treatment may speed up the process. Most children don’t have any long-term effects to their ears, their hearing, or their speaking ability. This is the case even if they had fluid build-up in their ears for a long time.

In a few cases, otitis media with effusion could lead to longer term issues. These include:

• Recurrent ear infections.
• Problems with speech and language development.
• Permanent hearing loss.

But most children recover quickly and have no long-term effects.","• What caused fluid to build up in my or my child’s ear?
• Do I or my child need treatment?
• What kind of treatment will be best for me or my child?
• Does my child need ear tubes?","• Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment by Harmes KM, et al. (American Family Physician October 01, 2013)

308,Ovarian Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ovarian-cancer/,"Ovarian cancer is cancer in one or both ovaries. Ovaries are small organs located on each side of a women’s pelvis. They produce sex hormones, regulate the menstrual cycle, and produce eggs. While ovarian cancer isn’t common, women of any age can get it. It is serous and, if it progresses too far, it can be fatal.","Most women don’t have symptoms of ovarian cancer until the cancer has spread outside the ovary. Plus, symptoms are similar to other medical conditions, not just ovarian cancer. When they do occur, symptoms include:

• Menstrual changes (unusual bleeding or discharge)
• Bloating or swollen stomach
• Diarrhea, constipation, or frequent urination
• Stomach, back, or pelvic pain
• Lump in the pelvic area
• Loss of appetite or quickly feeling full
• Nausea
• Digestion problems

Because these symptoms can have many causes, ovarian cancer may be hard to diagnose early. That’s why it’s good to know your body. Be aware of slight changes and share them with your doctor. Also, talk with your doctor if your symptoms persist or worsen.","Family history is one of the biggest risk factors for ovarian cancer. The breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are hereditary. If you have these genes, and if they change inside your body, they can cause ovarian cancer. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends genetic counseling and testing for women with this family history. Talk to your doctor if you think you meet the screening requirements.

There are other risk factors for ovarian cancer. These include your pregnancy and reproductive history, use of hormone replacement therapy, poor diet, and inactivity. But being at high risk for ovarian cancer doesn’t mean you’ll get it. Your doctor can perform tests to examine potential signs. These tests include a pelvic and vaginal exam, X-ray, ultrasound, or blood test.

Cancer from other areas in your body, such as your breasts or colon, can also lead to ovarian cancer.","Your doctor will talk with you about your medical history, your family’s medical history, and your symptoms. They will do a pelvic exam to feel for issues with your ovaries.

Your doctor also may order a pelvic ultrasound. This is a painless procedure that will take pictures of the inside of your body. Your doctor also may ask you to have a biopsy. This is when a piece of the mass in your ovary is removed and sent to a lab to examine under a microscope. A biopsy is the only way to confirm ovarian cancer.

The AAFP does not recommend ovarian cancer screening. Screening is used to identify conditions prior to having any symptoms. AAFP has found that ovarian cancer screening is not accurate or valuable. AAFP also recommends against genetic counseling related to ovarian cancer, unless you are high risk.","Ovarian cancer can’t be prevented or avoided. However, certain risk factors increase your chances of getting it. These include:

• Having the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes
• Having a family history of ovarian cancer
• Having a personal history of breast, cervical, colon, or melanoma cancer
• Having a personal history of Lynch syndrome (a medical condition)
• Having endometriosis (a medical condition that causes tissue to grow outside your uterus)
• Having infertility or being pregnant later in life
• Being of Ashkenazi Jewish decent (Eastern European)
• Taking hormone replacement therapy for 5 years or more

Talk to your doctor about screening or testing if you have any of these. If you’re extremely high-risk, your doctor might recommend removing your ovaries. This surgery is called an oophorectomy.

Any woman can develop ovarian cancer. Studies show that some things can reduce your risk, such as:

• Giving birth
• Breastfeeding for 1 or more years
• Using (or previous use of) birth control pills
• Removing ovaries, having tubes (fallopian) tied, or having a hysterectomy (surgery to remove all or part of the uterus)","Treatment requires a team of specialists. Your doctor will refer you to a specialist called an oncologist. This doctor specializes in cancer treatment. You also may be referred to a surgeon. They may be able to remove your cancer.

Both the oncologist and the surgeon will discuss treatment with you. After meeting with them, you may want to seek a “second opinion” from another oncologist and/or surgeon.

Treatments vary based on the type, grade, and stage of cancer.","Treatment is more successful if the cancer is detected early. Also, your outcome depends on your general health, and the type, grade, and stage of cancer.

Your doctor will monitor your treatment. They will check to see if the cancer is gone. Your doctor also might perform regular tests to detect its return. You might have lasting side effects from the cancer treatment. Your doctor will work with you to reduce those.","• What is the type, grade, and stage of my cancer?
• What outcome can I expect based on the type, grade, and stage of my cancer?
• Has my cancer spread?
• What treatment is best for me?
• What are the side effects of treatment?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","There are many types of ovarian cancer that fall into main categories.

• Epithelial tumor. This is the most common, and most dangerous, type of ovarian cancer. It forms in the tissue that covers your ovary.
• Germ cell tumor. This develops in the cells that create your eggs each month. This type of ovarian cancer is most common in teens and women younger than 30 years old.
• Stromal tumor. This develops in the tissues that produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. This type of cancer is rare.
• Primary peritoneal cancer is one of the less common types. This cancer starts in the peritoneum. That is the tissue that lines your stomach and covers your female organs.

Grades rate how the cancer cells look compared to healthy cells. If there’s not much difference, the tumor is a low-grade tumor. If there’s a lot of difference, the tumor is a high-grade tumor. Grades can help your doctor determine how the cancer may act in the future.

Stages rate if the cancer is contained to the ovary or if it has spread. Your surgeon will be able to help determine the staging during surgery to remove the tumor. You doctor also may order additional tests to see if the cancer has spread to other areas of your body. This is usually done with imaging, such as an X-ray, colonoscopy, CT (computed tomography) scan, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), or PET (positron emission tomography). There are four stages of cancer. Stage 4 is the most severe.

The goal of cancer treatment is:

• To remove or get rid of cancer
• To keep the cancer from spreading
• To reduce side effects and pain related to cancer

Most treatment programs include a mix of:

• Surgery to remove the cancerous cells and tissue. It also may include removal of the affected and surrounding organs.
• Chemotherapy to reduce or kill the cancer. Chemo medicine can be given in pill, liquid, or IV (intravenous) form. Also, it can be injected directly into the affected area.
• Radiation to reduce or kill the cancer using high-energy waves, similar to X-rays."
309,Ovarian Cyst,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ovarian-cyst/,"An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac in or on a person’s ovary. The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They produce eggs and hormones.

Ovarian cysts are very common. They often occur during ovulation. This is when the ovary releases an egg each month. These are called functional cysts. Most are noncancerous. Many times, these cysts go away on their own without treatment.

It is common for a person with regular periods to develop an ovarian cyst. They are less common after menopause. Individuals who have reached menopause and have an ovarian cyst are at higher risk for ovarian cancer.","Often, functional cysts do not cause any symptoms. You may have one and not know it. Other times they can cause symptoms, including:

• A sharp or dull pain in the lower abdomen, usually on one side
• Bloating
• Menstrual irregularities
• Nausea and vomiting
• Feeling full after eating a small amount
• Constipation

If you are menopausal and are not having periods, functional cysts shouldn’t form. But it is possible for other types of ovarian cysts to form. Call your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of an ovarian cyst.","The most common causes of ovarian cysts include:

• Hormonal problems. They can also be caused by hormone-based medicines that help ovulation.
• Early pregnancy. It is normal for an ovarian cyst to form during early pregnancy. It helps support the pregnancy until the placenta forms.
• People with a condition called endometriosis can develop a type of ovarian cyst called an endometrioma. This is when endometriosis tissue attaches to the ovary and forms a growth.
• Pelvic infections. Severe infections can spread to the ovaries and cause cysts to form.
• Polycystic ovary syndrome. This is a disease where the ovaries make many small cysts. It can cause problems with the ovaries and with getting pregnant.","Often, your doctor will feel a cyst during a pelvic exam. If you have a cyst, your doctor can do two things. One is to wait and watch to see if the cyst changes or starts causing symptoms. The other is to order tests to help plan treatment. What they choose to do depends on several factors. These include your age and if you’re having symptoms.

If your doctor orders tests, they will probably want you to have a sonogram (ultrasound) so they can look at the cyst. A sonogram uses sound waves to make pictures of organs in the body. With a sonogram, your doctor can see the size, shape, and location of the cyst as well as if it is solid or filled with fluid.

Your doctor could also order other tests. These could include:

• A pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy as the cause of the cyst.
• Hormone level tests to see if you have problems with your hormones.
• A CA-125 blood test to measure the amount of cancer-antigen 125 in your blood. If you are past menopause, your doctor may order this test to see if your cyst could be cancerous.","If you are ovulating normally, there is nothing you can do to prevent a functional ovarian cyst from forming. If you get cysts frequently, your doctor may prescribe hormonal birth control. This will stop you from ovulating and lower your chances of getting new cysts.","The treatment for ovarian cysts depends on several things. This includes your age, whether you are having periods, the size of the cyst, its appearance, and your symptoms.

Functional cysts normally shrink on their own over time, usually in about 1 to 3 months. If you have a functional cyst, your doctor may want to check you again in 1 to 3 months to check on the status of the cyst. If you develop functional cysts often, your doctor may want you to take birth control pills or other hormonal birth control so you won’t ovulate. If you don’t ovulate, you won’t form functional cysts.

Surgery is an option for some people. You may need surgery if the cyst:

• Doesn’t go away after several menstrual periods
• Gets larger
• Looks unusual on the sonogram
• Causes pain

In addition, if you’re past menopause and have an ovarian cyst, your doctor will probably want you to have surgery. Ovarian cancer is rare, but individuals 50 to 70 years of age are at greater risk. People who are diagnosed with cancer at an early stage do much better than those who are diagnosed later.

There are 2 main ways surgery can be done on an ovarian cyst:

• If your cyst is small (about the size of a plum or smaller) and if it looks benign on the sonogram, your doctor may decide to do a laparoscopy. This procedure is done with a lighted instrument called a laparoscope that’s like a slender telescope. It is put into your abdomen through a small incision (cut) near your navel (belly button). With the laparoscope, your doctor can see your organs. Often the cyst can be removed through small incisions at the pubic hair line.
• If the cyst looks too big to remove with a laparoscope or if it looks suspicious in any way, your doctor will probably do a laparotomy. This surgery uses a bigger cut to remove the cyst. The cyst is then tested for cancer. If it is cancerous, you may need to have the ovary and other tissues removed. This could include the fallopian tubes, the other ovary, or the uterus. It’s important to talk to your doctor about all of this before that surgery.

Your doctor will talk to you about the risks of each kind of surgery. They will tell you how long you are likely to be in the hospital and how long it will be before you can go back to your normal activities.","If you have an ovarian cyst, you can usually just wait for it to go away on its own in a few months. But sometimes cysts can break open. This is called a rupture. This can cause a lot of pain and heavy bleeding. If you know you have an ovarian cyst and you experience any of the following symptoms, get medical help right away:

• Sudden, severe abdominal pain
• Abdominal pain with fever and vomiting
• Faintness, dizziness, or weakness
• Rapid breathing","• Do I need a sonogram?
• What kind of cyst do I have?
• If it’s a functional cyst, do I need any treatment?
• How will I know if my functional cyst is getting worse?
• If I have another type of cyst, what are my treatment options? Will I need surgery?
• Am I at risk of having another ovarian cyst in the future?
• Can having ovarian cysts make it harder to get pregnant?","National Library of Medicine, MedlinePlus: Ovarian Cysts

310,Overactive Bladder | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/overactive-bladder/,Overactive bladder is a condition that causes you to lose control of your bladder without warning. You may have to urinate more often or urgently. Sometimes you may leak a small amount of urine before you make it to the bathroom.,"• Having to urinate 8 or more times per day or having to urinate 2 or more times during the night
• An urgent and sudden need to urinate with no warning
• Leaking urine after that urgent, sudden feeling to urinate

If you have 2 or more of these symptoms, you may have overactive bladder.

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","Nerve and muscle damage near your bladder causes overactive bladder. The damage causes your bladder to contract (squeeze) at an unplanned time. That’s what causes leaking and the sudden, urgent need to urinate. Sometimes, having too much fluid in your bladder or too much caffeine can cause overactive bladder.

• Vaginal childbirth (for women)
• Prostate problems (for men)
• Spinal cord or brain injuries or infections
• Diabetes
• Stroke
• Multiple sclerosis
• Exposure to heavy metals
• Birth defect

Bladder cancer can lead to overactive bladder. In most cases, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) does not recommend routine screening for bladder cancer unless you have symptoms of overactive bladder.","Your doctor will start by discussing your symptoms and medical history. They might order certain tests to help diagnose the problem. These tests might include:

• Urodynamics: During this test, your doctor will fill your bladder and then see how well it empties.
• Imaging: Your doctor may need to look inside your bladder through the use of an X-ray, CT scan (computerized tomography), or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).
• EEG and EMG:Electroencephalograph (EEG) and electromyograph (EMG) testing looks at how well your bladder functions. Wires and pads are placed on your lower abdomen (stomach). These wires are able to test the nerves inside.","Overactive bladder cannot be prevented. However, you can reduce the risk of overactive bladder by treating those diseases and conditions that cause it. For example, following your doctor’s treatment advice for diabetes will reduce nerve damage. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor about the potential for bladder damage if you have a vaginal delivery.","Overactive bladder can be treated with medicine, bladder exercises, electrical stimulation, or surgery. Your doctor will tell you which is best for you.

Your doctor may prescribe medicine to treat your overactive bladder. Muscle relaxants help control muscle spasms that cause your bladder to squeeze at the wrong time. Common side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, a fast heartbeat, and a flushed feeling (feeling warm and red). The medicine can be prescribed as a pill or patch.

Bladder exercises strengthen and retrain your bladder to hold the urine until you can get to a bathroom.

• Kegel exercises: These are specific exercises you can do by tightening your urinary muscles (as if you’re trying to hold back your urine) and then letting go. Do this several times throughout the day and it will strengthen your bladder muscles.
• Retraining: Your doctor may recommend keeping a diary of your bladder control. It might include how much fluid you consume, how often you feel like you have to go to the bathroom, and whether you had any leakage. This might help you plan trips to the bathroom and fluid intake.

This is a medical procedure that sends safe, electrical pulses through your vagina or anus (bottom). They also can be given through a patch. Another method involves placing a wire near your tailbone. Your doctor will tell you how many treatments are necessary for you.

There is a surgical procedure known as augmentation cystoplasty. This may be necessary in severe cases, or when no other treatment works. It involves making your bladder larger. Part of your bowel may be used to expand your bladder. This gives you more room to store urine. The risks of this surgery include a tear in your bladder (leaking urine in your body), bladder stones, mucus in the bladder, and infection.","Living with overactive bladder will depend on how serious your problem is and how well your treatment works. In either case, living with the condition may require better planning. You may have to plan when you consume liquids and how close you are to a bathroom. You also may consider wearing disposable undergarments that protect your clothing from leaking urine.","• How do you treat babies and children who were born with overactive bladder?

311,Pancreatic Cancer | Symptoms and treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pancreatic-cancer/,Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form on your pancreas. Your pancreas is an organ. It is located behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces juices that break down food and control blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose early.,"Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:

• Jaundice (yellowing) of the skin and eyes
• Stomach pain
• Back pain
• Weight loss (without trying)
• Poor appetite
• Dark, brown urine
• Light-colored or greasy stools (poop)
• Itchy skin
• Nausea, vomiting
• Enlarged gallbladder or liver
• Blood clots
• Diabetes (it’s rare that pancreatic cancer causes diabetes if you didn’t already have it)

Pancreatic cancer is hard to detect early. That’s because it often doesn’t cause symptoms until it spreads to other parts of the body. As a result, doctors often don’t diagnose it until it reaches a more advanced stage, which makes it harder to treat. Like with most cancers, early detection improves the chances of successful treatment.

If your doctor diagnoses pancreatic cancer early, they will likely begin treatment right away using one of the options discussed earlier.

However, if the cancer reaches a later stage, your care team may shift the focus to helping you feel more comfortable rather than curing the disease. This type of care, called palliative care, aims to improve your quality of life by managing pain and easing symptoms.","No one knows what causes pancreatic cancer. There are certain risk factors. These include:

• Smoking
• Obesity
• Inactivity
• Workplace exposure to chemicals
• Gender
• Family history of inherited genetic syndromes. These include breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, breast cancer, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, familial pancreatitis, Lynch syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
• Diabetes
• Chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
• Unhealthy diet
• Coffee
• Alcohol
• Certain infections (H. pylori or Hepatitis B)","The pancreas is buried deep inside the body. This can make an early diagnosis difficult. If your doctor suspects you have pancreatic cancer, they might do the following:

• Perform a physical exam (your doctor will feel your stomach for the presence of large tumors).
• Order imaging tests. This can include an ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET scan.
• Order a blood test. The specific test is called a CA 19-9 blood marker test.
• Do a biopsy (surgically remove a sample from the pancreas).","Pancreatic cancer cannot be prevented or avoided. However, you can make lifestyle changes to lower certain risk factors. Those include:

• Exercising daily. Strive for 20 to 30 minutes per day.
• Quitting smoking
• Limiting alcohol
• Controlling your diabetes
• Losing weight
• Eating a healthful diet

You should also talk to your doctor about any genetic risk factors you may have.","Most pancreatic cancer cases are diagnosed late (Stage 4). This means the cancer has likely spread to other areas of the body. Depending on the stage of the cancer, surgery may be possible. There are five types of standard treatment used for pancreatic cancer:

• Surgery: This involves removal of the tumor. In extreme cases, it may mean removing the entire pancreas.
• Radiation therapy: This uses high energy x-rays or other radiation to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells.
• Chemotherapy: This therapy uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells.
• Chemoradiation therapy: This combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
• Targeted therapy: Drugs are used to identify and attack specific cancer cells. This is done to cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation.",null,"• Is pancreatic cancer common in younger people?

312,Pancreatitis - What causes pancreatitis?,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pancreatitis/,"Pancreatitis is inflammation (swelling) of your pancreas. The pancreas is a gland near your stomach and liver. It makes digestive juices, or enzymes. These help you absorb and digest food. Pancreatitis happens when the enzymes damage the pancreas, causing inflammation.

There are 2 types of pancreatitis:

• Acute – only lasts a few days
• Chronic – lasts a long time (up to a few years)

Both types are serious and can cause complications. Pancreatitis can damage your pancreas permanently. But there are medicines that can help control your pain and help you lead a normal life.","The symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:

• Pain in your upper abdomen that spreads to your back
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Fever
• Rapid heart rate

People who have chronic pancreatitis may also experience abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. They may also have the following symptoms:

• High blood sugar levels
• Unintended weight loss
• Diarrhea
• Greasy or oily stools
• Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)

Sometimes people with chronic pancreatitis don’t have symptoms until they have complications.

If you have any of the above symptoms, call your doctor right away. Left untreated, pancreatitis can cause can complications that can be fatal.","There are a number of factors that can cause pancreatitis. The most common causes are:

• Gallstones (digestive fluids that become solid and form stones in the gallbladder)
• Heavy alcohol use
• Genetic disorders of the pancreas
• Certain medicines

• Smoking
• High levels of triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood)
• High levels of parathyroid hormone in the blood (called hyperparathyroidism)
• High levels of calcium in the blood (called hypercalcemia)
• Cancer of the pancreas
• Cystic fibrosis
• A family history of pancreatitis
• Abdominal surgery
• Injury to the abdomen

In some cases, doctors don’t know what causes pancreatitis.","Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you about your symptoms. He or she may do lab tests on samples of your blood or stool. They may also do imaging tests to look for inflammation or other signs of pancreatitis. This could include an ultrasound, which uses sound waves to build a picture of what your organs look like. It could also include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computerized tomography (CT) scan.","You can’t prevent pancreatitis, but there are steps you can take to reduce the risk that you will develop it. These include:

• Maintain a healthy lifestyle or lose weight, if needed. By keeping your body at a healthy weight, you can make your pancreas work better and reduce some risk factors for pancreatitis. These include gallstones, obesity, and diabetes. Eat a balanced, low-fat diet and exercise regularly.
• Avoid alcohol. Heavy alcohol use is one of the leading causes of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Talk to your doctor if you need help to stop drinking.
• Don’t smoke. Smoking is a risk factor for pancreatitis. Your risk goes up even more if you smoke and drink alcohol. Talk to your doctor if you need help to stop smoking.","If you have acute pancreatitis, you may need to stay in the hospital for a few days. There you can get intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicine to relieve pain. Most mild cases of pancreatitis clear up with treatment and rest.

If you have a more severe case of pancreatitis, you may need other treatment. This treatment would depend on the cause of the pancreatitis but could include:

• Gallbladder removal. If you have gallstones, you may need to have your gallbladder removed.
• Other procedures. If you have an abscess or pseudocyst that is infected, your doctor may need to drain it. He or she can remove damaged tissue from your pancreas if that is needed. They can also do other procedures to treat problems with the pancreatic and bile ducts.

If you have chronic pancreatitis, your treatment plan will help relieve pain, improve how well your pancreas works, and manage complications. It may include:

• A low-fat diet
• Medicine to relieve pain
• Insulin to help with high blood sugar levels
• Enzyme tablets (pills that help you digest food)
• Vitamins if your body doesn’t absorb nutrients well

It is also possible that someone with chronic pancreatitis would need surgery. This could help relieve pressure or a blockage in a pancreatic duct. Surgery could also be used to remove a damaged or infected part of your pancreas.

People who have pancreatitis should not drink alcohol or smoke. Some people develop diabetes or cancer of the pancreas because of the damage caused by chronic pancreatitis. These conditions need separate treatment.","Pancreatitis can be an ongoing disease. Your symptoms may get worse or go away for a while, then come back. You may feel depressed, angry, or frustrated. Chronic pain may make it hard for you to do your daily activities. Talk to your doctor about ways to manage these challenges.

To help manage your pancreatitis, you should:

• Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully.
• Work with your doctor to plan a healthy, low-fat diet.
• Quit smoking and stop drinking alcohol. Talk to your doctor about ways to quit.
• Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. Pancreatitis can cause dehydration.
• If chronic pancreatitis is causing depression, talk to your doctor. It may help to take medicine for depression and/or to talk with a counselor about how you feel.
• Develop a list of goals to improve your quality of life, such as sleeping better or exercising. To reduce stress, learn relaxation exercises.","• What types of medicines treat pancreatitis, and what are the side effects?

313,Panic Disorder and Panic Attacks,https://familydoctor.org/condition/panic-disorder/,"Panic disorder is a condition in which a person has episodes of intense fear or anxiety that occur suddenly, often without warning. Suppose one day you’re getting out of your car to go to work. Suddenly, your chest feels tight. Your heart races. You begin to feel dizzy and faint. You start to choke. You feel as if you could be dying. Was it all in your head? No. Most likely, you had a panic attack.

Panic attacks can last from minutes to hours. They may occur only occasionally or frequently. The cause, or trigger, for these attacks may not be obvious. Panic attacks can lead to phobias if they aren’t treated.

A phobia is an extreme, unreasonable fear in response to something specific. There are lots of different phobias. These include fear of crowds, bridges, snakes, spiders, heights, open places, or social embarrassment.

A phobia is considered a problem only when it keeps you from living a normal life. An example is being afraid to leave home because you are afraid of one of the things listed above.","Panic attacks are associated with physical symptoms that include:

• Shaking or trembling
• Feeling that your heart is pounding or racing
• Sweating
• Chest pain or discomfort
• Shortness of breath
• Feeling that you are choking
• Nausea
• Cramping
• Dizziness or weakness
• An out-of-body feeling
• Tingling or numbness in your hands, arms, feet or legs
• Chills or hot flashes
• Sense of unreality or dreamlike sensations

A person may also have an extreme fear of losing control, going crazy, or dying during a panic attack. It is very rare for a person to have all these symptoms at once. However, the presence of at least 4 symptoms strongly suggests that a person has panic disorder.

Many of the symptoms that occur during a panic attack are the same as the symptoms of diseases of the heart, lungs, intestines, or nervous system. The similarities between panic disorder and other diseases may add to the person’s fear and anxiety during and after a panic attack. For example, you may believe that you are having a heart attack.

Just the fear of having a panic attack is often enough to trigger the symptoms. This is the basis for a condition called agoraphobia. A person who has agoraphobia finds it difficult to leave home (or another safe area) because he or she is afraid of having a panic attack in public or not having an easy way to escape if the symptoms start.",Doctors do not know what causes panic disorder. Some believe that it could be linked to genetics (runs in families). It could also simply be your body’s response to major stress.,"Many people who have panic attacks don’t seek medical care because of embarrassment. They may also fear seeking medical attention or fear taking medicine. If you have panic attacks, it is very important to seek medical care and discuss your problem with your doctor.

After you have been evaluated, your doctor will be able to tell you if your panic attacks are related to panic disorder or are caused by another problem. If you have more than 4 panic attacks and you are in constant fear of having another, you may be diagnosed with panic disorder. Simple treatments are available to help control panic attacks and panic disorder.",You can’t prevent panic disorder because doctors aren’t sure what causes it. But you may be able to prevent a panic attack by knowing your triggers. Your doctor can help with that. He or she can help make sure your panic attacks don’t become worse or more frequent. It’s also a good idea to be physically active. Getting exercise is a known stress reliever and may also guard you against panic attacks.,"The two most common ways to treat panic disorder are through counseling and through medicine. Several kinds of counseling are very effective in treating panic attacks and panic disorder. You can ask your doctor about the different kinds of counseling that are available. Counseling does not work as fast as medicine, but it can be just as effective. The combination of both counseling and medicine seems to be an effective treatment for panic attacks and panic disorder. Relaxation, meditation, or breathing exercises may also be beneficial.

There are several medicines that can make panic attacks less severe or stop them altogether.

Antidepressants are effective in preventing anxiety and panic attacks. Often, they stop the attacks. You don’t have to be depressed for them to help. Side effects are usually mild. Antidepressants will not make you lose control or change your personality. These medicines can be used for as long as necessary, even for years.

Anti-anxiety medicines are another useful medication for panic disorder. As their name suggests, these medicines give relief from fear and anxiety. They should be used only for a short period of time (a few weeks to a few months) unless you absolutely can’t function without them. Never suddenly stop taking either of these medicines. If you need to stop, these medicines should be tapered off over several weeks. This should only be done under your doctor’s supervision.

How long treatment continues depends on you. Stopping panic attacks completely is a reasonable goal. Your doctor will design a treatment plan just for you. A treatment period lasting at least 6 to 9 months is usually recommended. Some people taking medicine for panic disorder can stop treatment after only a short time. Other people need to continue treatments over a long period of time, or even for their lifetime.","Panic attacks are often unpredictable, even after your diagnosis. They can make you feel helpless. In addition to your treatment plan, consider these lifestyle changes to help reduce risk of a panic attack.

• Exercise. Physical activity can help you minimize stress. It can also calm your mind.
• Sleep. Not getting enough rest can leave you groggy. It can also cause you to be more emotional. This may make you more prone to anxiety and an attack.
• Skip the alcohol, caffeine, smoking, and any recreational drugs. Any of these can trigger a panic attack or make it worse.
• Join a support group. It’s always good to know you’re not alone. Many times, simply talking about your panic disorder can create a feeling that you have power over it.","• What is causing my panic disorder?
• What treatment is best for me?
• Should I take a medicine?
• Will I have to take medicine the rest of my life?
• Is there any kind of therapy I should try?
• How long will I have to be in therapy?
• I’m afraid to leave my house. What should I do?

314,Paraphimosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/paraphimosis/,"Paraphimosis is a serious condition that can happen only to people who have penises and who haven’t been circumcised. (Circumcision is when the foreskin of the penis is removed, usually in the first few days after birth.) Paraphimosis happens when the foreskin gets stuck behind the head of the penis. It can’t be pulled back down into a normal position.

Paraphimosis can happen to any uncircumcised penis. It is most common in younger and older people. It is a medical emergency and needs to be treated quickly.","The main symptoms of paraphimosis include:

• Not being able to pull the foreskin back to its normal position
• Swelling of the end of the penis
• Discomfort and pain

• Redness and tenderness
• Trouble urinating

If you can’t pull your foreskin over the head of your penis, you should call your doctor right away.","Uncircumcised people sometimes pull the foreskin back during sex, when they go to the bathroom, or when they clean their penises. Doctors and nurses might pull the foreskin back when they examine the penis or put in a catheter.

Sometimes you, a doctor, or a nurse might forget to pull the foreskin back down. If the foreskin is left behind the head of the penis too long, your penis might swell so much that the foreskin is trapped behind it.

• An infection. This can happen when the area is not washed well.
• An injury to the area. Injury can happen from vigorous sex, a piercing, scarring from repeated infection, or an insect or spider bite.
• A circumcision that wasn’t done correctly.
• Diabetes, which can cause chronic inflammation of the penis and foreskin.",There are no tests required to diagnose paraphimosis. Your doctor will do a physical exam and look at your or your child’s penis to diagnose it.,"The only way to completely prevent paraphimosis from happening is by being circumcised. If you are not circumcised, you can still avoid paraphimosis by:

• Always pulling the foreskin back down to its natural position. This could be after having sex, going to the bathroom, or cleaning yourself.
• Never leaving the foreskin behind the head of your penis for any longer than you need to.
• Checking to be sure that the foreskin is covering the head of your penis after a catheter is put into your bladder.","The first thing your doctor will do is treat the swelling. This can be done by pressing your penis with a hand, wrapping your penis in a tight bandage, or using ice. After the swelling has gone away, your doctor should be able to pull the foreskin back down. If the foreskin remains stuck, your doctor might need to make a small cut in the trapped foreskin to loosen it. In some cases, your doctor may need to do a circumcision.","If paraphimosis is diagnosed and treated quickly, you shouldn’t have any other problems. If the condition is left untreated, it can cause complications. It could disrupt blood flow to the tip of the penis. Though rare, this could lead to damage to the penis tip, gangrene, or loss of the penis tip.","• What is the best treatment for me?
• How long will it take before the swelling in my penis goes down?
• How long will it be before the cut in my foreskin heals?
• Is there anything I can do at home to stop this from happening?
• Is it safe to have sex soon after I’m treated?

315,Parkinson’s Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/parkinsons-disease/,"Parkinson’s disease is a kind of movement disorder. It affects the nervous system and causes problems with muscle movement. It is a chronic and progressive disease. This means it doesn’t go away, and the symptoms get worse over time.

Some nerve cells in the brain make a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine sends signals to help coordinate movement and coordination. In people who have Parkinson’s disease, these cells die or do not work properly. The level of dopamine produced decreases. This affects the person’s ability to control their movement normally.

There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms.","The 4 primary motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are:

• Tremor (shaking or trembling) of the hands, arms, legs, jaw, or face. Tremors caused by Parkinson’s may be barely noticeable at first. They get worse over time. Tremors tend to get worse when the person is at rest and better when the person moves. The tremors may affect one side of the body more than the other.
• Slowed movements (bradykinesia). Over time, a person who has Parkinson’s may begin to move slowly and take a long time to perform simple tasks. This includes getting out of a chair, buttoning a shirt, or cutting food.
• Stiff muscles (also called rigidity). Over time, muscles in the body may contract and become stiff, which makes it hard to move them. This can make it difficult for a person to do simple tasks, including feeding themselves, standing up, or walking.
• Posture and balance problems. Parkinson’s disease can make it hard for a person to stand up or sit up straight. It can also cause balance problems when sitting, standing, or walking. This can lead to falls.

• Difficulty moving your feet. Your feet feel like they are glued to the floor. It feels impossible to step forward.
• Handwriting shrinkage. The slowed movements cause problems with repetitive actions. This can make handwriting get smaller over time.
• Mask-like expression. Your face may look less expressive than normal.
• Quick movements. Some people with Parkinson’s experience movements that are too quick instead of too slow.

There are also several non-motor symptoms that patients with Parkinson’s experience. These include:

• Loss of smell
• Constipation
• Mood disorders
• Sleep disturbances
• Excessive saliva
• Weight loss or gain
• Vision or dental problems
• Fatigue or loss of energy

Some people with Parkinson’s develop cognitive issues. This includes problems with memory, confusion, and slowed thinking. In some cases, they develop Parkinson’s-related dementia. This is a separate form of dementia that is unique to Parkinson’s patients.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes Parkinson’s disease. In some people, genetics seem to play a role. These people could have inherited the genes for Parkinson’s disease from a family member. Or they could have a gene mutation. Environmental factors may also play a role. For example, long-term exposure to certain toxins, such as pesticides, may increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease. You have a higher risk of developing Parkinson’s if you are over age 60. Men get it more often than women.","There is not a test that can confirm you have Parkinson’s. You must experience at least 2 of the 4 main motor symptoms before your doctor will consider it. They will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam. If your doctor thinks you have Parkinson’s disease, they may refer you to a neurologist. The neurologist will have you complete tasks that use your nervous system. These are intended to test your balance, muscles, gait, and agility. They may also do imaging tests, such as a CT or MRI scan, to rule out other conditions.",There is no known way to prevent or avoid getting Parkinson’s disease.,"There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease. But medicines can help control the symptoms. They often produce very good results, especially in the earlier stages of the disease. The most common medicine used to treat Parkinson’s disease is carbidopa-levodopa. This helps increase the amount of dopamine in your brain. Other classes of medicines, such as dopamine agonists or anticholinergics, can also help. Your doctor will recommend the best treatment for you.

In addition to medicine, your doctor may also recommend exercise or physical therapy. These can help you control your movements better. In some cases, surgery can also help relieve symptoms. Deep brain stimulation has been approved to treat many stages of Parkinson’s. Electrodes are inserted in your brain, and electrical impulses are sent to stimulate it.","Living with a chronic illness can be frustrating and discouraging. Parkinson’s will gradually get worse. You will eventually have trouble with simple tasks. These include walking, talking, and eating, among many others. It is common for people with Parkinson’s to develop depression. Antidepressant medicines are available and can help with your depression symptoms. If you’ve been feeling persistently sad or hopeless, call your doctor. There is help available.

Joining a support group can be particularly helpful for Parkinson’s patients. It is helpful to have people around you who know exactly what you’re going through. It is also a good idea to eat a healthy diet, exercise, and stay as active as you can.","• Could Parkinson’s disease be a sign of another condition?

316,Paronychia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/paronychia/,"Paronychia is a skin infection around the fingernails or toenails. It usually affects the skin at the base (cuticle) or up the sides of the nail. There are two types of paronychia:

• Acute: comes on suddenly and may not last long; it usually occurs on fingers.
• Chronic: lasts longer and may occur on your fingers or toes. It either doesn’t get better or keeps coming back.

Paronychia can happen to adults and children. Usually it isn’t serious and can be treated at home.

Typically, paronychia begins with pain, swelling and redness around the base or the sides of the nail. Acute paronychia can cause pus-filled pockets (abscesses) to form.

Chronic paronychia may cause the cuticle to break down. This type of paronychia may eventually cause the nail to separate from the skin. The nail may become thick, hard, and deformed.

Paronychia caused by bacteria can get worse quickly. Fungus-caused paronychia typically gets worse slowly over time.",null,"Paronychia happens when the skin around the nail gets irritated or injured. Germs get into the skin and cause an infection. These germs can be bacteria or a fungus.

Often, the skin is injured because of biting, chewing, or picking at the nails. It can also be caused by pulling hangnails or sucking on fingers. An ingrown toenail can also cause paronychia.

Moisture allows certain germs, such as candida (a type of fungus) and bacteria to grow. People whose hands may be wet for long periods of time are at higher risk for chronic paronychia. These may include bartenders, dishwashers, food handlers, or housecleaners. Chronic paronychia may also be caused by irritant dermatitis, a condition that makes skin red and itchy. Once the skin is irritated, germs can take hold and cause an infection.

Paronychia is more common in adult women and in people who have diabetes. People who have weak immune systems are also at higher risk of getting paronychia. This includes people who must take medicine after having an organ transplant or people who are infected with HIV.",Your doctor can diagnose paronychia with a simple physical exam. Special tests aren’t usually necessary. Your doctor may want to send a sample of fluid or pus to a laboratory. There they can identify the bacteria or fungus that is causing the infection.,"You can avoid chronic paronychia by keeping your hands dry and free from chemicals. Wear gloves when working with water or harsh chemicals. Change socks at least every day, and do not wear the same shoes for two days in a row. This allows them to dry out completely.","The best away to avoid acute paronychia is to take good care of your nails.

• Avoid injuring your nails and fingertips.
• Don’t bite or pick your nails.
• Keep your nails trimmed and smooth.
• Avoid cutting nails too short.
• Don’t scrape or trim your cuticles, as this can injure the skin.
• Use clean nail clippers or scissors.

Paronychia treatment methods depend on how severe the infection is.

If you have acute paronychia, soaking the infected nail in warm water 3 to 4 times a day can help reduce pain and swelling. It should heal up in a few days.

If the infection is very painful, doesn’t get better with home care, or has a pus-filled abscess, you may need to see your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics if your paronychia is caused by bacteria. He or she may prescribe antifungal medicines if your infection is caused by a fungus.

If you have an abscess, your doctor may need to drain it. Your doctor will numb the area, separate the skin from the base or sides of the nail, and drain the pus.

If you have chronic paronychia, it is important to keep your nails dry and protect them from harsh chemicals. You may need to wear gloves or use a skin-drying cream to protect skin from moisture. You may need an antifungal medicine or antibiotic, depending on what is causing the infection.

Paronychia caused by a fungus can be hard to get rid of. Be patient and follow your doctor’s recommendations. If the infection does not clear up, be sure to tell your doctor.","Most of the time, paronychia treatment is effective. But sometimes complications can happen.

Rarely, paronychia can cause permanent damage to your nail. If you have diabetes, there’s a risk that paronychia could spread to deeper tissues and bones, or into the bloodstream and other parts of the body. In extreme cases of deep infection, paronychia can result in the loss of fingers, toes, or limbs.

Be sure to contact your doctor if:

• Treatment doesn’t help your symptoms
• You have a fever or chills

317,Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/patellofemoral-pain-syndrome/,Patellofemoral pain is a painful knee condition. It’s sometimes called “runner’s knee.” It has to do with the way your kneecap (patella) moves on the groove of your thigh bone (femur). It’s most common in people who participate in high-impact activities that include jumping and running. The syndrome mostly occurs in teens and young adults. It’s also more common in females than males.,Symptoms include pain under and around your kneecap. The pain can get worse when you’re active. It also can get worse when you sit for a long time. This condition can occur in one or both knees. It can lasts weeks and months.,"The exact cause of patellofemoral pain isn’t known. However, doctors think it’s related to how your leg is aligned. If your hip and knee muscles don’t support your kneecap the right way, that may cause this pain, too.","Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms. They will do a physical exam. This might involve pressing on your knee and moving your leg around. You may need an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI to look at your bones and soft tissue.","The condition can’t be prevented or avoided. However, certain things can reduce pain and discomfort. This includes restricting your activity, using over-the-counter pain medicines when needed, and physical therapy.","There are a variety of treatment options that can be combined.

• Wear the right shoes and shoe inserts. Proper shoes can help knee pain. An arch support insert from a shoe store can be helpful. It’s less expensive than a custom-made support or brace.
• Tape your knee or wear a brace. Your doctor can show you how to tape your knee. They also can recommend a brace. If you wear these items, you may be able to start exercising again. But talk with your doctor before beginning any exercise plan.
• Take over-the-counter pain medicines. These include acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol), ibuprofen (one brand names: Advil), or naproxen sodium (one brand name: Aleve). Ask your doctor which one is best for you.
• Ice your knee. After you exercise, ice your knee for 10 to 20 minutes. This can ease pain and speed healing.

Surgery may be necessary in some cases. A surgeon will make a tiny incision in your knee. They will insert a thin, flexible tube attached to a camera into the incision. The camera allows them to see the damage inside your knee and make repairs with special instruments. In severe cases, your surgeon can realign the angle of the kneecap.","Living with patellofemoral can be frustrating. That’s because the pain interferes with activities you enjoy. Focus on relieving your pain, including:

• Take a break from physical activity that causes pounding on your legs. This includes running, volleyball, or basketball. Switch to swimming or another low-impact activity. Nonimpact elliptical trainers are helpful. That’s because these machines support your body weight and put less stress on your knees. Slowly return to your normal sports when your knee feels better.
• Talk to a physical therapist about exercises you can do at home. Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist. This specially trained therapist can show you how to do exercises to help your knee, build stability, and improve your form while exercising. They will show you how to do the exercises while you’re in their office. You’ll then need to do these exercises at home. The therapist will give you a handout about each exercise to remind you how to do them.","• Is this condition permanent or temporary?
• Once the condition goes away, will it come back again?
• It this condition hereditary?
• Does this condition happen in teens more than kids and adults?

318,Pelvic Floor Disorders,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pelvic-floor-disorders/,"A group of muscles and connective tissues make up your pelvic floor. When your pelvic floor weakens, it can cause problems. You may have bladder- or bowel-control problems (incontinence). It can cause constipation or painful urination. A weakened pelvic floor can even cause pelvic organ prolapse (when an organ slips forward or down).","Symptoms of pelvic floor disorders vary. Pelvic floor disorders are commonly associated with women. But men can also have pelvic floor disorders.

There are many ways to tell that you may have pelvic floor disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Common symptoms include:

• Feeling of heaviness, fullness, pulling, or aching in the vagina that gets worse by the end of the day or during a bowel movement
• Seeing or feeling a “bulge” or “something coming out” of the vagina
• Having a hard time starting to urinate or completely emptying your bladder
• Having frequent urinary tract infections
• Leaking urine when you cough, laugh, or exercise
• Feeling an urgent or frequent need to urinate
• Feeling pain while urinating
• Leaking stool or having a hard time controlling gas
• Being constipated
• Having a hard time making it to the bathroom in time","There are many things that can damage your pelvic floor muscles. For women, childbirth is a common way those muscles lose their shape. Being overweight can also cause more stress on those muscles, pushing them out of shape. Or simply age can cause the muscles to wear down over time. This is especially true if you do not exercise them.","Your doctor will diagnose your pelvic floor disorder. After discussing your symptoms, they may perform a pelvic exam. During the exam, your doctor will check for muscle weakness.

Depending on the extent of your symptoms, your doctor may also order additional tests. Each of these can help define the level of weakness in your pelvic floor and how best to treat it. Some tests focus on rectal muscles. Other tests target how well your bladder and urethra are working.","Pelvic floor disorders are caused by strain. This can be strain over time or strain from a specific event. So sometimes, there may be nothing you can do to prevent it.

In other situations, you may be able to prevent pelvic floor disorders from happening. Or at the very least, you may be able to ensure that they don’t happen prematurely. Being proactive about pelvic floor disorders can also limit their severity.

To help prevent pelvic floor disorders, you should:

• Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight can put strain on your pelvic floor muscles.
• Exercise your pelvic muscles. These exercises, called Kegels, can strengthen your muscles. This can help with future incontinence.
• Decrease constipation. Eat foods with fiber that can help prevent constipation. Avoiding constipation can help with pelvic muscle strain.
• Learn to lift the right way. Use your legs to lift heavy items. Avoid using your back or abdomen muscles.","There are surgical and non-surgical treatments for pelvic floor disorders. Your treatment plan will depend on the severity of your disorder.

These treatments are the least invasive. They can help mild forms of pelvic floor disorders.

• Kegel exercises. These exercises help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Exercising these muscles can help incontinence, but do not correct organ prolapse.
• Prescription medications. There are medicines that can help with bladder control and prevent frequent bowel movements. Relieving these symptoms is often seen as a priority for people who suffer from pelvic floor disorders.
• Injections. If your main symptom of pelvic floor disorders is urinary incontinence, you may be able to solve it with injections. Your doctor can inject bulking agents to thicken tissues. This helps close the bladder opening.
• Vaginal pessary. A vaginal pessary is a plastic device that fits into your vagina to help support your uterus, vagina, bladder, or rectum. It helps with urinary incontinence and even prolapse.

If you don’t get relief of symptoms using non-surgical methods, you may need to consider surgery. There are several types of surgery used to correct pelvic floor disorders. The type of surgery you have will depend on how severely your pelvic floor is damaged. It will also depend on your symptoms. Surgeries for urinary incontinence focus on adding support for the bladder. Correcting prolapse involves surgery to build back a support system for your pelvic floor. Bowel incontinence may call for surgery to repair your sphincter muscle.","Managing incontinence every day can be a challenge. There are products to help you with daily hygiene. There are absorbent pads, disposable underwear, reusable underwear with built-in pads, and more. You have choices, even if your incontinence is moderate to severe. You can use these products in the short-term as you work to rehabilitate your pelvic floor muscles. You can also use them long-term as a solution for your mild or moderate incontinence.

Know that it is also important to care for your skin when you are incontinent. Change soiled pads or briefs as soon as possible. This will minimize the amount of wetness against your skin. Keep your skin clean and dry. Wash your genital area with mild soap and water when you shower.

If your incontinence prevents you from having dry skin most of the time, you may need to use a barrier cream. These creams can protect you from rashes and irritation.

You may feel alone in your battle with incontinence. You should know that millions of men and women share your struggle.","• What kind of pelvic floor disorder do I have?

319,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive organs. This includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Left untreated, PID can damage a woman’s reproductive organs. It can cause trouble getting pregnant, problems during pregnancy, and long-term pelvic pain.","Pelvic inflammatory disease causes different symptoms in different women. These may include:

• A dull pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen
• Vaginal discharge that is yellow or green and may have an unpleasant smell
• Irregular menstrual periods, such as extra-long periods, spotting, or cramps throughout the month
• Chills, fever, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting
• Pain during sex
• Low back pain
• Painful urination

Some women who have PID don’t experience symptoms and don’t know they have the disease. This is why it is important to have routine checkups and testing.

If you have the above symptoms, or if you think you have been exposed to an STI, call your doctor. The sooner you see your doctor, the better. Waiting can allow the infection to spread and cause more pain and damage.","Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by different types of bacteria. Many times, it’s caused by bacteria from a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The two most common STIs that cause PID are chlamydia and gonorrhea. But PID can be caused by normal bacteria found in the vagina, too. You can get PID if the bacteria move from your vagina into your reproductive organs.

There are several ways women can get PID. The most common way is by having sex with a person who has an STI. These diseases are carried in the semen and other body fluids of infected people. During sexual contact, the germs spread to the woman’s cervix. The germs can also infect the glands at the opening of the vagina, the urethra (passageway for urine), or the anus.

Sometimes PID can occur after the cervix is treated due to an abnormal Pap smear or after the insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD). However, that’s uncommon. Rarely, PID can occur as a result of giving birth or having a miscarriage, abortion, or procedure to take a sample from the inside of the womb for laboratory testing.

Additionally, the same things that put you at risk for STIs also put you at risk for PID. Your risk for PID is higher if you:

• Have had an STI
• Have had PID before
• Are a sexually active woman younger than 25 years of age
• Have had multiple sexual partners
• Have unsafe sexual habits
• Douche (this can flush the bacteria up into your genital tract)","There is no single test for PID. Your doctor will diagnose the condition based on your medical history, your symptoms, and a pelvic exam. This exam can help him or her tell if any of your reproductive organs are tender. Your doctor may swab the area for a sample and have the sample tested for STIs. He or she may test for a urinary tract infection or other conditions that can cause pelvic pain. He or she might also do imaging tests, such as ultrasound. This uses sound waves to create pictures of your organs. It can help your doctor look for signs of PID.","Many cases of pelvic inflammatory disease can be prevented in the same way that STIs are prevented. The only way to avoid an STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.

If you’re sexually active, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by:

• Using condoms.Even though the condom will not prevent 100% of STIs, it will greatly reduce your chances of getting infected. Remember, only a condom can provide some protection against STIs. Other forms of birth control don’t provide this protection.
• Getting tested.Make sure you and your partner are tested for STIs before you have sex. Tell each other the results.
• Limiting sexual partners.Your risk of getting an STI increases with the number of sexual partners you have.
• Remaining monogamous.This means having sex with only one partner.
• Not abusing alcohol or drugs.Drinking too much or using drugs can lead to risky behavior. It can increase your risk of being exposed to STIs.
• Not douching. Douching removes normal bacteria from your vagina that help to fight infections. It also helps bacteria travel up to other areas of the reproductive tract where they can cause infection.","Pelvic inflammatory disease can be treated, especially if it’s diagnosed early. It can usually be cured with antibiotics. It’s very important that you take all of your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to, even if your symptoms go away. If you don’t take all the medicine, your symptoms may get worse. A few days after you start taking the medicine, your doctor may want to see you again for a checkup.

The sooner your PID is treated, the better. The longer PID is left untreated, the more damage it can cause, and the more likely there will be complications.

Hospitalization may be recommended if you’re very sick with PID. It may also be needed if you’re pregnant, are under the age of 18, or have HIV.

If you’re treated for pelvic inflammatory disease, especially if it’s caused by an STI, your partner must also be treated. Unless your partner is treated, you may be infected again. Making good choices about sexual contact is important. If you think you might have PID, talk to your family doctor right away.","Early and complete treatment can help prevent complications of pelvic inflammatory disease. However, if PID isn’t treated, it can cause permanent damage to your internal organs. Scar tissue can form in the fallopian tubes and around the abdomen. This tissue can prevent pregnancy. It can also cause the pregnancy to form outside the uterus. This is called a tubal or ectopic pregnancy. Scarring can cause pain that lasts for months or even years. Occasionally, the effects of PID can be so severe that surgery is required to remove pus, get rid of scar tissue, or remove damaged organs.

PID is more likely to come back if you’re exposed to STIs again. Each time you have PID, it causes more damage and a greater possibility of complications.","• What is the likely cause of my pelvic inflammatory disease?
• Do I need any tests?
• What do my test results mean?
• What treatment option do you recommend?
• Does my sexual partner need to be treated too?
• Is it safe for me to have sex now, or do I need to wait until after treatment?
• Is it safe for me to try to get pregnant before I finish treatment?
• Will I have trouble getting pregnant?
• Do I have scar tissue or other damage to my organs?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

320,Peptic Ulcer Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/peptic-ulcer-disease/,A peptic ulcer is a sore or raw area in the lining of the stomach. It also can occur near the top of the small intestine. This area of the small intestine is called the duodenum. The lining is damaged by the acids your body uses to digest food.,"The most common symptom is a burning pain in your stomach. It usually lasts for a few minutes to a few hours. It comes and goes for days or weeks at a time. The burning typically occurs between meals and at night. Small ulcers may cause no symptoms.

• A feeling of fullness
• Difficulty drinking as much liquid as usual
• Hunger or an empty feeling in your stomach after you eat
• Mild nausea
• Stomach pain that wakes you up at night

• Bloating
• Burping
• Poor appetite
• Bloody or dark stools
• Chest pain
• Fatigue
• Weight loss
• Vomiting

• Bleeding (this occurs from a broken blood vessel in the small intestine)
• Perforation (tear)
• A blockage
• Peritonitis (infection)","The main cause is the bacterial infection, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Another common cause is long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This includes aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. In rare cases, the disease can be caused by cancerous and noncancerous tumors. A less common cause is a rare disorder called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.","Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will ask you questions about your medical history. Tell your doctor if you take aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen frequently. Your doctor will look for stomach bloating. They will listen to sounds in your stomach with a stethoscope. Your doctor will tap your stomach to check for pain.

Your doctor may schedule a special procedure to look at your stomach. This is called an endoscopy. For this procedure, you’ll be given medicine to relax. The medicine may make you fall asleep. The doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube down your throat. A tiny camera on the end of the tube displays the lining of your stomach and duodenum. The doctor may take a sample of your stomach lining (a biopsy). This is done to test for H. pylori. Blood, breath, and stool sample testing can also be used to check for H. pylori.","Stress and spicy foods don’t cause ulcers. However, they can make them worse. Smoking and alcohol can cause a peptic ulcer. Men should limit alcohol to no more than 2 drinks per day. Women should have no more than 1 drink per day. Talk to your doctor if you take aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen regularly.","Your doctor may begin by prescribing medicine. Your doctor may suggest other treatments for other causes.

If you have H. pylori, your doctor will treat the infection with “triple therapy.” This is a combination of 2 antibiotics and bismuth subsalicylate (one brand name: Pepto-Bismol). H. pylori can be stubborn. Take all your medicine as prescribed.

Your doctor may recommend medicines to neutralize your stomach acid. This will protect the lining in your stomach, too. These include:

• Protein pump inhibitors. This includes esomeprazole (one brand name: Nexium) or lansoprazole (one brand name: Prevacid).
• Histamine receptor blockers. This includes famotidine (one brand name: Pepcid).
• Cytoprotective agents. This includes sucralfate (one brand name: Carafate).

If NSAIDs cause your ulcer, you may need to stop or reduce the amount you take. You may need to switch to another type of medicine for pain.","Most ulcers heal within about 8 weeks. Peptic ulcers come and go. You have to do what you can to reduce your risk. If you smoke or chew tobacco, ask your doctor about how to quit. Eat a well-balanced diet. Avoid foods that cause discomfort. These include alcohol, coffee, caffeinated soda, fatty foods, chocolate, and spicy foods. Avoid eating late at night. Talk to your doctor about alternatives to NSAIDs. Take all medicines with plenty of water.","• What other pain medicine can I take besides aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen??

321,Perimenopause | Symptoms and treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/perimenopause/,"Perimenopause is the natural transition leading up to menopause, and it can bring a wide range of physical and emotional changes. Understanding perimenopause symptoms and treatment options can help you feel more prepared and supported. From hormone shifts to sleep problems or mood swings, knowing what to expect can make this stage of life easier to manage.

Perimenopause is a stage in a woman’s reproductive years. It’s a sign that a woman is getting closer to menopause. Menopause is the time in a woman’s life when she stops having periods and can no longer become pregnant. Perimenopause generally starts in a woman’s 40s and commonly lasts several years. However, it can vary for every woman. It’s important to remember that a woman can still become pregnant during perimenopause. Birth control would still be important to use during this phase of your life if you want to prevent a pregnancy.","There are many symptoms a woman will not see during perimenopause. For example, estrogen (the female hormone) will fluctuate. And a woman’s ovaries will slowly stop releasing eggs (meaning you are not ovulating). Other symptoms that you will notice include some that are similar to menopause, including:

• Hot flashes (feeling intensely warm or hot from the inside out)
• Sleep disturbances
• Mood changes
• Vaginal dryness (This may cause pain during sexual intercourse.)
• Longer, shorter, or skipped periods (During the early phase of perimenopause, you may see changes of 7 days or more between periods. Once you reach menopause, the difference is 60 days or more.)
• Heavy or light flow menstrual flow
• Bladder problems (urinary infections or leakage)
• Decreased fertility
• Changes in sexual desire or arousal
• Bone loss
• Higher cholesterol levels

While irregular periods are normal during perimenopause, talk to your doctor if your period is extremely heavy (you are changing pads or tampons every couple of hours). Also, talk to your doctor if your bleeding lasts longer than seven days, if you bleed between periods, or if you are getting your periods less than 21 days apart.

Living with perimenopause can be frustrating at times. Many of the symptoms appear without warning, including hot flashes, mood changes, and sleep disturbances. Irregular periods or periods with a heavier flow can be a difficult adjustment. And if you are trying to prevent a pregnancy, you have to be absolutely certain you have reached menopause before giving up birth control. Menopause occurs when you have gone through 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period.

• Family history
• Hysterectomy (surgical removal of all your female reproductive organs)
• Cancer treatment (chemotherapy and radiation)
• Some synthetic hormones used to treat certain medical conditions","Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms. They will consider your age, your family history, and your menstrual history to determine if you are experiencing perimenopause. A blood test can check your hormone levels. However, your doctor may not order this unless your symptoms are occurring at an unusually young age.","It cannot be prevented or avoided. However, not smoking can delay an early onset.","Perimenopause is often treated with prescription hormone medicine or nothing at all. Hormones treat the symptoms of perimenopause. They are offered in pill form, as a cream, or a skin patch. Your doctor will typically start you on the lowest possible dosage. This approach is called hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It is a risk factor for certain types of female cancers. Certain over-the-counter vaginal products can relieve dryness. Water-based vaginal dryness products are best. Certain prescription medicines can treat urinary incontinence (leaking). Talk to your doctor if you are having significant mood changes. They may treat it with prescription antidepressant medicine.","Some common healthy practices can help with symptoms. This includes eating healthy foods, exercising, getting enough sleep, reducing your alcohol consumption, and practicing relaxation exercises.","• Is increased pain with my period normal during perimenopause?

322,Peripheral Arterial Disease and Claudication,https://familydoctor.org/condition/peripheral-arterial-disease-and-claudication/,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a problem with blood flow in the arteries, especially those in the legs. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the muscles and organs throughout your body. When you have diseased arteries, they become narrow or blocked. If you have PAD, your arms, and more commonly your legs, don’t get enough blood flow. The most common complaint of people who have PAD is claudication.

Claudication is pain in the calf, thigh, or hip muscle that occurs after you have walked a certain distance, such as a block or more. The pain stops after you rest for a while. Each time the pain occurs, it takes about the same amount of time for the pain to go away after you stop walking.","Many times, you will have no symptoms of PAD or your symptoms will be mild. Claudication is the most common symptom. Other symptoms may include:

• Numb or weak legs
• Slow toenail growth
• Slow hair growth on legs and feet (or hair loss on legs and feet)
• Weak pulse or no pulse in your legs or feet
• Sores on your legs or feet that are slow to heal
• Feet or lower legs may feel cold
• Erectile dysfunction (in men)
• Lower legs may appear shiny or turn bluish

People with leg pain might think it’s from aging, arthritis, or a diabetes-related symptom. PAD can be dangerous if it’s not treated. If you notice pain in your legs while walking, ask your doctor about claudication and PAD.",The most common cause of narrow or blocked arteries is the buildup of fatty deposits inside them. This is called atherosclerosis. Claudication occurs because not enough blood is flowing to a muscle you are actively using.,"Your doctor may suspect that your arteries have narrowed and will check the pulses in arteries in your legs and feet. Your doctor will listen to the blood flow with a stethoscope or a small Doppler device. Your doctor may hear a noise, called a bruit, which can be a warning that there is a narrowed area in the artery. Blood pressure in your ankles can also be compared to blood pressure in your arms. This test is called an ankle-brachial index, or ABI. Your doctor may do some other tests to look into possible PAD. They may also do tests to see if arteries in other parts of your body have atherosclerosis.

If surgery might help treat the symptoms of claudication, your doctor may recommend an arteriogram. This is an X-ray taken after dye is injected into an artery. The dye study may show narrowing in an artery and provides a “map” for the doctor who will do the surgery.","Risk factors for PAD and claudication include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, and older age. Claudication is also more likely in people who already have atherosclerosis in other arteries, such as the arteries in the heart or brain. People who have claudication may have already had heart attacks or strokes.

PAD and claudication treatment

PAD and claudication are often treated with diet and exercise, and sometimes medicine. People who have PAD or claudication should not smoke. It is important to bring down high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar levels.

A walking program is very helpful. You should walk at least 4 times a week for 30 to 60 minutes each time. Walk until the pain is too uncomfortable to continue. Stop and rest until the pain goes away. Then start walking again. If you start a new exercise program, such as walking or stair climbing, begin by exercising slowly and gradually increase the time you spend exercising. You may see improvement in your symptoms within 2 months.

Medicine can help some people who have PAD and claudication. Ask your doctor if medicine is right for you.

If your arteries are badly blocked, you may need a procedure called angioplasty to open them up. During an angioplasty, a thin tube called a catheter is inserted into the artery. A small balloon on the tip of the catheter is inflated. This helps to open up the artery. The balloon is then deflated and removed. Sometimes a device called a stent (a small wire mesh tube) will be left in the artery. The stent will help hold the artery open. Angioplasty is normally done while you are awake.

If the narrow area of the artery is very long, you may need to have bypass surgery. For the surgery, your doctor will take a vein from another part of your body. The vein will be attached above and below the narrowed part of the artery. This lets the blood flow around the narrowed area. Sometimes a synthetic (manmade) graft is used instead of a vein.",null,"If you believe you could have PAD, it is important that you talk to you doctor right away. Being diagnosed with PAD indicates that you are also at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. Treatment and lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise can improve PAD symptoms. They can also decrease your likelihood for heart attack or stroke.","• What is the likely cause of my PAD/claudication?
• What lifestyle changes do I need to make at home to help relieve my symptoms?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? How do I get started?
• What treatment option is best for me? Will I need medicine? Surgery?

• Aspiration(draining) of the abscess using a needle
• CT scanof the neck
• Endoscopy(a small scope) to check if the airway is blocked",Quickly treating tonsillitis can reduce the chances of getting peritonsillar abscesses.,"Your doctor will need to remove the pus from the abscess. To do this, he or she will numb the skin around the abscess. Your doctor will either remove the pus with a needle or make a small cut in the abscess. Surgery to remove your tonsils (called a tonsillectomy) also is an option. You will probably only need surgery if you have had many tonsil infections or abscesses before.

Your pain and symptoms should get better after the pus is drained. Your doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics to make sure the infection goes away completely. He or she may also give you medicine to help relieve the pain.","The worst is over once a peritonsillar abscess is treated. If left untreated, you will be uncomfortable from the symptoms listed above. Over-the-counter pain relievers may help ease the discomfort.","• If I get tonsillitis, will I get a peritonsillar abscess?

324,Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/persistent-depressive-disorder/,"Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is chronic depression that lasts a long time. A person’s moods are generally affected for at least 2 years (1 year for children and adolescents). Their depression is usually mild or moderate, rather than severe. Most people who have PDD can’t recall when they first became depressed.

PDD is a common type of depression. It can begin in childhood or in adulthood. No one knows why. It appears to be more common in women. It used to be called dysthymic disorder or dysthymia.","The main symptom of PDD is a sad, low, or dark mood on most days. This lasts for at least 2 years. Children and teens with PDD can feel irritable instead of depressed. Their symptoms last for at least 1 year.

Other symptoms that happen much of the time include:

• Poor appetite or overeating
• Difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much
• Low self-esteem
• Poor concentration
• Low energy
• Fatigue
• Feelings of hopelessness

Most people who have PDD may have an episode of major depression at least once in their lives. Older people who have PDD find it difficult to care for themselves. They feel isolated and have medical illnesses

People who have PDD may have periods of normal moods that can last up to 2 months. Family members and friends may not even know that their loved one is depressed. This type of depression is mild. It may be difficult for a person to function at home, school, or work.","No one knows what causes PDD. It may be related to some changes in the brain that involve a chemical called serotonin. Serotonin helps your brain handle emotions and make judgments. Other medical problems and ongoing life stress may also play a role.

You may be at higher risk of developing PDD if you are a woman. It also tends to run in families. If a family member has it or another type of depression, you could be more likely to get it.","If you think you have PDD, discuss your concerns with your doctor. Your doctor will ask you questions to find out if you have depression and what type you have. Your doctor may ask you questions about your health and your symptoms. This may include how well you’re sleeping, if you feel tired a lot, and if you have trouble concentrating. Your doctor will also consider medical reasons that may cause you to feel depressed. These could be problems with your thyroid or a certain medicine you may be taking. Your doctor might order blood or urine tests to check for these or other causes.","In general, PDD and other forms of depression are conditions that cannot be prevented. There are lifestyle changes you can make that can boost your mood and minimize symptoms, including:

• Get enough sleep.
• Follow a healthy diet.
• Reduce or avoid your alcohol consumption.
• Do not take illegal drugs.
• Take medicines as prescribed by your doctor.
• Watch for changes in your PDD. Talk to your doctor about changes.
• Engage in activities that bring you enjoyment.
• Talk to someone you trust about how you feel.
• Be around people who are positive and uplifting.","PDD can be treated with an antidepressant medicine. This type of medicine helps relieve depression. Antidepressants don’t cause people to feel “high,” and they are not habit-forming.

It may take weeks or months before you and your doctor know whether an antidepressant is helping you. It is important for you to take the medicine exactly as your doctor tells you. If the antidepressant helps you feel better, you may need to take this medicine for several years. You should continue to take the medicine, even if you begin to feel better. Never stop the medicine without first discussing it with your doctor.

Sometimes there are side effects from stopping antidepressant medicine suddenly. If you want to stop taking your medicine, talk to your doctor first.

Some patients find that counseling can help them deal with specific problems. It’s a safe place where you can talk about your thoughts and feelings. Many doctors believe that combining talk therapy with medicine is the most effective way to treat PDD and other types of depression.","PDD is a chronic condition. It can last for many years. If you have PDD, there are things you can do to help yourself feel better. Talk to your doctor about how you’re feeling. Get treatment for your PDD. It may help to find activities that make you feel good or help you feel a sense of accomplishment.

• Go to a movie.
• Take a drive on a pleasant day.
• Go to a ball game.
• Work in the garden.
• Do something nice for someone else.

People with PDD sometimes experience episodes of major depression. This can make them think about suicide. If you have thoughts about hurting yourself or others, tell someone right away. You can tell your doctor, your family, or a friend. You can also call a suicide hotline. There may be a local number you can call. Or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

Get help right away. PDD and other forms of depression can be treated successfully. There is always someone who can help you.","• I’ve felt down for a long time. Could I have PDD?
• Do I need treatment? What are my treatment options?
• Should I see a counselor or someone else for talk therapy?
• Will I need medicine to treat my symptoms? How long will I need to take it?
• How is the treatment for PDD different than for major depression?
• What should I do if I find myself in a very dark place or start having thoughts of suicide?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Depression

325,Peyronie’s Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/peyronies-disease/,"Peyronie’s disease is the buildup of fibrous scar tissue in the penis, causing it to curve. The curve can be slight to severe. A severe curve can cause erections to be painful or erections that aren’t hard enough for sex. At its worse, Peyronie’s disease can cause impotence.","The primary symptom of Peyronie’s disease is a curved penis. Your penis could be curved up, down, or to either side. While you may not notice it, another symptom is the scar tissue that causes Peyronie’s disease. You can feel this scar tissue just under the skin of your penis. It feels like a ridge or a row of tiny bumps. Another symptom can be erectile dysfunction (difficulty getting or maintaining an erection). You may also notice that the scar tissue is making your penis shorter. Finally, you may have penile pain as a result of Peyronie’s disease. This pain may be in general or it may be only when you have an erection.","Scar tissue under the skin of the penis causes the curve. No one knows for sure why the scar tissue starts. Some men who have Peyronie’s disease have had a penis injury or radiation therapy for prostate cancer that causes scar tissue. Most of the time, though, the cause of the scar tissue isn’t known. The scar tissue can keep getting worse during the first few years, making the penis curve more and more. You might notice this more during an erection. After a few years, the scar tissue usually stops getting worse. Sometimes it even gets better. But in most cases, it doesn’t completely go away.","Your doctor will most likely perform a physical exam. During the exam, they will inspect and feel your penis, looking for scar tissue. This is usually enough for a diagnosis. Sometimes, your doctor will also order an ultrasound to look for scar tissue. If so, you’ll receive an injection that will make you penis erect before the ultrasound.","Since doctors aren’t sure what causes the scar tissue related to Peyronie’s Disease, there is no way to prevent it or avoid it. You may be more at risk for the disease if your father or brother has it. This means that it could run in families. It also becomes more common as you get older. You also have a higher chance of developing this disease if you have a connective tissue disorder.","There is no cure for Peyronie’s disease. Your treatment plan will depend on your symptoms. If your penis curvature isn’t severe or painful and isn’t interfering with sex, you may not need treatment.

Your doctor may prescribe a medicine that can help reduce inflammation and even curvature. Medicines like aminobenzoate potassium or vitamin E help some people. Aminobenzoate potassium is a prescription medicine. Vitamin E is available over the counter. If you take vitamin E, don’t take more than your doctor tells you. Too much vitamin E or aminobenzoate potassium can hurt your liver. Aminobenzoate potassium can also make you nauseous or take away your appetite. Other medicines your doctor may prescribe include tamoxifen, colchicine, and pentoxifylline.

Another treatment option is an intralesional injection. This means the doctor would give you a shot directly into the scar tissue. The shot may contain these drugs: verapamil, interferon, steroids, or collagenase. These may help break down the scar tissue and allow new tissue to grow. These shots are usually given over 3 months.

Discuss treatment options with your doctor. They can recommend the best treatment for your situation. However, not all treatments are guaranteed to work, and some may make the scaring worse.

Surgery might help individuals who have pain during erection or who can’t keep an erection long enough to have sex. There are several surgical procedures that can help. One option is to have a prosthesis (something to make the penis firm) put in the penis. The prosthesis helps make the penis straighter. It also helps erections last longer. Another option is to have the scar tissue removed from the penis. Your doctor can explain all surgical options and can help you decide which is best for you.","Having Peyronie’s disease can impact your sex life and, as a result, your relationship with your partner. It can make you anxious, even irritable. You may not want to talk about it. This can create barriers in your relationship. Instead, try to be open with your partner. It may be helpful to consult with a doctor or therapist who can help initiate open communication between you and your partner.","• What treatment is best for me?
• Is surgery my best option?
• How long is the recovery time after surgery?
• Will I be able to have sex without pain after treatment?
• Are there any support groups in my area?
• Are there any side effects from treatment?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Curvature of the penis National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Penile Curvature (Peyronie’s Disease)

326,Phenylketonuria (PKU),https://familydoctor.org/condition/phenylketonuria-pku/,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic condition where babies are born unable to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. This causes phenylalanine to build up. When phenylalanine levels get too high, it can damage the brain. This can lead to intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Phenylalanine is found in foods that contain protein. PKU is manageable, mostly through your diet. The key to living with PKU successfully is finding it early. That’s why all babies in the United States are screened for the disease at birth.","Newborns don’t initially have symptoms. But within a few months of birth, depending on the severity of the disease, symptoms begin to show. These include:

• Smaller than normal head size (called microcephaly)
• Hyperactivity
• A musty or mouse-like odor in urine, breath, or skin
• Lighter skin, hair, and eyes than their siblings
• Jerking movements of the arms or legs
• Tremors or seizures
• Delayed development
• Behavioral problems
• Psychiatric disorders

If PKU isn’t controlled through changes in diet, it can cause severe and permanent intellectual and developmental disability.","PKU is an inherited disease. This means it’s passed down to the baby through the genes of the mother and father. It’s caused by mutations in the gene that helps make an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme helps break down phenylalanine. When this gene doesn’t work right, the body can’t break down phenylalanine. It starts to build up and causes damage to nerve cells in the brain.

In the United States, you’re at higher risk of having PKU if you’re of European or Native American descent.","All newborn babies born in the United States are routinely tested for a range of diseases and conditions. One of the tests is a blood test that looks for the presence of phenylalanine hydroxylase. If that enzyme is missing, or if there is too much phenylalanine in the blood, more blood and urine tests will be done. These can confirm the diagnosis of PKU.

Nearly all cases of PKU are diagnosed through this newborn blood test.

Rarely, PKU could be missed during the screening process. For this reason, people of any age who have developmental delays or an intellectual disability are often tested for PKU.

PKU can also be diagnosed before the baby is born. A pregnant woman can request genetic testing be done to see if her unborn baby will have the disease. This is done through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. This testing can be useful if the parents already have one child with PKU. Their chances of having another child with the condition are higher than average.","Because PKU is a genetic condition, it can’t be prevented or avoided. Genetic testing is the only way to determine if people carry the defective gene. Some people may carry the gene but not have PKU. These people are called carriers. Both parents must carry one copy of the abnormal gene for the disease to be passed to the baby.","There is no cure for PKU. The most important treatment is a diet that limits foods with phenylalanine. This means the diet must be low in protein.

Newborns diagnosed with the disease must use special infant formula. This can be mixed with small amounts of breast milk or regular formula. It’s a delicate balance. Your baby does need some phenylalanine for normal development. But too much can hurt.

Children and adults who have PKU will also need to follow a low-phenylalanine diet. Phenylalanine is found in most protein foods. This includes all meats and fish, milk, cheese, eggs, nuts, soy, and beans. It’s also found in some non-protein foods. These include certain vegetables and fruit, certain breads, and beer. The sweetener aspartame, which releases phenylalanine when it’s digested, must also be avoided.

If you have PKU, you must follow a strict low-Phenylalanine diet both before becoming pregnant and during the pregnancy. Buildup of phenylalanine will damage your developing fetus, even if the baby hasn’t inherited the defective gene.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the medicine sapropterin dihydrochloride (brand name: Kuvan) for the treatment of PKU. Kuvan can help the body break down phenylalanine. However, the medicine only helps some people. Even for those it does help, it doesn’t decrease enough phenylalanine. Those taking the medicine must still follow a low-phenylalanine diet.","Because the PKU diet is so limiting, it’s hard to get all the essential nutrients the body needs. A special daily formula can help ensure those with PKU get proper nutrition. Taking supplements may also be necessary. For example, fish oil can replace some of the fatty acids (the basic building blocks of lipids, or fats) missing from the standard PKU diet. Those fatty acids can help improve neurological development.

Each person with PKU has a different level of phenylalanine they can tolerate. If you have PKU, you must work closely with your doctor to develop your individual diet. You need to eat enough phenylalanine for healthy growth and development. However, you can’t eat so much that it will be harmful to your health. Going to the doctor often, and getting regular blood tests, helps keep everything in check.

The PKU diet is very restrictive. But it must be followed. Babies who start the diet soon after birth usually develop normally. Many show no symptoms of PKU. Those people who stay on the diet throughout their lives have better overall physical and mental health than those with PKU who don’t. Support from friends and family or a PKU support group can be helpful when facing the challenges that come with this diet.","• Should I get genetic testing for PKU?
• If I have PKU, what should I do during my pregnancy to protect my baby?
• What determines the severity of PKU?
• What should I feed my child?
• What happens if my child eats a food he’s not supposed to eat?
• How long will my child need to follow the restricted PKU diet?
• How often do I need to bring my baby with PKU in for testing?

327,Pica,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pica/,"Pica is a compulsive eating disorder in which people eat nonfood items. Dirt, clay, and flaking paint are the most common items eaten. Less common items include glue, hair, cigarette ashes, and feces. The disorder is more common in children, affecting 10% to 30% of young children ages 1 to 6. It can also occur in children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. On rare occasions, pregnant women crave strange, nonfood items. For these women, pica often involves eating dirt and may be related to an iron and zinc deficiency.","Pica symptoms are related to the nonfood item the person has eaten. They include:

• Stomach upset
• Stomach pain
• Blood in the stool (which may be a sign of an ulcer that developed from eating nonfood items)
• Bowel problems (such as constipation or diarrhea)

These symptoms are the result of the toxic, poisonous, and bacterial content of the nonfood items. Repeatedly eating nonfood items over a period of time can cause:

• Lead poisoning (from eating paint chips that contain lead)
• An intestinal blockage or tear (from eating hard objects, such as rocks)
• Injuries to teeth
• Infections (from organisms and parasites that get inside the body and cause disease)",null,"Many typical children chew on things such as their nails and ice, or they mouth their toys and hair. These are normal habits. However, a person diagnosed with pica repeatedly eats nonfood items, even if those items make them sick. Those people should see a doctor.

• Your doctor will look at your child’s physical symptoms. These could include stomach upset or bowel problems.
• If your child is in a high-risk group for pica (they have intellectual or developmental disabilities), your doctor may ask if you have seen your child eating nonfood items and for how long.
• If the behavior has occurred for a month or more, your doctor may diagnose it as pica.
• Your doctor may order tests, such as blood tests or X-rays to check for possible anemia, look for toxins in the blood, and find blockages in the intestines.
• Your doctor may order a blood test to check your child’s iron and zinc levels. Not having enough of these vitamins is considered a trigger for eating dirt and clay in some cases.","Pica cannot be prevented. Proper nutrition may help some children keep from developing it. If you pay close attention to eating habits and supervise children who tend to put things into their mouths, you may be able to catch the disorder early, before complications can happen. If your child has been diagnosed with pica, you can reduce their risk of eating nonfood items by keeping those items out of reach in your home. Be sure to monitor your child’s outside play, as well.","Treatment for pica will address several areas. Your doctor will address your child’s illness from having eaten nonfood items. For example, your doctor will treat your child’s constipation, diarrhea, ulcer, intestinal tear, infection, or any combination of illnesses. If your doctor finds your child doesn’t have enough iron or zinc, they will address that with a vitamin supplement and dietary recommendations.

Finding the underlying cause of your child’s pica diagnosis is another part of treatment. Your doctor will discuss your child’s home environment, educate you as a parent, and refer your child to a behavioral or mental health specialist.","Most children outgrow pica as they get older. It usually goes away in a few months. However, high-risk populations, such as children and adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities, may need continued monitoring of their behavior and environment.","• What signs should I look for in cases of lead poisoning, ulcers, infections, or intestinal tears?

328,Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS),https://familydoctor.org/condition/pigmented-villonodular-synovitis/,"Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a joint problem that usually affects the hip or knee. It also can occur in the shoulder, ankle, elbow, hand or foot.

When you have PVNS, the lining of a joint becomes swollen and grows. This growth harms the bone around the joint. The lining also makes extra fluid that can cause swelling and make movement very painful.

PVNS isn’t common. It can affect anyone, but it is most common in people 20 to 45 years old. It may happen slightly more often in men.","If you have PVNS, you’ll notice swelling and stiffness in a joint, most often your knee. The joint may hurt. You may have a “popping” feeling when you move the joint. The symptoms usually appear gradually and may come and go over time.",Doctors don’t know exactly what causes PVNS. It doesn’t seem to run in families. It doesn’t seem to be caused by certain jobs or activities.,"PVNS can look like arthritis and some other joint conditions. Your doctor may use tests to check for these conditions. After a physical exam, your doctor may want to take an X-ray of the affected joint.

Your doctor may also want to take some fluid from the joint and test it. He or she may also want to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which takes a picture of the joint.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes PVNS, so it currently cannot be prevented or avoided.","The best way to treat PVNS is to remove the lining of the joint. This can be done with traditional surgery or with arthroscopy. In arthroscopy, the doctor makes a tiny cut in the skin over your joint. Then a thin tube is put into the joint to remove the lining.

You can ease the pressure on the affected joint by resting it. For example, you might use crutches to keep weight off your sore knee or hip. Or you might need to stay off your feet. This may also relieve swelling. You can take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine such as ibuprofen (some brands: Advil, Motrin), aspirin and naproxen (one brand: Aleve) to ease the pain and swelling.","Even with treatment, PVNS comes back about half the time. If the pain comes back again and again, radiation therapy may help. Sometimes, the only real remedy comes by completely replacing the joint.","• What could have caused my symptoms?

329,Pilonidal Cyst,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pilonidal-cyst/,"A pilonidal cyst is a small sac that sticks up from inside the skin. It’s usually located near the tailbone at the top of the buttocks crease. These cysts can contain hair, skin fragments, and other tissue.

Pilonidal cysts are common in young men. They’re also common in people who sit for long periods of time, such as truck drivers. Because they often involve an ingrown hair, the condition also is common in barbers and dog groomers who are often around hair. People with a lot of body hair, who are overweight, and don’t exercise much also are at risk for these cysts.","A pilonidal cyst may appear as a small lump or dimple on the skin. At first, you may have no symptoms. However, sometimes pilonidal cysts can become infected. When this happens, the cyst can become very painful. If it’s infected, you also may notice:

• You have a fever
• The area is swollen and red
• Pus oozing from an opening in the skin
• A foul smell in the area","Pilonidal cysts can happen for many reasons:

• Most pilonidal cysts seem to be caused by ingrown hairs. These are hairs that grow back into the skin instead of growing out. Your body doesn’t know what the ingrown hair is, so it forms a cyst around it.
• Some cysts form around a ruptured hair follicle. This is the structure from which a hair grows.
• Cysts can form if you have trauma to your tailbone.

Some babies are born with a small dimple just above the crease of the buttocks, called a sacral dimple. Sacral dimples can become infected and form a pilonidal abscess.",Your doctor will talk with you about your symptoms. They also will examine your tailbone area,"You can help prevent pilonidal cysts by maintaining a healthy weight. If possible, avoid sitting for long periods of time. Also, keep that area of your body especially clean.","If your cyst has no symptoms and isn’t bothering you, nothing will likely need to be done. However, if your cyst becomes infected, your doctor will likely want to release it. This will help it go away. This procedure can usually be done in your doctor’s office. They will numb the area where the cyst is located. Your doctor will then drain any pus from inside the cyst, and remove any hairs found in the cyst.

Many pilonidal cysts recur (come back). If this happens, you may need surgery to have it removed.","If you have a pilonidal cyst, follow these tips to help keep it from becoming infected:

• Shave around the cyst area to help prevent hairs from getting into the cyst.
• Clean the cyst area with a mild soap and rinse well to remove any soap residue.
• Avoid sitting for long periods of time.","• Do I have a pilonidal cyst?

330,Pinworm Infection,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pinworm-infection/,"Pinworm infection is an intestinal infection caused by small, white worms. Anyone can get it, but it’s most common in young children. It’s easily treated.","If your child is infected with pinworms, they may frequently scratch their bottom. Your child may also move around a lot in bed at night or not be able to sleep. That’s because your child it itchy. The itching is caused by the female pinworm that comes out of the rectum to lay eggs around the anus (the opening to the rectum). The eggs stay in the upper part of the intestine until they hatch. After they hatch, the worms move down the length of the intestine, and then out the anus where they lay more eggs.

You also may be able to see the tiny, white worms (shorter than 1/2 inch in length) on your child’s bottom at night. Or the worms may show up in your child’s stools.","Pinworms are contagious and easily spread, usually from child to child. Pinworm eggs can be picked up on children’s fingers when they’re playing. When children who are infected scratch their itchy bottoms, the tiny eggs can get under their fingernails. Eggs can stay on your child’s skin for several hours. They can survive for up to 3 weeks on clothes, bedding, and toys. If the eggs are on your child’s hands or toys and they put their fingers or toys in their mouth, the tiny eggs can enter their bodies. Children who don’t wash their hands thoroughly before eating and children who suck their thumbs are at an increased risk.

Although pinworm infection is more common in school-aged children, anyone can get it. As children who are infected move around the house, the eggs may be spread, and other family members can become infected. Sometimes adults breathe in the eggs when the bed covers are shaken. However, this isn’t very common.

Pets don’t spread pinworms, although they may carry their own kinds of worms.","Because pinworms usually crawl out of the anus while a child sleeps, the tape test is an easy way to find pinworms. It’s best to do this right when your child wakes up and before they use the bathroom or take a bath. To do the tape test, pat a piece of clear tape on the skin around the anus. Do this for three mornings in a row and save the tape from each morning. Then take the tape to your doctor, who can use a microscope to check for pinworms or eggs. It’s also possible to see the adult worms around the anus during the tape test.","There are ways to prevent or avoid getting pinworm infection—and reinfections. Follow these tips:

• Make sure your child washes their hands before a meal and after using the restroom.
• Keep your child’s fingernails trimmed.
• Discourage your child from nail-biting and scratching their anal area.
• Be sure your child changes into a clean pair of underwear each day.
• Have your child bathe in the morning to reduce egg contamination. If possible, have your child take a shower instead of a bath.
• Change your child’s night clothes, underwear, and bedding after treatment.","Most pinworm infections are mild and easily treated. Your doctor may prescribe a single chewable tablet of a medicine called mebendazole. A second tablet is taken about 3 weeks later if the infection isn’t cured. Or your doctor may recommend another kind of medicine called pyrantel, which is taken as a single dose.

Even if only one child in your family has pinworms, it’s often important that everyone in the household be treated with the pinworm medicine at the same time.","Pinworm infection is very contagious. If you don’t take precautions, it’s easy to become reinfected. If anyone in your home has pinworms, take these steps to get rid of the pinworm eggs. Doing so will minimize your chances of reinfection.

331,Piriformis Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/piriformis-syndrome/,Your piriformis muscle runs from your lower spine to the top of your thigh bone. Piriformis syndrome occurs when this muscle presses on your sciatic nerve (the nerve that goes from your spinal cord to your buttocks and down the back of each leg). This can cause pain and numbness in your lower body.,"The most common symptom of piriformis syndrome is sciatica. This term describes pain, tingling, or numbness that starts in your buttocks and runs down the back of your leg. Sciatica may start as an intense, burning pain deep in the buttocks. The pain gets worse during activities that cause the piriformis muscle to press against the sciatic nerve, such as sitting, climbing stairs, or running.","You can develop piriformis syndrome from everyday activities, such as long periods of inactivity or sitting for long periods of time, climbing stairs, walking, or running. You can also develop it after a traumatic event, such as a car accident or a fall. Abnormal anatomy at birth can also be the cause.","Your doctor will perform a physical exam. They will move the affected leg into several different positions to check your pain level.

If your doctor thinks something other than piriformis syndrome is causing your sciatica, they may order additional tests. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can’t diagnose piriformis syndrome. However, they may show your doctor if something else is pressing on your sciatic nerve.","Once your symptoms improve, you may need to change your activities to avoid developing piriformis syndrome again. The following are some tips to help prevent piriformis syndrome:

• Exercise regularly, but always stretch first.
• Maintain good posture when you’re sitting, driving, or standing.
• Don’t bend over to lift. Lift an object by bending your knees and squatting to pick up the object. Keep your back straight and hold the object close to your body. Avoid twisting your body while lifting.
• Avoid sitting or lying down for long periods of time in a position that puts too much pressure on your buttocks.","Most people who have piriformis syndrome get better with treatment and lifestyle changes. Failure to treat this condition can lead to permanent nerve damage, so be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions.

Self-care tips for piriformis syndrome include the following:

• Temporarily stop doing activities that cause pain, such as running or bicycling.
• Take regular breaks to walk around and stretch if you have to sit for a long period of time.
• Use cold packs and warm packs. Start by using a cold pack on the affected area several times a day for about 15 minutes at a time. After using a cold pack for a couple of days, switch to a warm pack or heating pad. If you continue to have pain, alternate between a cold pack and a warm pack.
• Take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (also called an NSAID), such as ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin), aspirin, or naproxen (one brand name: Aleve) to help relieve your pain. You can also take acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) for pain relief.
• Do exercises to stretch the piriformis muscle. Your doctor can give you information about what stretches will help.
• Massage the affected area. If your pain doesn’t get better with self-treatment, your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist or inject a steroid medicine where the piriformis muscle and the sciatic nerve meet. This may help reduce your pain. If you have severe piriformis syndrome, you may need surgery to relieve the pressure on your sciatic nerve.","You may find that piriformis syndrome comes and goes, depending on your activity level. Try to recognize the activities that seem to trigger it. That way, you can be sure to do exercises to stretch the piriformis muscles before and after those activities.","• What is the likely cause of my pain?
• Do I need any tests to confirm piriformis syndrome?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? What kind of exercise should I do?
• Will alternative therapies such as yoga or massage help relieve my pain? Do I need to take any medicine?

332,Pituitary Tumor | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pituitary-tumors/,"Hypopituitarism is a disorder in which your body doesn’t make enough hormones from the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small, bean-shaped gland at the base of your brain. It plays a role in controlling your body’s endocrine system. The endocrine system is a group of glands that produce and secrete hormones to regulate your body’s processes.

In hypopituitarism, the pituitary gland fails to produce or doesn’t produce enough of one or more of its hormones. When your pituitary gland doesn’t produce enough hormones, your body functions are affected.

The pituitary gland is responsible for releasing:

• Adrenocoricotropichormone (ACTH).This stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and other hormones to help your body deal with stress.
• Anti-diuretic hormone.This controls urine
• Follicle-stimulating hormone.This works with luteinizing hormone to stimulate sperm production from the testes in men. It stimulates egg development and ovulation in women.
• Growth hormone.This controls bone and tissue growth. It also maintains the balance of fat and muscle tissue in the body.
• Luteinizing hormone.This controls testosterone production in men and estrogen in women.
• This causes the uterus to contract during childbirth. It also causes the breast to release milk (in women).
• This controls the development of breasts and the production of breast milk in women.
• Thyroid-stimulating hormone.This stimulates your thyroid gland to make other hormones that regulate your body’s metabolism.

It’s possible for the","symptoms of hypopituitarism to appear suddenly. But it’s much more common for them to develop over time. Because of this, they’re often overlooked for months or years.

• Abdominal discomfort
• Constipation
• Facial puffiness
• Fatigue
• Headaches
• Hoarse voice
• Low blood pressure
• Loss of appetite
• Loss of underarm and pubic hair
• Low interest in sex (men and women)
• Muscle weakness
• Nausea
• Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warm
• Stiffness in the joints
• Thirst and excessive urination
• Unintended weight loss or gain
• Vision problems

• Erectile dysfunction
• Decrease in facial or body hair
• Loss of interest in sexual activity

• Inability to produce milk for breast-feeding
• Infertility
• Irregular or stopped menstrual periods

• Stunted growth, which may result in short stature
• Slowed sexual development

You should see a doctor immediately if certain symptoms of hypopituitarism develop suddenly. These include:

• Severe headache
• Visual problems
• Confusion
• Drop in blood pressure

Sudden onset of these symptoms could be a sign of sudden bleeding into the pituitary. This is called pituitary apoplexy, which is a serious condition.","Hypopituitarism is commonly caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland. A tumor can squeeze the pituitary gland as it grows, which can cause damage. A pituitary tumor can also put pressure on the optic nerves in the eyes and cause visual problems.

Other causes of hypopituitarism are:

• Brain tumor
• Brain surgery
• Head injuries
• Infections of the brain, such as meningitis
• Radiation treatment to the brain
• Stroke
• Tuberculosis
• Uncommon diseases, such as sarcoidosis and histiocytosis X

Hypopituitarism can also be caused by diseases of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a portion of the brain located just above the pituitary gland. It’s responsible for producing hormones that help the pituitary gland function normally.

In other cases, the cause of hypopituitarism may be unknown.","If you have symptoms of hypopituitarism, your doctor may order blood tests to check your hormone levels. Or you doctor may want to check for pituitary tumors or defects. This is done using a computerized tomography (CT) scan or for more detail and smaller concerns, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain. Your doctor may do several vision tests to see if your sight is being affected. In children, X-rays can measure whether bones are growing normally.

Your doctor may also want you to see an endocrinologist. This is a doctor who studies the endocrine system. You may need to go to a special endocrine clinic for other tests.","In most cases, you can’t prevent this disorder. Some medicines can suppress pituitary function. This can cause hypopituitarism. Ask your doctor about these risks if you’re taking glucocorticoids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone).","Your doctor will treat the condition that’s causing your hypopituitarism first. This can help restore your pituitary gland’s ability to produce hormones.

If a tumor on your pituitary gland is causing your hypopituitarism, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove it. Or they may recommend radiation therapy to shrink it.

Sometimes, even after treatment, your body doesn’t produce enough of one or more pituitary hormones. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe a hormone replacement medicine to add to your body’s hormone production.

Hormone replacement medicines include:

• Corticosteroids(such as prednisone and hydrocortisone). This medicine replaces hormones missing because of an adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency.
• Desmopressin (DDAVP).This medicine replaces adrenocoricotropic hormones missing because of an anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. It also helps reduce your body’s loss of water through frequent urination.
• Growth hormone(also called somatropin). This promotes growth in children and benefits adults who have a growth hormone deficiency.
• This replaces thyroid hormones missing because of a thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency.
• Sex hormones.These replace testosterone (in men), estrogen (in women), or an estrogen/progesterone combination (in women) missing because of a pituitary problem.

If you’re taking hormone replacement medicine, your doctor may want to regularly monitor your hormone level. Doing so will make sure you’re getting the right amount of replacement hormones.

If you become very sick (such as with the flu) or go through a stressful time, your doctor may adjust the dose of replacement hormone you take (just as a normally functioning pituitary gland would do). You might also need a dose adjustment if you become pregnant or have a significant change in weight.

You should carry a medical alert card and bracelet at all times. This way, emergency medical workers know what kind of care you need in case of emergency.",Managing hypopituitarism using hormone replacement therapy is often successful. Just remember that you’ll need to check in regularly with your doctor to monitor hormone levels.,"• What is the likely cause of my hypopituitarism?

334,Plagiocephaly,https://familydoctor.org/condition/plagiocephaly/,"Plagiocephaly is a condition where your baby’s head has a flat spot or is misshapen. There are various levels of severity and can occur during pregnancy or after birth.

There are two main types of plagiocephaly. Positional plagiocephaly, or “flat head syndrome,” is more common. It occurs in about 50% of children. Congenital plagiocephaly, or craniosynostosis, is a rare birth defect.","Doctors diagnose plagiocephaly in babies. Signs of the condition vary based on type and level of severity. Your doctor can help identify your baby’s symptoms, which include:

• Flattened area on back, side, or front of head
• Lack of hair in one spot
• Appearance of misshaped or slanted head
• Uneven ears (one ear pushed forward or up on the head)

• Lack of soft spot on your baby’s head
• Ridges or hard edges along skull
• Uneven facial features or other facial defects
• Lack of growth of your infant’s head size
• Seizures","Positional plagiocephaly can occur one of two ways. It has become more widespread since the mid-1990s when the National Institutes of Health launched the Back to Sleep campaign. Now known as Safe to Sleep®, the campaign’s goal is to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The main guideline is for babies to be on their back when sleeping. Sleeping or lying in the same position can produce a flat spot. Premature babies, who have softer skulls, or infants who are hospitalized for a prolonged time are more vulnerable. While placing your baby on their back may lead to plagiocephaly, it is still the safest position to place them in for sleep.

Babies also can be born with a flattened head due to pressure in the womb. This is more common in multiple births.

Congenital plagiocephaly, or craniosynostosis, is a birth defect. When your baby is born, the seams (sutures) on their head should be open and soft. This allows their skull to continue growing and reshaping in their first few years. With craniosynostosis, one or more of the seams close early, affecting the shape of your baby’s head.","A newborn baby’s skull is naturally soft and will continue to grow and reshape over time. As parents, you will be able to identify if your baby’s head is not growing or appears misshaped by regularly monitoring it. Your doctor also will measure your child’s head at their routine checkups.

Doctors recommend observing your baby’s head by looking directly down on it from above. If you detect a persistent flat area on your baby’s head, you can monitor the spot by taking photos. Contact your doctor if the spot shows no change or worsens.

Tests are not required to diagnose flat head syndrome. If your doctor suspects possible congenital plagiocephaly, they may order additional tests, such as an X-ray.","There are things you can do to help prevent your baby from developing a flat head. Alternate your baby’s head position during sleep and have supervised tummy time when your baby is awake. You also can use a special mattress or pillow that puts less pressure on your baby’s head.

The cause of craniosynostosis is mostly unknown, and therefore is difficult to prevent. Recent studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report potential factors that can lead to craniosynostosis. These include thyroid disease, use of clomiphene citrate (a fertility medication), or certain genetic syndromes.","Based on the type and level of your baby’s condition, doctors may recommend one or more treatment options. You should begin treatment at a young age, between 3 and 18 months, while the skull is still forming.

Repositioning is a practice that teaches you how to regularly alternate your baby’s head position. This can prevent or help correct flat head syndrome. Suggestions for this method include:

• Plan plenty of tummy time, which also helps strengthen their neck.
• Reduce the amount of time your baby lies in a car seat, baby carrier, baby swing, etc.
• Rotate sides during feeding time, which also can help prevent torticollis (twisted neck muscles.)
• Put your baby in different positions in their crib. Your baby should lie on their back to reduce SIDS. However, you should rotate which direction your baby faces in their crib, such as away from or toward the door. You also can place a mobile above their crib to encourage head movement in different directions.

Another option is “helmet therapy.” Your baby will wear a medical helmet for several months to reshape their skull. The success rate for this form of treatment is high.

Babies who have congenital plagiocephaly, or craniosynostosis, often require surgery. This allows the plates on their head to grow and reshape, and also eases pressure on their brain. Typically, this type of surgery occurs prior to age 1. Use of a medical helmet may also be necessary. Additional medical treatments may be required if craniosynostosis is part of a genetic syndrome with other conditions.","Babies who have flat head syndrome have a high chance of living a normal life. They can grow out of it naturally or correct it with therapy. It is unlikely to cause issues with their brain growth or function.

However, if plagiocephaly is left untreated, children are at risk of developmental, neurological, or psychological difficulties.

Children who grow up with severe plagiocephaly, like craniosynostosis, will likely require healthcare observation to manage ongoing or new problems. They also may benefit from counseling if they experience self-esteem issues.","• How does a medical helmet work, and is it painful?
• Does insurance cover the cost of a medical helmet?
• Can flat head syndrome return again after treatment?
• How will I know if my baby’s flat head needs treatment?
• If one baby has plagiocephaly, are my other children likely to have it?","The National Association for Plagiocephaly

335,Plantar Fasciitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/plantar-fasciitis/,"Plantar fasciitis is an inflammatory condition. It occurs in the plantar fascia, which is a band of tissue that runs along the bottom of your foot. The plantar fascia works like a rubber band. It forms the arch of your foot and connects your heel to your toes. If the band is short, you have a high arch. If the band is long, you have a low, or flat, arch. A pad of fat covers the tissue and helps your heels to absorb shock put on your feet. Damage to the plantar fascia can cause heel swelling and pain.","Pain and swelling are the main symptoms of plantar fasciitis. Pain may be worse in the morning or when you put pressure on your heel. It may be dull or sharp, depending on the time of day and what you’re doing.","As you age, the plantar fascia becomes less like a rubber band and more like a rope that doesn’t stretch as well. The fat pad on your heel becomes thinner and can’t absorb as much shock. The extra shock can damage the plantar fascia and may cause it to swell, bruise, or tear. Most people also have pain to some degree.

Repeated impact on the heel, like from running, walking, or standing, also can cause plantar fasciitis. Existing foot arch problems – such as flat feet and high arches – can also cause plantar fasciitis.","Your doctor will examine your foot and review your symptoms. They will want to know about your pain, when it occurs, and how long you’ve had it. Your doctor may order tests to make sure the pain is not caused by another problem. These tests could include an X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","You cannot prevent plantar fasciitis if aging is the cause. However, there are risk factors that can increase your chance of getting it. You may be able to avoid one or more of these. Risks include:

• Being overweight or having obesity
• Having diabetes
• Spending most of the day on your feet
• Doing repeated movements that put more impact on your feet and heels
• Becoming very active in a short period of time
• Having very high arches
• Having tight calf muscles","In most cases, your doctor will start with basic treatments that can be done at home. These may vary depending on the cause of your pain.

• If you walk or run a lot, you may need to cut back. Ask your doctor how much exercise you should do.
• If you have high arches, talk to your doctor about using shoe inserts called orthotics. These help to support your arches. You will need to be fitted for them.
• If you are overweight or have obesity, losing weight can help reduce pressure on your heels.
• If your job involves standing for long periods of time, place some type of padding on the floor where you stand. You also may try orthotics to provide extra cushion to your heels.
• You also should treat with ice to decrease inflammation. Put your foot on ice for about 10 minutes 2-3 times per day.

Stretching exercises for your feet and legs are important. Do the stretches shown here at least twice a day. Do not bounce when you stretch.

• Plantar fascia stretch: Stand straight with your hands forward against a wall. Place your injured leg slightly behind your other leg. With your heels flat on the floor and your feet pointed straight ahead, slowly bend both knees. You should feel the stretch in the lower part of your leg. Hold the stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. Repeat the stretch 6 to 8 times.
• Calf stretch: Stand straight with your hands forward against a wall. Place your injured leg behind your other leg. With your injured leg straight, your heel flat on the floor, and your feet pointed straight ahead, lean forward slowly and bend the front leg. You should feel the stretch in the middle of your calf. Hold the stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. Repeat the stretch 6 to 8 times.

Strengthening exercises are important as well. You can strengthen your leg muscles by standing on the ball of your foot at the edge of a step and rising up onto your toes as high as possible. Relax between toe raises and let your heel fall a little lower than the edge of the step. You can strengthen your foot muscles by grabbing a towel with your toes as if you are going to pick it up with your foot. Repeat these exercises several times a day.

Medicines, such as naproxen and ibuprofen, can help reduce swelling and pain. Talk to your family doctor before you start a new medicine.","Most cases of plantar fasciitis go away over time. For best results, try to be consistent in your treatment approaches. If these do not work, your doctor may suggest other options, such as:

• Professional physical therapy
• Splints on your foot at night
• Tape on your foot
• Corticosteroid injections into the plantar fascia

In rare cases, you may need surgery. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of these treatments.","• What is the cause of my heel pain?
• What is the best treatment option for me?
• What kind of stretching and strengthening exercises should I do?
• How long before I can expect relief from my symptoms?
• Is it possible that my symptoms could return after treatment?

336,Pleurisy | Symptoms and treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pleurisy-pleuritis/,"Pleurisy is a medical condition that affects the lining of your lungs and chest. The lining can become inflamed or irritated. This happens when excessive fluid collects in the “pleural space.” Typically, there is a small amount of fluid in the space, which is normal.","The main symptom of pleurisy is chest pain. It can be sharp and sudden. It is painful to cough or take a deep breath. Ongoing chest pain is common. Shortness of breath is common, too. You might develop a fever or other aches. More symptoms depend on the cause of pleurisy.

Discomfort is the main factor in living with pleurisy. You will have ongoing pain until the infection goes away or another cause is treated. Try to slow down and take it easy while you have pleurisy. Don’t do any activity that will cause rapid breathing or excessive coughing.

Find out what else could be causing your symptoms.","Pleurisy is often caused by an infection. The infection could be viral (flu). It could be bacterial (pneumonia or tuberculosis). Other causes include:

• Asbestos-related disease (from home or work exposure)
• Certain cancers (lung, lymphoma, and mesothelioma)
• Chest trauma
• A blood clot that travels to the lung
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Lupus (an autoimmune disorder)","Contact your doctor if you have pleurisy symptoms. Your doctor will do a physical exam. He or she will ask you questions about your medical history. Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. He or she can hear the lining rubbing together. Based on these results, your doctor can order several tests. These include:

• Blood test. An infection may show up in your blood. The test also can detect autoimmune disorders. This includes rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Pleurisy could be a symptom of both conditions.
• X-ray. Your doctor can use an X-ray to get a picture of your chest. This will show if there is something in the space between the lining. There may be air or gas in the area. That condition is called a pneumothorax. Lung disease or a lung injury can cause this condition.
• Your doctor may use sound waves to get a picture of your chest. The view may detect a pleural effusion. You can get this when fluid builds up in the pleural space.
• Computerized tomography (CT). This checks for other causes of pleurisy. A chest CT may find a blood clot in the lung. This condition is called a pulmonary embolism. It also could find hemothorax. This occurs when blood gets in the pleural space. It can be caused by a chest injury, chest surgery, or lung cancer.
• Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This test will help your doctor rule out heart problems or defects.
• Fluid removal. This is a procedure that might be performed in your doctor’s office, the emergency room, or a surgical center. Your doctor will apply a numbing medicine to the skin around your chest muscles. He or she will insert a small needle into that area to collect fluid. That sample will be sent to a lab.",Treating a bacterial infection (early) may prevent pleurisy. It is more difficult to treat a viral infection. Finding and treating other causes of pleurisy may help.,"Your doctor bases pleurisy treatment on the underlying cause. If you have a bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic. For a viral infection, they may recommend an antiviral medicine, although most viral infections need to run their course without specific treatment. When another condition causes your pleurisy, your doctor will focus on treating that issue.

To ease your symptoms, you can take over-the-counter medicine. Acetaminophen (one brand: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (brands: Advil, Motrin) can help reduce pain and inflammation. Cough syrup may also help control excessive coughing. However, don’t completely suppress your cough—doing so may increase your risk of pneumonia. Resting, especially by lying on the painful side, can provide some relief. In rare cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove a fluid buildup around your lungs.",null,"• How can I tell if it is pleurisy or a common cold?

• chills
• chest pain

You may also sweat, have a headache, and feel very tired. Some people also experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

If any of these symptoms are severe, call your family doctor. You should also call your doctor if you suddenly start getting worse after having a cold or the flu.","Most cases of pneumonia are caused by:

• Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. They can cause pneumonia on their own, or after you’ve had a cold or the flu. Bacterial pneumonia usually only affects one area of a lung.
• Any virus that affects the respiratory tract can cause pneumonia. This includes the flu virus and the virus that causes the common cold. In children under 1 year old, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause. Viral pneumonia tends to be mild. It often gets better on its own in 1 to 3 weeks.
• Some fungal infections can lead to pneumonia, especially in people with weakened immune systems. There are also some fungi that occur in the soil in certain parts of the United States that can lead to pneumonia.

You can also get pneumonia through aspiration. This is when you inhale particles into your lungs. These could be food, saliva, liquids, or vomit. It occurs most often after vomiting, and you are not strong enough to cough the particles out. The particles cause irritation, swelling and can get infected. This causes pneumonia.","Pneumonia can sometimes be hard to diagnose because the symptoms are the same as for a bad cold or flu. If you think it could be pneumonia, you should see your doctor. Your doctor may diagnose your illness based on your medical history and the results from a physical exam. He or she will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. Your doctor may also do some tests, such as a chest X-ray or a blood test. A chest X-ray can show your doctor if you have pneumonia and how widespread the infection is. Blood and mucus tests can help your doctor tell whether bacteria, a virus, or a fungal organism is causing your illness.","There are many factors that can raise your risk for developing pneumonia. These include:

• Your age. People older than 65 are at increased risk because the immune system becomes less able to fight off infection as you age. Infants age 2 or younger are also at increased risk because their immune systems haven’t fully developed yet.
• Your environment. Regularly breathing in dust, chemicals, air pollution, or toxic fumes can damage your lungs. This makes your lungs more vulnerable to infection.
• Your lifestyle. Habits such as smoking cigarettes or abusing alcohol can increase your risk. Smoking damages the lungs, while alcohol interferes with how your body fights infection.
• Your immune system. If your immune system is weakened, it’s easier for you to get pneumonia because your body can’t fight off the infection. This could include people who have HIV/AIDS, have had an organ transplant, are receiving chemotherapy, or have long-term steroid use.
• If you are hospitalized, especially in an ICU. Being in the ICU (intensive care unit) raises your risk of pneumonia. Your risk increases if you are using a ventilator to help you breathe. Ventilators make it hard for you to cough and can trap germs that cause infection in your lungs.
• If you have recently had major surgery or a serious injury. Recovering from major surgery or injury can make it difficult for you to cough. This is the body’s quickest defense for getting particles out of the lungs. Recovery also typically requires a lot of bed rest. Lying down on your back for an extended period of time can allow fluid or mucus to gather in your lungs. This gives bacteria a place to grow.

• Get the flu vaccine each year. People can develop bacterial pneumonia after a case of the flu. You can reduce this risk by getting the yearly flu shot.
• Get the pneumococcal vaccine. This helps prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria.
• Practice good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
• Don’t smoke. Smoking damages your lungs and makes it harder for your body to defend itself from germs and disease. If you smoke, talk to your family doctor about quitting as soon as possible.
• Practice a healthy lifestyle. Eat a balanced diet full of fruits and vegetables. Exercise regularly. Get plenty of sleep. These things help your immune system stay strong.
• Avoid sick people. Being around people who are sick increases your risk of catching what they have.","Treatment depends on several factors. These include what caused your pneumonia, how severe your symptoms are, how healthy you are overall, and your age.

For bacterial pneumonia, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics. Most of your symptoms should improve within a few days. A cough can last for several weeks. Be sure to follow your doctor’s directions carefully. Take all the antibiotic medicine that your doctor prescribes. If you don’t, some bacteria may stay in your body. This can cause your pneumonia to come back. It can also increase your risk of antibiotic resistance.

Antibiotics don’t work to treat viral infections. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor will likely talk to you about ways to treat your symptoms. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are available to lower fever, relieve pain, and ease your cough. However, some coughing is okay because it can help clear your lungs. Be sure to talk to your doctor before you take a cough suppressant.

If a fungus is causing your pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antifungal medicine.

In severe cases of pneumonia, you may need to be hospitalized. If you are experiencing shortness of breath, you may be given oxygen to help your breathing. You might also receive antibiotics intravenously (through an IV). People who have weakened immune systems, heart disease or lung conditions, and people who were already very sick before developing pneumonia are most likely to be hospitalized. Babies, young children, and adults who are 65 years of age and older are also at increased risk.","Your doctor may schedule a follow-up appointment after he or she diagnoses you with pneumonia. At this visit, he or she might take another chest X-ray to make sure the pneumonia infection is clearing up. Keep in mind that chest X-rays can take months to return to normal. However, if your symptoms are not improving, your doctor may decide to try another form of treatment.

Although you may be feeling better, it’s important to keep your follow-up appointment. The infection can still be in your lungs even if you’re no longer experiencing symptoms.","• I have a chronic condition. Am I at higher risk for pneumonia?

• chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
• asthma
• heart disease
• emphysema
• diabetes
• sickle cell disease

There isn’t a vaccine for all types of pneumonia, but 2 vaccines are available. These help prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria. The first is recommended for all children younger than 5 years of age. The second is recommended for anyone age 2 or older who is at increased risk for pneumonia. Getting the pneumonia vaccine is especially important if you:

• Are 65 years of age or older.
• Have certain chronic conditions, such as asthma, lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, sickle cell disease, or cirrhosis.
• Smoke.
• Have a weakened immune system because of HIV/AIDS, kidney failure, a damaged or removed spleen, a recent organ transplant, or receiving chemotherapy.
• Have cochlear implants (an electronic device that helps you hear).

The pneumococcal vaccines can’t prevent all cases of pneumonia. But they can make it less likely that people who are at risk will experience the severe, and possibly life-threatening, complications of pneumonia.

In addition to taking any antibiotics and/or medicine your doctor prescribes, you should also:

• Get lots of rest. Rest will help your body fight the infection.
• Drink plenty of fluids. Fluids will keep you hydrated. They can help loosen the mucus in your lungs. Try water, warm tea, and clear soups.
• Stop smoking if you smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Smoke can make your symptoms worse. Smoking also increases your risk of developing pneumonia and other lung problems in the future. You should also avoid lit fireplaces or other areas where the air may not be clean.
• Stay home from school or work until your symptoms go away. This usually means waiting until your fever breaks and you aren’t coughing up mucus. Ask your doctor when it’s okay for you to return to school or work.
• Use a cool-mist humidifier or take a warm bath. This will help clear your lungs and make it easier for you to breathe.

Pneumonia can be life-threatening if left untreated, especially for certain at-risk people. You should call your doctor if you have a cough that won’t go away, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever. You should also call your doctor if you suddenly begin to feel worse after having a cold or the flu."
338,Poison Ivy Rash (Treatment and Prevention),https://familydoctor.org/condition/poison-ivy/,"Poison ivy can cause a painful and itchy rash. Keep reading to learn the best poison ivy rash treatment and prevention strategies to help you recover quickly and avoid future outbreaks.

Poison ivy is a type of toxic plant. It is very common in most parts of the United States. Poison ivy often grows low to the ground, resembling a weed or shrub. It also can grow taller as a vine, along plants, trees, or poles. Both forms have stems with 3 leaves. The leaves change color with the seasons. They may produce whitish flowers or berries.",The main symptom of poison ivy is a rash. This is otherwise known as contact dermatitis. The rash can be mild or severe. It may appear right away or 1 to 2 days after contact. It is marked by redness and swelling. Small blisters may form and become itchy or painful. Try not to scratch the blisters. Bacteria from under your fingernails can get into the blisters and cause an infection.,"Poison ivy contains an oil called urushiol. Most people are allergic to it. This oil sticks to your skin when you come into contact with it. You can get the oil on your skin by:

• Touching the poison ivy plant
• Touching clothing or shoes that have the oil on them
• Touching lawn or garden tools that have the oil on them
• Touching pets that have been around poison ivy and have the oil on their fur
• Burning the poison ivy plant (the oil from the plant is carried in the smoke)",A doctor can diagnose a poison ivy rash by reviewing your symptoms. They will also examine your rash to make sure it’s not caused by an allergy or other medical condition.,"The first step in poison ivy rash prevention is identifying the plant and avoiding it whenever possible. Look out for the plant any time you are outside. A well-known saying to remember is, “Leaves of three, let them be.” Other tips to prevent poison ivy include:

• Wear protective clothing when you work in the lawn or garden. This includes long sleeves and pants, as well as gloves.
• Wash your clothes and shoes after being outside.
• Clean your gloves and tools after each use.
• Wash your pets if you think they have come into contact with the plant. Most pets are not allergic to the oil, but they can spread it to you.

These tips are especially important if you know you have a severe allergy to poison ivy.

The poison ivy rash is not contagious. But you can spread poison ivy to another person if they touch the oil on you or your clothing.","Wash your skin right away if you come into contact with poison ivy or another toxic plant. Its oil can bond to your skin within minutes. Use soap and cool water. This can help remove the oil or prevent the oil from spreading. Products that contain certain cleansers, such as mineral oil, may help.

Some over-the-counter medicines help relieve rash symptoms, such as pain and itching. These include:

• Hydrocortisone creams (one brand name: Cortizone-10)
• Calamine lotion
• Antihistamine tablets (one brand name: Benadryl)

Oatmeal baths and wet compresses can help reduce symptoms as well.",null,"• How long does poison ivy rash last?

339,Poisoning,https://familydoctor.org/condition/poisoning/,"Poison is any substance that is harmful to your body. Many different types of poison exist. Poisonous substances can be products you have in your house. Medicines that aren’t taken as directed can be harmful. There are several ways you can be exposed to poison. You could breathe it in, swallow it, or absorb it through your skin. Poisoning can be an accident or a planned action.","The effects of poisoning depend on the substance, amount, and type of contact. Your age, weight, and state of health also affect your symptoms.

Possible symptoms of poisoning include:

• Nausea and/or vomiting
• Diarrhea
• Redness or sores around the mouth
• Dry mouth
• Drooling or foaming at the mouth
• Trouble breathing
• Dilated pupils (bigger than normal) or constricted pupils (smaller than normal)
• Confusion
• Fainting
• Shaking or seizures","There are a number of substances that are harmful and can cause poisoning. These include:

• Household products and personal care products, like nail polish remover and mouthwash, which is harmful to children
• Cleaning products and detergents
• Paint thinner
• Pesticides and bug spray
• Lawn chemicals, such as herbicides, fertilizers, and fungicides
• Metals, such as lead
• Mercury, which can be found in old thermometers and batteries
• Prescription and over-the-counter medicines when combined or taken the wrong way
• Illegal drugs
• Carbon monoxide gas
• Spoiled food
• Plants, such as poison ivy and poison oak
• Venom from certain snakes and insects","Your doctor can diagnose poisoning. First, they will review your medical history and do a physical exam. Your doctor also can perform tests to find the cause. Most poisons can be detected in your blood or urine. Your doctor may order a toxicology screen. This checks for common drugs using a urine or saliva sample.","The best way to prevent poisoning is to avoid contact with harmful substances. Below are some guidelines you should follow.

• Keep all household substances out of the reach of children. You should put them in high or locked cabinets. This includes medicine, cleaning products, and other harmful chemicals. You also can childproof your house with safety locks and guards.
• Wear protective clothing, like gloves, when you use cleaners and chemicals.
• Avoid using pesticides, paint thinner, and similar chemicals inside the house or garage. Try to find non-chemical solutions. If you do use these chemicals inside, keep the area well aired.
• Don’t mix chemicals. They may become poisonous when mixed. Bleach and ammonia are one example. When you mix them together, they create a deadly gas.
• Keep medicines and chemicals in their original containers.
• Label everything inside your medicine cabinet.
• Get rid of old or expired medicines and household products. Dispose of them safely, per FDA and hazardous waste guidelines. Call poison control for more information.
• Follow all product label directions.
• Have all gas-fueled, oil-fueled, and wood-fueled appliances serviced regularly. Be sure they are well vented.
• Never run your car in the garage, other than when you are coming or leaving.
• Install a carbon monoxide detector in your home. Regularly test and replace the batteries.","Treatment depends on the person and the type of poisoning. In this situation, try your best to stay calm. The first step is to get away from or remove the poison if you can. If the poison is in the air, move to a safe place with fresh air. If the poison is on the skin, rinse it off with water and remove nearby clothing. If the person swallowed the poison, do not try to induce vomiting. This approach is no longer recommended.

If the poisoned person is awake and alert, call the poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. You should have this number stored in your house and phone. Stay on the phone with the operator and follow all instructions. Try to have the following information ready:

• The person’s age and weight
• The person’s address
• The type of poisonous substance they were exposed to
• The time of the incident
• A list of allergies the person has

Call 911 if the poisoned person is unconscious or not breathing. The medical team will provide additional treatment. They can use methods to get rid of the poison before it causes more harm. Some types of poison have antidotes. These work by reversing the poison’s effects and curing it. Treatment also includes measures to relieve symptoms.","The sooner you recognize poisoning symptoms, the better the outcome. However, the lasting effects of poisoning vary. It depends on the substance, amount, and type of exposure. Your age, weight, and state of health also affect your outcome. Poisoning can cause short-term effects, like a skin rash or brief illness. In serious cases, it can cause brain damage, a coma, or death.","• Is there any instance where I should induce vomiting if I believe poison has been swallowed?

340,Polycystic Kidney Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease/,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited disease that affects the kidneys. Inherited means it runs in families and is passed down from parents. It causes abnormal sacs of fluid (called cysts) to grow in the kidneys. If too many cysts grow or if they get too big, the kidneys become damaged. The cysts may also cause pain or get infected.

PKD is the most common inherited disease in the United States. Children of parents who have PKD have a 50% chance of getting the disease.","The most common symptom is high blood pressure. About 60% of people who have PKD also have high blood pressure, which can be treated with medicine. Other symptoms include:

• Pain in the back and side
• Blood in the urine
• Frequent kidney infections

Not all patients will have all of these symptoms. For many people, PKD is mild and causes only minor problems. For others, PKD is more severe and can cause kidney failure. About 50% of patients who have PKD have kidney failure by age 60. Dialysis (blood filtering) and kidney transplants are both effective treatments for kidney failure.

People who have PKD may also have cysts in the liver, but these cysts seldom cause problems. Other organs that may be affected include the heart, brain, intestines, pancreas, ovaries, and spleen. PKD can cause problems with heart valves in some people. When PKD affects the brain, it can cause an aneurysm (a bulging blood vessel that can rupture).","Genes tell your body how to work. When you have PKD, there’s something faulty with your genes, and they don’t tell your body how to work correctly. That leads to the problems with PKD. Genes are passed from a parent to a child. The bad genes that cause PKD can be passed from a parent to a child. That’s how PKD runs in families.

PKD is generally worse in men, African Americans, and people who have sickle cell disease. There is also a childhood form of PKD, which is usually more severe than the type that occurs in adults.","PKD is often diagnosed when a person begins to have symptoms or is at risk for the disease.

Your doctor may want you to have an ultrasound imaging test or a CT (computerized tomography) scan. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your organs. A CT scan uses many X-rays to form pictures of your organs. Both tests are painless and can detect cysts on the kidneys.

PKD also can be diagnosed in unborn babies using a test called amniocentesis. During this test, doctors take a very small amount of the amniotic fluid from the womb. They test the fluid for PKD. Another test, called chorionic villus sampling, involves testing a very small piece of the placenta. If you have PKD and you’re pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant, talk with your doctor about these procedures.","There is no way to prevent polycystic kidney disease. There is also no cure. However, you can manage symptoms of PKD through lifestyle changes and medication. Talk to your doctor about how to best manage your symptoms.","No treatment is available for the cysts caused by PKD. If the cysts are causing symptoms, the symptoms can be treated to make you more comfortable.","If you have PKD, it’s important to get regular checkups and talk with your doctor. Managing PKD is easier when you eat a well-balanced diet, so talk with your doctor about what foods you should and shouldn’t eat. You should also stay physically active.

It’s especially important to monitor and control your blood pressure when you have PKD. This can help slow the growth of cysts. It also helps prolong kidney function.

If you have PKD and you also have a relative who has had a brain aneurysm, your doctor may suggest that you have a CT or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of your brain to check for an aneurysm. (MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce a picture of your brain.) If you’re at high risk of an aneurysm, your doctor may suggest you have CT or MRI of the brain every few years to detect an aneurysm before it causes problems.","• What treatment is best for my symptoms?

341,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that occurs when cysts form on a woman’s ovaries. An imbalance of hormone levels in a woman’s body causes the cysts to form. The cysts are like tiny, fluid-filled balloons.

Women can develop PCOS during their teenage or childbearing years. PCOS can cause changes in a woman’s:

• Menstrual cycles
• Fertility
• Hormone levels
• Heart and blood vessels
• Appearance","Usually, women who have PCOS have irregular, infrequent, or no menstrual periods. They may also have trouble getting pregnant. Some women who have PCOS do not experience any symptoms.

Other signs and symptoms of PCOS may include:

• Overweight and obesity
• Excessive hair growth on the face, nipple area, chest, lower abdomen, and thighs
• Thinning hair or bald spots
• Dark patches of skin
• Anxiety or depression
• Pelvic pain

Women who have PCOS are also more likely to have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and high levels of triglycerides. Together with obesity, these conditions are known as the “metabolic syndrome.”","Doctors do not know exactly what causes PCOS. If you have PCOS, you have a hormone imbalance. Your ovaries make too much of one type of hormone (called androgens). You may also have too much insulin, which regulates your blood sugar levels. You also may have insulin resistance. These hormone problems cause the symptoms of PCOS.

PCOS seems to be heredity, meaning that it runs in families. You are more likely to have PCOS if your mother or sister has PCOS.","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and will look for the signs of PCOS. They will give you a full physical examination, which will most likely include a pelvic exam. Blood tests can measure your hormone levels. An ultrasound exam can show if you have cysts on your ovaries.","There is no way to prevent polycystic ovary syndrome. There is also no cure. However, you can manage symptoms of PCOS through lifestyle changes and medication. Talk to your doctor about how to best manage your symptoms.","Treatment for PCOS focuses on managing the symptoms. You might need to lose weight. Eating healthy and getting plenty of exercise can help manage PCOS.

Medicine can help regulate your menstrual cycle and reduce abnormal hair growth and acne. Birth control pills (for women not trying to have a baby) and metformin are 2 prescription medicines that are often helpful. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, those conditions also need treatment. If you want to have a baby, there are medicines that may help you get pregnant.","If you have PCOS, you are more likely to develop high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes. This means you have a greater risk for strokes and heart attacks. It is important to work with your doctor on a health plan to minimize these risks.

Problems with menstrual periods may also cause women who have PCOS to be infertile (unable to get pregnant). PCOS also causes you to have a higher risk for cancer of the uterus or breast. You should see your doctor regularly for health screenings.

Women who have PCOS are also more likely to have anxiety or depression. If you are feeling anxious or depressed, talk to your doctor. Treatment is available.","• What is the likely cause of my polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?

342,Polycythemia Vera,https://familydoctor.org/condition/polycythemia-vera/,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a rare disease that causes your body to make too many red blood cells. Your blood may become too thick. This causes serious health problems. PV increases the risk of abnormal blood clots, which could lead to a heart attack or stroke. This disease occurs most often in people who are 60 years old or older.","In its early stages, PV usually doesn’t cause any symptoms. As the disease progresses, symptoms include:

• Shortness of breath
• Dizziness
• Itchy or flushed skin
• Fatigue
• Headaches
• A tingling or burning sensation in the hands and feet","PV begins in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones that makes blood cells. When bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, the result is PV.","If you have symptoms of PV, your doctor may examine you and order blood tests. Sometimes the disease may be found by accident when you have blood work done for another reason. Your doctor will want you to see a hematologist (a doctor who treats blood disorders) to make the diagnosis. If they suspect you may have PV, you may need to have a bone marrow biopsy. This is when a small part of your bone marrow is removed and examined for signs of PV.",PV can’t be prevented or avoided.,"There is no single treatment for PV. Doctors adjust the treatment for each patient. Treatment may include a phlebotomy. In this treatment, some of your blood is removed to help keep the number of red blood cells down and lower the risk of blood clots. Treatment may also include a medicine that keeps the bone marrow from making too many red blood cells or to help reduce the risk of blood clots. Doctors can also treat the itchy skin and burning pain that you may experience.","PV is a serious illness that can cause death, especially if it’s not treated. There is currently no cure for PV. However, there are some lifestyle adjustments that may make your symptoms feel better.

• If your doctor says you can, try to get moderate exercise several times a week. This can keep your blood flowing freely and decrease the risk of blood clots.
• Avoid tobacco products. These can make the inside of your blood vessels become narrow. That can cause blood clots to form and lead to a heart attack or stroke.
• Keep it cool when bathing. Your skin may feel worse after a hot bath or shower, so opt for a cool one. Use a gentle soap and pat your skin dry afterward.
• Drink plenty of water.

With treatments, people who have the disease can live longer lives, many for a normal lifespan. Treatments and regular monitoring from your doctor are an important part of living with PV.","• I’ve been diagnosed with polycythemia vera. Am I at risk of a stroke?

343,Polyps,https://familydoctor.org/condition/polyps/,"Polyps are abnormal growths of tissue. They are small and can be shaped like a raised bump or a stalk with a stem. Polyps latch onto the walls, or lining, of your organs. The colon is the most common place to get a polyp. You can get polyps in other places, too, though, including the:

• Throat
• Stomach
• Cervix (women)
• Uterus (women)

Most polyps are not dangerous, but some can become cancerous tumors.",Most people who have polyps do not have symptoms. Contact your doctor if you have bleeding from your rectum. This can be a sign of colon polyps. Women may have yellow discharge or irregular bleeding from their vaginas. These can be signs of cervical or uterine polyps or cancer.,"There is no one specific reason you get a polyp. Abnormal growths of body cells and tissue cause them to form.

People with rare, inherited disorders have a greater chance of getting colon polyps. These include:

• Juvenile polyposis
• Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
• Gardner syndrome
• Lynch syndrome
• Peutz-Jeghers syndrome","If a polyp is in your ear or nose, you may see or feel it. Colon polyps often are diagnosed during a colorectal screening, called a colonoscopy. Cervical and uterine polyps may be diagnosed during a pap smear or colposcopy. If your doctor finds a polyp anywhere, he or she will likely do a biopsy. This consists of removing a sample of abnormal tissue. They will send it to a lab to check the cells and look for cancer.","Polyps cannot be prevented. As you age, your risk of getting a colon polyp increases. You can help find colon polyps early by getting routine colorectal screenings. Finding the polyps early can help prevent colon cancer. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends routine colorectal screening for all adults between the ages of 50 and 75.","If you are healthy, your doctor will likely recommend removing the polyps to prevent cancer from developing or spreading. The choice of procedure depends on the polyps’ location, size, and whether they are cancerous. Before the procedure, you may need to fast, and your doctor may give you medicine to help you relax and reduce pain. Because of the sedation, arrange for someone else to drive you home.","Treatment provides a good outlook. If you do not get your polyps removed, they can continue to grow.

A sigmoidoscopy offers another way to remove polyps, while a colectomy—surgical removal of part of the colon—may be necessary if the polyps are large or cancerous.

The doctor can remove these polyps by inserting a speculum into your vagina to view the cervix, twisting off smaller polyps, or using electrocautery to burn off larger ones.

For stomach or throat polyps, the doctor performs an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy), guiding an endoscope down your throat to reach the affected area and remove the growths with a specialized tool.

During a laryngoscopy, the doctor inserts a laryngoscope through your mouth and removes the polyps with a small tool.

Because ear polyps are visible, the doctor can remove them directly with a small instrument.

After treatment you may notice minor bleeding, pain, or drowsiness from the sedative. Less common risks include infection or tears in nearby organs. Let your doctor know right away if you experience severe pain, fever, or persistent bleeding."
344,Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition caused by a traumatic event or series of events. It affects your mood and physical behavior. People who have PTSD have trouble coping with and recovering from traumatic events. You may have acute, or short-term,PTSD that can last for several months. You may have chronic, or long-term, PTSD that can last for several years.

PTSD can begin right after trauma or later.","Symptoms can include:

• Acting angry or violent
• Feeling anxious or edgy
• Having flashbacks, nightmares, bad memories, or hallucinations
• Being uninterested in daily life
• Feeling afraid or helpless
• Feeling numb or detached from others
• Trouble sleeping
• Not being able to recall parts of the traumatic event
• Avoiding people or things that remind you of the event

You may not recognize your symptoms or know what they mean. People who have PTSD often are depressed. Sometimes they try to feel better by using alcohol, drugs, or violent behaviors. This can lead to addiction and abuse.

Children who suffer from PTSD may have varied symptoms. These can include:

• Acting out or describing scary events, especially at playtime
• Having extreme temper tantrums, or overly violent behavior
• Forgetting how to talk or not being able to talk
• Becoming dependent on adults and not wanting to be left alone.","PTSD is caused by a traumatic event or series of events. The event(s) may have threatened your safety or your life. You may be at risk for PTSD if you are a:

• Soldier, veteran, prisoner of war, or victim of war
• Survivor of rape or domestic violence
• Survivor of sexual, physical, or verbal abuse or assault
• Survivor of an unexpected event, such as a terrorist attack or car wreck
• Survivor of a natural disaster, such as a fire, hurricane, or earthquake
• Front-line worker, such as a firefighter, police officer, or rescue worker
• Victim of bullying
• Person who has a life-threatening illness
• Person who has anxiety, depression, or a mental disorder
• Person who has experienced grief, such as the unexpected loss of a loved one.","Your doctor can diagnose PTSD. Talk to them if you have symptoms or experienced a traumatic event. You must have a range of symptoms for more than a month for it to be PTSD. If your symptoms occur for less than a month, you may have acute stress disorder (ASD).","Certain people have a higher risk of getting PTSD. Going through a traumatic event does not guarantee you will have PTSD. Some factors can help prevent or lower your risk of PTSD. These include:

• Talking to people or seeking support after the event
• Treating and managing previous or related health conditions, such as anxiety or depression
• Learning how to cope with trauma, especially if it occurs frequently in your line of work, such as when working as a firefighter","There are several options for treating and managing your PTSD. These depend on the type and severity you have. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce or relieve symptoms. These include mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antipsychotics.

Therapy also is a common treatment. Types of therapy include:

• Psychotherapy, or talk therapy
• Cognitive behavioral therapy
• Relational therapy
• Play therapy
• Exposure therapy
• Group therapy

A doctor or therapist can teach you techniques to control your PTSD. Getting a service animal, like a dog, can help ease your symptoms as well.","There is no cure for PTSD, but with therapy, you can reduce or eliminate symptoms. This depends on the type and severity you have. PTSD can be managed with ongoing treatment. Without treatment, it can last longer or get worse over time. It also can lead to violence or death. Learning more about PTSD can aid your recovery. Check in your community for help and support groups.

People who have PTSD may have related health conditions, such as:

• Anxiety
• Depression
• Personality disorder
• Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
• Substance abuse or an addiction

These other conditions need to be treated, as well. People who have PTSD need to be watched for signs of attempted suicide or violence toward others.","• Will my PTSD ever go away?

345,Postpartum Depression (PPD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/postpartum-depression/,"Postpartum depression is a mental health illness that affects women after giving birth. For some women, it is normal to feel the “baby blues” for a week or two after giving birth. With postpartum depression, feelings of sadness, loneliness, worthlessness, restlessness, and anxiety may last longer than two weeks.

After having a baby, many women have mood swings. One minute they feel happy, and the next minute they start to cry. They may feel a little depressed, have a hard time concentrating, lose their appetite, or find that they can’t sleep well, even when the baby is asleep. These symptoms usually start about 3 to 4 days after delivery and may last several days.

If you’re a new mother and have any of these symptoms, you may have the baby blues. The baby blues are considered a normal part of early motherhood and usually go away within 10 days after delivery.","The symptoms of postpartum depression affect your quality of life and include:

• Feeling sad or down often
• Frequent crying or tearfulness
• Feeling restless, irritable, or anxious
• Loss of interest or pleasure in life
• Loss of appetite
• Less energy and motivation to do things
• Difficulty sleeping, including trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, or sleeping more than usual
• Feeling worthless, hopeless, or guilty
• Unexplained weight loss or gain
• Feeling like life isn’t worth living
• Showing little interest in your baby
• Not feeling attached to your baby

Most women who develop postpartum depression do so right after childbirth; however, some women don’t begin to feel depressed until several weeks or months later. Depression that occurs within 6 months of childbirth may be postpartum depression.

In rare cases, a woman may develop postpartum psychosis. This is a very serious disease. It often includes many of the symptoms of postpartum depression along with delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Additionally postpartum depression may cause the mother to be at risk of hurting herself or her baby

What causes postpartum depression?

The exact cause isn’t known. Hormone levels change during pregnancy and right after childbirth. Those hormone changes may produce chemical changes in the brain. This plays a part in causing depression.

Postpartum depression is more likely to occur if you have had any of the following:

• Previous postpartum depression
• Depression not related to pregnancy
• Severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
• A difficult or very stressful marriage or relationship
• Few family members or friends to talk to or depend on
• Stressful life events during pregnancy or after childbirth (such as severe illness during pregnancy, premature birth, or a difficult delivery)",null,Schedule a visit with your doctor if you suspect you have postpartum depression. Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and feelings. He or she will ask you how long you have been feeling depressed. Your doctor may ask you to complete a questionnaire about your depression or order a blood test to check your hormone levels.,"Postpartum depression cannot be prevented or avoided. However, if you have a history of depression or postpartum depression after giving birth to other children, you can prepare. Preparation might include keeping your mind and body healthy. Eat healthy during your pregnancy, exercise, and learn stress reduction strategies. Once your baby is born, stay away from alcohol and caffeine. Continue to make healthy lifestyle decisions. See your doctor earlier in your pregnancy or sooner after giving birth if you are worried you will have postpartum depression.

Additionally, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends screening for depression in the general adult population. This includes pregnant and postpartum women. Screening efforts should focus on ensuring accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow up.","Postpartum depression is treated much like any other depression. Support, counseling (talk therapy), and prescription medicines (antidepressants) can help. Talk with your doctor about what treatment is best for you. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby, get help immediately. Call a suicide hotline, a friend, family member, or 911.

If you are breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking an antidepressant. Many antidepressant medicines are safe for breastfeeding infants. Your doctor can decide which medicine you can use while nursing your baby.

Most importantly, don’t assume there’s nothing you can do if you are suffering from postpartum depression. Help is available, and you can get better.","Feeling depressed doesn’t mean that you are a bad person. It doesn’t mean that you did something wrong or that you brought this on yourself. It also does not mean that you don’t love your baby. If you have given birth recently and are feeling sad, blue, anxious, irritable, tired, or have any of the other symptoms of postpartum depression, remember that many other women have had the same experience.

You’re not “losing your mind” or “going crazy.” You shouldn’t feel that you just have to suffer through it. Here are some things you can do that other mothers with postpartum depression have found helpful:

• Find someone to talk to and tell that person about your feelings.
• Get in touch with people who can help you with childcare, household chores, and errands. This support network will help you find time for yourself so you can rest.
• Find time to do something for yourself, even if it’s only 15 minutes a day. Try reading, exercising (walking is great for your health and is easy to do), taking a bath, or meditating.
• Keep a daily diary. Write down your emotions and feelings. This is a way to let out your thoughts and frustrations. Once you begin to feel better, you can go back and reread your diary. This will help you see how much better you are.
• Celebrate small achievements. Even if you can only get one thing done on any given day, remember that this is a step in the right direction. There may be days when you can’t get anything done. Try not to get angry with yourself when this happens.
• It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Childbirth brings many changes and parenting is challenging. When you’re not feeling like yourself, these changes can seem like too much to handle.
• You’re not expected to be a supermom. Be honest about how much you can do. Ask other people to help you when you need it.
• Find a support group in your area. They can put you in touch with people near you who have experience with postpartum depression.
• Talk with your doctor about how you feel. He or she may offer counseling and/or medicines that can help.","• Will I have to take antidepressants for life?
• If I take medicine, will I have trouble getting off the medicine when I feel better?
• How will I know if the medicine is making me feel better or if I’m naturally getting better?
• Will I have postpartum depression with every pregnancy?
• Who should I call if I am having thoughts of suicide or of harming my baby?","American Pregnancy Association: Baby Blues

346,Postpartum Preeclampsia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/postpartum-preeclampsia/,"Postpartum preeclampsia is high blood pressure in a woman who has recently had a baby. It can happen as early as a few days afterwards, or up to several weeks after having a baby. In addition to high blood pressure, a woman who has postpartum preeclampsia will also have too much protein in her urine. It is a rare medical condition.

Postpartum preeclampsia is different than preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is high blood pressure that happens while you are pregnant. Postpartum preeclampsia can only happen after the baby is born.","The main sign of postpartum preeclampsia is high blood pressure (140/90 millimeters of mercury — mm Hg). Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Other common symptoms include:

• New or unusual headaches (can be severe)
• Eye problems (blurry or loss of vision, sensitivity to light)
• A swollen face and limbs (arms and legs)
• Stomach pain near your ribs
• Nausea and vomiting
• Decreased urination
• Sudden weight gain (several pounds or more in a week)

Serious complications can include:

• Stroke
• Seizures
• Organ damage (kidneys, liver, brain)
• Fluid in your lungs
• Blood clots
• Red blood cell damage","The exact cause is unknown. However, your risk of getting it is higher if you had high blood pressure after the 20th week of your pregnancy. Other risk factors include obesity, a family history of high blood pressure, age (younger than 20 and older than 40), and being pregnant with multiple babies (twins, triplets, or more).","Your doctor will check your blood pressure before you leave the hospital after giving birth. It will be checked again at your post-birth doctor visits. If your doctor suspects you have the condition, a blood test and urine test can provide more information. A blood test involves inserting a small needle connected to a syringe into the vein in your arm to collect a sample of blood. A urine test involves peeing into a cup at a lab or doctor’s office. If your blood pressure is too high, your doctor may send you to the hospital for overnight observation.","This condition cannot be prevented or avoided. Know your body. If you have any of the symptoms listed, contact your doctor immediately.",Certain blood pressure medicines are used to treat this condition. The medicine will lower your blood pressure. Your doctor may also prescribe other medicine to prevent seizures. It is safe to take these medicines and breastfeed.,"Getting the right medicine and dosage will lower your blood pressure. It will help your symptoms go away. Depending on what medicine the doctor prescribes, it could take days to a few weeks for the medicine to lower your blood pressure to normal.","• Am I at risk of developing postpartum preeclampsia if I didn’t have high blood pressure during my pregnancy?

347,Prediabetes,https://familydoctor.org/condition/prediabetes/,"Prediabetes means your blood glucose (also called blood sugar) levels are higher than normal. When your blood glucose levels reach a certain level, you have diabetes. This is a disease that occurs when your body doesn’t make or use the hormone insulin properly. It causes too much glucose to build up in the blood. Too much glucose in your blood can be harmful to your body over time.

Prediabetes is when your blood glucose levels are too high, but not high enough to be called diabetes. People who develop type 2 diabetes usually have prediabetes first. If you have prediabetes, you are at much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You are also at risk of developing other health conditions, including heart disease, heart attack, or stroke.

If you have prediabetes, you can prevent or delay the onset of full-blown type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly.",Prediabetes usually doesn’t cause any symptoms. The only way to know you have it is if your blood sugar levels are tested.,"Prediabetes occurs when the insulin in your body doesn’t work as well as it should. Insulin helps the cells in your body use glucose from your blood. When the insulin doesn’t work properly, too much glucose builds up in your blood. Higher levels than normal can indicate prediabetes. If the levels get high enough, you develop type 2 diabetes. High glucose levels can damage your blood vessels and nerves over time. This increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health problems.

You are at risk for prediabetes if any of the following are true:

• You are overweight or have obesity.
• You have a parent or sibling who has diabetes.
• You had diabetes during pregnancy (called gestational diabetes) or have a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds at birth.
• You are African American, Native American, Latin American, or Asian/Pacific Islander.
• You have high blood pressure (above 140/90 mm Hg).
• Your HDL cholesterol level (“good” cholesterol) is too low (less than 40 mg per dL for men or 50 mg per dL for women), or your triglyceride level (specific fats) is higher than 250 mg per dL.
• You have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).","You should be tested for diabetes if you are age 45 or older. You should also be tested if you are younger than 45 and have any of the risk factors listed above.

Your doctor can order several tests to check for prediabetes. First, the doctor may want to test your “fasting blood sugar.” This is your blood sugar level before you eat in the morning. The ranges for the results of a fasting blood sugar test are:

• Normal = between 70 and 99 mg per dL
• Prediabetes = between 100 and 125 mg per dL
• Diabetes = higher than 126 mg per dL

Your doctor may also want to do an A1C blood test. This test provides information about your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. The results are reported as a percentage:

• Normal = below 5.7%
• Prediabetes = between 5.7% and 6.4%
• Diabetes = 6.5% or higher","Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be delayed and even prevented. Lifestyle changes like losing weight if you are overweight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly can help with this. The longer you have prediabetes or diabetes, the more health problems you may experience. Delaying or preventing the onset of the disease can help your health.

If I have prediabetes, can I avoid developing diabetes?

If you have prediabetes, the best way to avoid developing type 2 diabetes is by making changes in your lifestyle.

• Lose weight. If you are overweight, losing at least 7% of your starting weight can help delay or prevent diabetes. That means if you weigh 200 pounds, losing 14 pounds can make a big difference. Weight loss also helps lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
• Exercise regularly. Exercise is an important part of diabetes prevention. Your exercise routine should include 30 minutes of moderate physical activity at least 5 times a week. This could mean brisk walking, riding a bike, or swimming. Ask your doctor what exercise level is safe for you.
• Follow a healthy diet. Eat foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish or chicken, and low-fat dairy. Don’t eat a lot of processed, fried, or sugary foods. Eat smaller portions to reduce the number of calories you take in each day. Drink water instead of sweetened drinks.

Your doctor might refer you to a dietitian or diabetes educator to help you change your eating and exercise habits. Some people also take medicine to help prevent or delay diabetes. Ask your doctor if this is a good option for you.","The primary treatment for prediabetes is the same as what you would do to prevent diabetes: lose weight, exercise, and eat a healthy diet. These 3 things can help control your blood sugar levels and keep them from getting higher. In some cases, your blood sugar levels might decrease. It is possible to reverse prediabetes by making these lifestyle changes.

Can medicine help treat prediabetes?

Diabetes medicines are not as effective as diet and exercise. However, your doctor might prescribe medicine if you are at high risk for diabetes or have other medical problems. These could include obesity, a high triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, or high blood pressure.","When you’re living with prediabetes, you should focus on preventing full-blown diabetes. The best ways to do this are by losing weight, eating right, and exercising regularly. But these lifestyle changes can be hard. Here are some tips to help you make changes successfully.

Changing to a healthy lifestyle takes time and effort. But you don’t have to make all the changes at once. Start small, such as switching from drinking soda to drinking water. Once you’ve made the change, celebrate your progress. Then move on to the next change you need to make. It may take a while but keep moving forward. Your lifestyle will continue to improve, and so will your health. Even if you do not lose weight, making these lifestyle changes does make you healthier.

Don’t let setbacks derail you.

Nobody is perfect. It can be easy to slide back into old habits. If you slip up and have a setback, move back to your healthy habit as soon as you can. You might take one step backward sometimes, but as long as you keep moving forward, your health will improve.

It’s harder to do things by yourself. Find other people who are trying to make the same changes you are. They can provide encouragement and new ideas for you to try as you support each other. They also make you more accountable for your decisions. It’s a lot harder to skip a workout when you have someone who is waiting to do it with you.

Learn how to make healthier food decisions at the grocery store, in the kitchen, and when eating out. The more you know about how food works in your body and what you should be eating, the easier it is to make healthy choices for yourself. Your doctor may recommend nutritional counseling or a visit with a dietitian. They can help you break your old habits and learn how to live healthier.

The day-to-day decisions you need to make can be hard. But in the long run, they add up to make you a much healthier person. Prediabetes can be controlled and even reversed through hard work, focus, and good choices. You are changing your life, one step at a time.","• If I have prediabetes, what is the chance that I will get diabetes?

348,Preeclampsia | Preeclampsia During Pregnancy,https://familydoctor.org/condition/preeclampsia/,"Preeclampsia is a condition women can get when pregnant. It is sometimes called toxemia. It occurs when women who are pregnant have an increase in blood pressure along with signs of organ damage (most often to the kidneys or liver, but sometimes the lungs or other organs). Preeclampsia usually begins after the 20th week of pregnancy.

Preeclampsia can prevent the placenta (which gives oxygen and nutrients to your baby) from getting enough blood. If the placenta doesn’t get enough blood, your baby gets less oxygen and nutrients. This can cause low birth weight and other problems for the baby.

In some cases, women can get preeclampsia after having their baby. This is called postpartum preeclampsia.

It’s very important to see your doctor for routine prenatal visits. Preeclampsia is usually detected early in women who get regular prenatal care, and most problems can be prevented. However, if the condition doesn’t get diagnosed or treated, it can have harmful effects on the mother and/or baby.

Note: Just because you have high blood pressure while pregnant doesn’t mean you have preeclampsia. If your doctor sees your blood pressure is high, they will watch you closely for changes. In addition to high blood pressure, preeclampsia sometimes also causes excessive swelling. Women with preeclampsia may also have protein in their urine. Many women who have high blood pressure during pregnancy don’t have protein in their urine or extreme swelling, and don’t get preeclampsia.","Most women who have preeclampsia don’t know they have it. Symptoms either don’t exist or are mild. They include swelling and rapid weight gain (more than 2 pounds a week).

• Headache
• Abdominal pain
• Shortness of breath
• Chest pain
• Dizziness
• Confusion

Severe symptoms are less common and can be confused with normal pregnancy symptoms.

• Nausea and vomiting
• Constant headache
• Trouble breathing
• Smaller amounts of urine, or no urine
• Vision changes, such as blurry vision, light sensitivity, flashing lights, spots, or brief blindness
• Stomach pain on the right side below your ribs","There is no exact cause of preeclampsia. Women who have autoimmune disorders or blood vessel problems may be more likely to develop preeclampsia. Doctors believe it may also be related to a woman’s genes and diet.

The following conditions could put you at greater risk:

• First pregnancy
• Multiples pregnancy (two babies or more)
• 35 years of age or older
• Personal history of preeclampsia
• Family history of preeclampsia
• History of high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney disease
• Autoimmune disorders
• Blood vessel problems
• Obesity
• IVF (in vitro fertilization) or fertility treatments","During pregnancy, you should visit your doctor for regular checkups and exams. The doctor will check for signs of preeclampsia. This includes checking your blood pressure and weight. You also will be asked to leave a urine sample. Your doctor may also do a blood test. Other tests may be done to check your and the baby’s health, if needed. These can determine if your condition is mild or severe","Warning signs of severe preeclampsia may include: • Vaginal bleeding (sign of placental abruption) • Buildup of fluid in the mother’s lungs • High levels of protein in urine, as well as low urine output • Poor kidney function • Abnormal liver function • Low platelet count Can preeclampsia be prevented or avoided. You cannot avoid preeclampsia. You may be able to help prevent it by focusing on better health before you get pregnant. This includes managing chronic conditions, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding use of tobacco, illicit drugs, and alcohol. Most women who have preeclampsia still deliver healthy babies. A few develop a condition called eclampsia (preeclampsia with seizures), which is very serious for the mother and baby, or other serious problems. The only way to cure preeclampsia is to deliver your baby. However, that might not always be possible. Your doctor will discuss the best option based on your length of pregnancy and the state of your condition. If you are less than 34 weeks along and your condition is mild, the doctor likely will monitor your symptoms. This may mean more frequent doctor visits to check your blood pressure and urine. The doctor may give you orders to help manage symptoms at home. For example: • Drink more water. • Eat less salt. In some cases, your doctor may want to monitor you and your baby from the hospital. The doctor may prescribe steroid injections to speed up the growth of your baby’s lungs. Once the doctor thinks your baby is developed enough, they will schedule delivery. If you are 37 weeks or more along and/or have severe preeclampsia, your doctor likely will want to deliver your baby right away. To do this, they may induce you (give you medicine or break your water) to start labor or order a C-section.",null,null,"• Am I at risk of having preeclampsia?

• Guilty feelings
• Depression
• Stress
• Relationship problems
• Erectile dysfunction

They will also be able to answer your questions and reassure you that this is a common problem.","This condition can be prevented or avoided, depending on what is causing it. Most of the time, using the behavioral methods listed below will work to prevent it.

This condition can be prevented or avoided, depending on what is causing it. Most of the time, using the behavioral methods listed below will work to prevent it.","Several medical treatments may help people who have this condition. Some antidepressants seem to help delay ejaculation, including antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These antidepressants are available with your doctor’s prescription. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of these medicines to treat premature ejaculation. Also, antidepressants may cause side effects such as nausea, dry mouth and drowsiness. Antidepressants may also decrease your desire to have sex. Your doctor can help you decide if an antidepressant is right for you.

Medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction may also help prevent this condition. Your doctor may prescribe one of these medicines alone or in combination with an antidepressant.

Anesthetic creams can also be used to prevent premature ejaculation. These creams are applied to the head of the penis to make it less sensitive. Usually, the cream is applied about 30 minutes before sex and then washed off once it has decreased the feeling in your penis. The cream must be washed off before sex. If it is left on, it can cause a loss of erection and vaginal numbness.

For some people, simply wearing a condom can help delay ejaculation because it may make the penis slightly less sensitive.","Premature ejaculation is very common. But if it happens frequently, talk to your doctor. There are many techniques you can use that may help prevent it. You should also talk to your partner. Often, they may feel responsible or disconnected. Talking about it can help put both of you more at ease. Also, your partner can help with the strategies described above for controlling your ejaculation.","• What can I do to stop myself from ejaculating so quickly?
• Is there a medicine that I can take that will help?
• I’m embarrassed by this—is there someone I can talk to about it?
• Premature ejaculation is causing problems in my relationship; should we go to counseling?
• Should I wear a condom when I have sex?
• Is there an underlying problem that could be causing my premature ejaculation?","American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists

In this type of treatment, you practice controlling your ejaculation, either alone or with a partner.

In the start-and-stop method, you or your partner will stimulate your penis until you feel like you are about to have an orgasm. Then the stimulation stops for about 30 seconds. Once you regain control of your response, stimulation begins again. This process is repeated 3 or 4 times before you allow yourself to have an orgasm.

• The squeeze method works in a similar way. When you feel like you are about to ejaculate, you or your partner will gently squeeze the head of your penis for about 30 seconds so that you begin to lose your erection. You repeat this process several times before you allow yourself to reach orgasm.

In addition to using a behavioral method, you may want to try thought distractions. For example, while you’re being sexually stimulated, think about the names of players on your favorite sports team.

Anxiety, depression, and other emotional issues can lead to premature ejaculation. For these issues, seeking the help of a psychologist, psychiatrist, or sex therapist may be helpful. Couples therapy may also help if relationship problems may be the cause."
350,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,https://familydoctor.org/condition/premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/,"PMDD is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. PMS is a common problem for women who have menstrual periods. About 75% of women of childbearing age have some PMS problems. About 2% to 10% of women in this age group have PMDD.","Many women may wonder if they have PMS or if it is PMDD because the symptoms are similar. The symptoms for both begin about 10-14 days before your period. But the symptoms of PMDD are more extreme and can spill over into other areas of your life. You may feel they are uncontrollable.

The symptoms of PMS and PMDD are:

• Sadness and crying
• Feeling nervous or anxious
• Anger or irritability
• Strong cravings for certain foods
• Problems paying attention and concentrating
• Fatigue
• Physical problems such as breast tenderness, headaches, joint or muscle pain, and swelling or bloating
• Trouble sleeping

It is largely the emotional symptoms that are more severe when you have PMDD. You may have more severe depression symptoms, irritability, and tension, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

These symptoms can affect your relationships and ability to do your job. If you have some of these symptoms a few weeks before your period and they improve when your period starts, you may have PMDD.

Severity scoring for each symptom:

1= Minimal or slightly apparent to you

2 = Moderate, awareness of symptom but does not affect your daily routine

3 = A lot, continuously bothered by the symptom and/or symptoms interferes with your daily routine

4 = Severe, symptom is overwhelming and/or unable to carry out your daily routine

Adapted with permission from Freeman EW, DeRubeis RJ, Rickels K. Reliability and validity of a daily diary for premenstrual syndrome. Psychiatry Res 1996; 65:97-106.",The exact cause of PMDD is not known. Changes in hormones related to your period may cause PMDD.,"Your doctor will check your symptoms and the way they relate to your menstrual cycle. You might fill out a symptom chart for several weeks. There is no test that can diagnose PMDD.

To help diagnose PMDD, your family doctor may ask you to chart your symptoms (see sample chart below).","Stressful life events and a family history of PMS or PMDD may increase your chances of getting PMDD. Major depression is common in women who have PMDD. However, not all women who have PMDD have major depression.","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and will discuss different treatments with you. For mild to moderate symptoms, your doctor may suggest changes in your diet and lifestyle. You might talk to a counselor about your PMDD symptoms and life stresses. Medicines may help with severe symptoms.

• Eat healthy foods with whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and little or no salt, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine.
• Get regular aerobic exercise throughout the month to reduce the severity of PMS symptoms.
• If you have problems sleeping, try changing your sleep habits before taking medicines for insomnia.

As you incorporate these changes into your life, keep a diary or calendar to record the type of symptoms you are having, how severe they are, and how long they last.

• Some prescription antidepressants may be helpful. The most common is an antidepressant known as a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). You can take SSRIs in the second part of your cycle up until your period starts. You may also take it the whole month. Talk to your doctor about your options.
• Birth control pills. These typically help reduce PMS symptoms. Continuous dosing types (ones containing medication without any non-medication days) are the most effective, especially those that contain the hormone, drospirenone. With continuous dosing, you may not get a period.
• This medicine reduces water retention, which often occurs during the menstrual cycle and can cause pain and discomfort.
• Depo-Lupron. This prescription medicine suppresses the ovaries and ovulation and mimics menopause. This means you will not have a period while you are taking the medicine.
• Over-the-counter pain medicines, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. However, if you are young and regularly takin ibuprofen for the relief of PMS, talk to your doctor about the long-term damage that can occur to your kidneys.
• Nutritional supplements, such as vitamin B6, calcium, and magnesium are not helpful in relieving symptoms.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be used either with or instead of antidepressants. During CBT, you have about 10 visits with a mental health professional over several weeks to months.","Trying to cope with the severe symptoms of PMDD without treatment can make you miserable. It can also make those around you miserable.

Do not feel as though it is up to you to manage PMDD by yourself. Your symptoms are real, and you are not alone. If you believe you have PMDD, the best thing you can do is talk to your doctor.","• Do I have PMDD or PMS?
• What is the difference between PMDD and PMS?
• What treatment is best for me?
• Will I have to take medicine until menopause?
• Could I also have depression?
• What are the side effects of my medicine?
• How long will I have to take my medicine?

351,Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),https://familydoctor.org/condition/premenstrual-syndrome-pms/,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is the name for a group of symptoms that you may experience up to 14 days before your period (menstruation). The symptoms usually stop soon after your period starts.

About half of women who experience PMS also have another health problem, which may get worse in the time before their menstrual period. These health problems share many symptoms with PMS, including:

• Depression and anxiety disorders
• Myaligic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome
• Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
• Bladder pain syndrome
• PMS may also worsen other health problems, such as asthma, allergies, and migraines

Diuretics help your body get rid of extra sodium and fluid. They can ease bloating, weight gain, breast pain, and abdominal pain. Diuretics usually are taken just before you would normally experience these symptoms in your menstrual cycle and can be stopped when they are no longer needed.","Most women feel some mild discomfort before their periods. But if you have PMS, you may feel so anxious, depressed, or uncomfortable that you can’t cope at home or at work. Your PMS symptoms may be worse some months and better others.

It is common for you to have some of these symptoms:

• Back pain
• Bloated abdomen
• Changes in appetite, including cravings for certain foods
• Constipation
• Crying spells
• Diarrhea
• Depression
• Fast heartbeat
• Feeling irritable, tense, or anxious
• Feeling tired
• Headache
• Hot flashes
• Joint pain
• Mood swings
• Not feeling as interested in sex
• Tender and swollen breasts
• Trouble concentrating
• Trouble sleeping
• Swollen hands or feet
• Wanting to be alone
• Weight gain

If your PMS symptoms are severe, you may have a condition called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This is especially true if your anxiety and depression feelings are extreme.

• Eat complex carbohydrates (such as whole grains and whole-grain breads, pasta, and cereals), fiber, and protein. Cut back on sugar and fat.
• Avoid salt for the last few days before your period to reduce bloating and fluid retention.
• Cut back on caffeine to feel less tense and irritable and to ease breast soreness.
• Avoid alcohol. Drinking it before your period can make you feel more depressed.
• Try eating up to 6 small meals a day instead of 3 larger ones.
• Get aerobic exercise. Work out up to 30 minutes, 4 to 6 times a week.
• Get plenty of sleep—about 8 hours a night.
• Keep to a regular schedule of meals, bedtime, and exercise.
• Try to schedule stressful events for the week after your period.","No one knows for sure what causes PMS. It seems to be linked in part to changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. PMS is not caused by stress or psychological problems, although these may make PMS symptoms worse.","Your doctor will ask you to keep track of your symptoms on a calendar. If your symptoms follow the same pattern each month, you may have PMS.

Your doctor may want to examine you and do some tests to rule out other possible problems. They may also want to talk about your eating habits, exercise habits, your work, and your family.","PMS can sometimes be prevented by controlling hormone fluctuations with hormone-containing contraceptives, for example. For some women, eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly may ease PMS symptoms.","There is no cure for PMS, but taking medicine may help. No single PMS treatment works for everyone, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, to help ease cramps, headaches, backaches, and breast tenderness. Depending on your PMS symptoms and how severe they are, your doctor may prescribe medicine for you.

You may need to try more than one medicine to find the treatment that works best for you. Medicines that your doctor can prescribe include diuretics, antidepressants, and birth control pills.

You may have read that some vitamins and other supplements, such as vitamin B6, vitamin E, magnesium, manganese, and tryptophan, can help relieve PMS. There haven’t been many studies about these treatments, and it’s possible that they could do more harm than good. For example, vitamin B6 and vitamin E can cause side effects if you take too much of them. Talk to your doctor if you’re thinking of trying any of these vitamins or supplements.

On the other hand, taking calcium pills may reduce symptoms of water retention, cramps, and back pain. Taking about 1,000 mg of calcium a day probably won’t be harmful, especially because calcium has so many other benefits, such as being good for your bones.","Managing your PMS begins with knowing what your PMS symptoms are and when they happen. Then you can change your diet, exercise, and schedule to get through each month as smoothly as possible.

Try not to get discouraged if it takes some time to find tips or medicine that help you. Treatment varies from one person to another. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment.","• Could my symptoms be caused by something other than PMS?

These medicines are usually taken every day, even when you feel fine.

Your doctor may talk to you about taking birth control pills (often just called “the pill”) or other hormone-containing contraceptives to help ease some of your PMS symptoms. Birth control pills help by evening out your hormone levels throughout your cycle. Some women’s PMS symptoms get a lot better when they take birth control pills. However, the pill can also cause side effects of its own, and it doesn’t help all women.

You can buy medicines without a prescription to help with the symptoms of PMS. These medicines usually combine aspirin or acetaminophen with caffeine, antihistamines, or diuretics. Some brand names include Midol, Pamprin, and Premsyn PMS.

Some over-the-counter pain relievers can also help. These include ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin), ketoprofen (brand name: Orudis KT), and naproxen (brand name: Aleve).

352,Prescription Drug Abuse in the Elderly,https://familydoctor.org/condition/prescription-drug-abuse-in-the-elderly/,"Prescription drug abuse is when people misuse prescribed medicines. They may abuse their own medicine in a way that is not instructed by the doctor. This includes taking more medicine than they need or taking it when they don’t need it. Or they may abuse a prescription that is meant for someone else. Prescription drug abuse also can occur when people mix medicine with alcohol or other drugs.

Prescription drug abuse is also a term that refers to the improper use of medicines that are categorized as controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Examples include medicines that doctors prescribe to treat pain, anxiety, or sleep. This can lead to serious problems, such as drug interactions, addiction, or even overdose. A drug interaction occurs when two or more drugs react with each other. It could make drugs less effective or cause harmful side effects.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","A person can abuse any type of prescription drug. Elderly adults commonly take 2 types of medicines that have a high potential for misuse and/or abuse.

• Opioidsare used to control pain. Examples include oxycodone (OxyContin), oxycodone with acetaminophen (Percocet), and hydrocodone with acetaminophen (Vicodin). A person can develop opioid misuse if they take an opioid for a long period of time or take too much of an opioid.
• Benzodiazepinesare used to treat anxiety, panic attacks, or insomnia. Examples include diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), and lorazepam (Ativan). A person can develop misuse or abuse if they take the drug for a long period of time.

Symptoms of prescription drug abuse can be hard to recognize in older adults. This is because they are similar to symptoms of aging. For instance, confusion and memory loss are symptoms of both.

If you care for or spend time with an older adult, be aware of their medicines and behavior. The following are warning signs that someone may be abusing prescription drugs. If they:

• Get a prescription for the same medicine from two different doctors
• Fill a prescription for the same medicine at two different pharmacies
• Take more of a medicine than they used to or take more than is instructed on the label
• Take the medicine at different times or more often than is instructed on the label
• Become more withdrawn or angry
• Appear confused or forgetful
• Often talk about a medicine
• Are afraid to go somewhere without taking a medicine
• Are defensive when you ask about a medicine
• Make excuses for why they need a medicine
• Store “extra” pills in their purse or in their pocket
• Sneak or hide medicine
• Have been treated for alcohol, drug, or prescription drug abuse in the past

If you suspect that an older adult is abusing a prescription drug, contact their doctor right away. Tell them about your concerns. The doctor will likely make an appointment to evaluate the person. They can diagnose if the problem is prescription drug abuse. The doctor also will help determine treatment.

Treatment options for prescription drug abuse vary by person. It depends on what drug is abused, the degree of abuse, and the risk of having a withdrawal of the drug. Treatment may include counseling, medicine, or both."
353,Pressure Sores,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pressure-sores/,"Pressure sores are sores on your skin. They’re caused by being in a bed or wheelchair nearly all the time. Sometimes they’re called bedsores or pressure ulcers. The sores usually develop over the bony parts of your body. Those are places with little padding from fat. Sores are common on heels and hips. Other areas include the base of the spine (tailbone), shoulder blades, the backs and sides of the knees, and the back of the head.

People who need to stay in bed or in a wheelchair for a long time are at greater risk of developing pressure sores. This can include people who are paralyzed and those who aren’t able to get up on their own. But even some people with short-term illness and injuries can get pressure sores. Sores can happen if they have to stay in bed or a wheelchair while they heal. Lastly, some chronic (long-lasting) diseases make it hard for pressure sores to heal. Those include diabetes and hardening of the arteries.","• Thick, yellow, or green pus
• A bad smell coming from the sore
• Redness or skin that is warm to the touch
• Swelling around the sore
• Tenderness around the sore

• Fever
• Chills
• Confusion or difficulty concentrating
• Rapid heartbeat
• Weakness","Pressure sores are caused by sitting or lying in one position for too long. It’s important to know that a pressure sore can start quickly. In fact, a Stage 1 sore can occur if you stay in the same position for as little as 2 hours. This puts pressure on certain areas of your body. It reduces blood supply to the skin and the tissue under the skin. If you don’t change position frequently, the blood supply will drop. A sore will develop.","Your doctor will do a physical exam to look at the sores. They will examine the size and depth of the sore and look to see if blood or fluid is oozing from the sore. Your doctor will check to see if your sore has a bad smell. They also will check for additional sores.

Testing may help to diagnose pressure sores or their complications. These tests might include a blood test. Another test would be to take a sample of the tissue from the sore. This is done by scraping or cutting it from the sore. That sample is sent to the lab for examination.","The best way to prevent pressure sores is to avoid spending long periods of time in a chair, wheelchair, or bed. If you’re unable to move on your own, make arrangements for somebody—such as a family member, friend, or caregiver—to help you move.

If you must spend a lot of time in a chair, wheelchair, or bed, check your entire body daily. Look for spots, color changes, or other signs of sores. Pay attention to the pressure points where sores are most likely to occur. Again, if you’re unable to look on your own, ask someone to help you.

Another way to avoid pressure sores is to keep your skin healthy. This includes keeping it clean and dry. Wash it with mild soap and warm water. Don’t use hot water. Apply lotion often.

Even small amounts of exercise can help prevent pressure sores. That’s because exercise improves blood flow, strengthens your muscles, and improves your overall health. Talk to your doctor if physical activity is difficult. They can suggest certain exercises. Your doctor also may refer you to a physical therapist. They can show you how to do exercises that fit with your current health condition.

Lastly, if you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your risk of pressure sores.","Treatment depends on the seriousness of the sore. If the sore is infected, you may be able to treat it by applying an antibiotic cream to the area. If bone or deeper tissues are infected, you may require antibiotics. These may be taken by mouth (orally) or by a shot or IV (injection).

Other things that can help include:

• Move often. When in bed, change your position at least every 2 hours. If you’re sitting, change positions every 15 minutes. Ask for help, if needed.
• Use foam pads or pillows to take pressure off the sore. Special mattresses, mattress covers, foam wedges, or seat cushions provide support in bed or in a chair. When in bed, avoid resting directly on your hip bone when you’re lying on your side. It can help to use pillows under one side so that your weight rests on the fatty part of your buttocks instead of on your hip bone. If you’re lying on your back, place a pillow under your lower calves to lift your ankles slightly off the bed.
• Sit upright and straight when sitting in a chair or wheelchair. This allows you to move more easily and help prevent new sores.
• Improve your nutrition.This helps heal the sores.
• Maintain good hygiene. Stage 1 sores can be cleaned with mild soap and water. Clean stage 2 sores with a salt and water solution. The saltwater removes extra fluid and loose material. Your doctor or nurse can show you how to clean stage 1 and 2 pressure sores. Your doctor or nurse will likely need to clean stage 3 and 4 pressure sores because of their seriousness.","Living with pressure sores requires a plan to move and turn frequently. Good hygiene will always be required. Pressure sores should be kept covered with a bandage or dressing. Sometimes gauze is used. The gauze must be changed once a day. Newer materials include a see-through film and a hydrocolloid dressing. A hydrocolloid dressing is a bandage made of a gel. It molds to the pressure sore and promotes healing and skin growth. These dressings can stay on for several days at a time.

Dead tissue in the sore can interfere with healing and lead to infection. Dead tissue looks like a scab. To remove dead tissue, rinse the sore every time you change the bandage. Special dressings can help your body dissolve the dead tissue on its own. The dressing must be left in place for several days. Another way to remove dead tissue is to put wet gauze bandages on the sore. Allow them to dry. The dead tissue sticks to the gauze until it is removed. For severe pressure sores, dead tissue must be removed surgically by your doctor.

Removing dead tissue and cleaning the sore can hurt. Your doctor can suggest a pain medicine. Take it 30 to 60 minutes before changing the dressing.

Healthy eating helps sores heal. Make sure you’re eating the proper number of calories and protein every day. Nutrients are important too, including vitamin C and zinc. Ask your doctor for advice on a healthy diet. Be sure to tell them if you’ve lost or gained weight recently.

As pressure sores heal, they get smaller. Less fluid drains from them. New, healthy tissue starts growing at the bottom of the sore. This new tissue is light red or pink. It looks lumpy and shiny. Treatment may take 2 to 4 weeks before you see signs of healing.","• What should I do if I or a loved one has pressure sores and is too heavy to move?
• Does an adjustable bed help reduce the risk of pressure sores?
• Can you die from an infected pressure sore?
• Is diabetic foot ulcer the same as a pressure sore?
• Can you get pressure sores from sitting in the same position in your job for longer than 2 hours at a time?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Pressure Sores

During this stage, the area of the sore looks red. It may feel warm to the touch. It may burn, hurt, or itch. The pressure sore may look blue or purple in people who have dark skin.
• Stage 2. During this stage, the area is more damaged. The sore may be open. It may look like a cut or blister. The skin around the sore may be discolored. The sore is painful.
• Stage 3. During this stage, the sore will have a crater-like look. This is due to increased damage below the surface. This makes the wound deeper.
• Stage 4. This is the most serious stage. Skin and tissue are severely damaged. The sore becomes a large wound. Infection is possible. You’re likely able to see muscle, bones, tendons, and joints.

Infected pressure sores take a long time to heal. Also, the infection can spread to the rest of your body."
354,Prostate Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/prostate-cancer/,"Prostate cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in a man’s prostate gland. The prostate gland is part of a man’s reproductive system. It makes a fluid that mixes with sperm and other fluids during ejaculation. A normal-size prostate is about the size of a walnut.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Most types of prostate cancer grow slowly. However, some types can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, doctors say the cancer has “metastasized.”","Prostate cancer, especially in its early stages, often doesn’t have any symptoms. Symptoms usually appear as the cancer grows. Those can include:

• Difficulty urinating
• A weak urine stream
• Dribbling after you finish urinating
• A need to urinate often, especially at night
• Pain during urination
• Blood in the urine or semen
• Difficulty having or maintaining an erection
• Pain with ejaculation
• Pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, pelvis, and upper thighs
• Unplanned weight loss and/or loss of appetite","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes prostate cancer. However, they do know that certain risk factors may increase your risk for the disease. These include:

• Older age. Men of any age can get prostate cancer. However, it’s most common in men older than 65 years of age.
• Black men are more likely to develop prostate cancer than Caucasian men.
• Family history. Men who have had a father or brother with prostate cancer are at increased risk of developing the disease.
• Men with obesity who are diagnosed with prostate cancer are more likely to have an advanced or aggressive cancer.","Prostate cancer is diagnosed with a biopsy of the prostate. A biopsy is usually done if symptoms or a screening raises concern. A prostate cancer screening is a test your doctor uses to look for the disease before you have symptoms. There are two screening tests available: a digital rectal exam (DRE) and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. You and your doctor will decide if you need a screening. However, these tests can only tell your doctor whether your prostate is healthy. Abnormal test results don’t always mean you have cancer. How often you should be screened depends on your age and your personal risk factors.

During a DRE, your doctor will insert their gloved, lubricated finger a few inches into your rectum to feel your prostate gland. A normal prostate feels firm. If there are hard spots on the prostate, your doctor may suggest additional testing to check for prostate cancer.

During a PSA test, you will get a blood test. A blood test involves inserting a small needle into a vein in your arm to take a sample of blood. The test measures the level of PSA (a substance produced by the prostate) in your blood. Men who have prostate cancer may have a higher level of PSA in their blood. However, a PSA level can also be high because of less serious causes, such as infection or an enlarged prostate.

If your screening test results are abnormal, your doctor may recommend additional other tests to check for cancer. Those tests may include:

• A transrectal ultrasound provides your doctor with a look at your prostate. During the test, a small probe is inserted into your rectum. This probe sends out sound waves (called ultrasound) that bounce off your prostate. A computer uses the sound waves to create a picture of your prostate.
• During a biopsy, your doctor removes a very small piece of your prostate to check it for cancer cells. A biopsy is a reliable way to diagnose prostate cancer. During the biopsy, your doctor will insert a needle into your prostate to collect tissue from your prostate. Your doctor may take tissue samples from several different areas of your prostate.

If your biopsy is normal, you don’t have prostate cancer. Talk to your doctor about whether another condition may have caused your symptoms or your high PSA level. Ask your doctor how often you should have checkups.

If your biopsy results are positive for cancer, your doctor will grade and stage the cancer.

Grading tells you how aggressive (fast-growing) the cancer is. Higher grade cancers are more likely to grow and spread. A common system of grading is called the Gleason score. Gleason scores range from 2 (not aggressive) to 10 (very aggressive).

Staging tells you how advanced the cancer is. Also, it tells you how far it has spread. To determine the stage, your doctor may order imaging tests such as ultrasound, bone scan, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Stages I and II mean the cancer was caught early and hasn’t spread outside the prostate. Stages III and IV mean the cancer has spread to nearby tissues, organs, or to other body parts.

Some medical professionals argue that screening isn’t necessary. For people who have fast-growing (aggressive) tumors, catching it early can help. Cancer is usually easier to treat and more likely to be cured when caught early. However, most cases aren’t fast-growing.

Another argument is that PSA tests aren’t always accurate. In fact, a significant number of PSA tests are false positives. This causes unnecessary worry and expense for men who get the false positives. For these reasons, some medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), recommend against routine PSA screening for men of all ages. Talk to your doctor. Consider the pros and cons of screening, your health, individual risk factors, your preferences regarding diagnosis and treatment, and your doctor’s opinion and advice.","Some risk factors, such as family history and hormone levels, can’t be prevented. However, your weight, physical activity, and diet may lower your risk for prostate cancer. Work toward a healthy lifestyle by eating the recommended daily amount of fruits and vegetables, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight (or losing weight, if you need to).","Prostate cancer treatment depends on your age, your overall health, and the grade and stage of your cancer. If you have prostate cancer, your doctor will need to monitor the growth of your cancer. Fast-growing tumors can quickly spread to other organs in the body. This makes treatment more difficult. Men who have slow-growing tumors may not need treatment for a long time. Some never need treatment.

Common treatment options include the following:

• Watchful waiting. During watchful waiting, you have no treatment, but you see your doctor often. During this time, your doctor will monitor the growth of your cancer through blood tests, rectal exams, and biopsies. If there’s no sign the cancer is growing, you continue to have no treatment.
• Radiation therapy. There are 2 types of radiation therapy. One type is called external (beam) radiation therapy. With this type, radiation is given from a machine like an X-ray machine. The other type is called internal radiation therapy. With this type, radioactive pellets (called “seeds”) are injected into the prostate gland. This is sometimes called seed therapy or brachytherapy. Both types have about the same results in curing prostate cancer. Sometimes, both are used together. The external beam radiation therapy usually takes about 10 minutes. It is given 5 days a week over 6 to 8 weeks. Some people might find this time consuming. However, you don’t need any anesthesia for this kind of treatment. Side effects are milder than the side effects that can occur with seed therapy. Seed therapy can be done with just one hospital visit. Seed therapy requires anesthesia (medicine that eliminates pain by making you relax or sleep). However, you should be able to go home right after the treatment. In seed therapy, higher doses of radiation can be put right into the cancer. You may feel more discomfort after this treatment.
• Radical prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the whole prostate gland. Nearby lymph nodes also are removed. After the prostate gland is removed through an incision, a catheter (a narrow rubber tube) is put through the penis into the bladder to carry urine out of the body until the area heals. There are also other techniques to surgically remove the prostate. Each type has different risks and recovery times.
• Hormone therapy. Hormone therapy lowers the level of male hormones, called androgens. These hormones are produced mostly in a man’s testicles. Androgens such as testosterone cause the prostate tumor to grow. Androgen deprivation or suppression shots or pills can be given over a period of several months. Surgery may be required to remove the testicles. Once the level of androgens is sufficiently reduced, the prostate cancer usually shrinks, and new growth slows down. Hormone treatments are often used in combination with other kinds of prostate cancer treatments. However, hormone therapy does not cure prostate cancer.
• This therapy uses drugs to damage cancer cells and make it difficult for them to grow in number. This medicine is delivered to your body through an intravenous (IV) drip. Chemotherapy is given over the course of weeks or months, depending on the severity of your prostate cancer. It has many notable side effects. The most common side effects are nausea and hair loss.

There are risks and benefits of each type of therapy.

Radiation therapy. Older studies show that about one-half of patients develop erectile dysfunction (also called impotence, which is the loss of the ability to get or keep an erection long enough to have sex) within 5 years of having radiation therapy. However, newer forms of radiation may have different outcomes:

• Many men feel very tired at the end of the treatment period.
• Erectile dysfunction (impotence) is a common side effect and often gets worse over time.
• Some men have side effects like urinary burning, urinary bleeding, frequent urination, rectal bleeding, rectal discomfort, or diarrhea during or shortly after the treatment.
• More serious complications are rare. However, a degree of uncertainty goes along with radiation treatment. Since the prostate gland and the lymph nodes aren’t taken out, your doctor can’t tell the exact size of the tumor. The cancer could come back many years after radiation treatment.

Radical prostatectomy. The short-term risks of this surgery are low if you’re young and in good health:

• The hospital stay is usually 2 to 3 days.
• The catheter is left in place for 2 to 3 weeks.
• You’re usually able to go back to work in about 1 month.
• You shouldn’t have severe pain with this surgery.
• Most men regain bladder control a few weeks to several months after the surgery.
• The biggest advantage is that it offers the most positive outcome. This is true if all the cancer is removed during surgery.
• The surgery provides your doctor with accurate information about how advanced your cancer is since the nearby lymph nodes are taken out along with the tumor.

The main risks of radical prostatectomy are incontinence (loss of bladder control) and impotence.

Hormone therapy. Hormone therapy often is used in combination with other treatments. It does have side effects:

• Serious side effects include loss of sex drive, weakened bones, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and osteoporosis.
• Hormone treatments may be used in patients who have cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland. While prostate cancer that has spread usually responds to 1 or 2 years of hormone therapy, it doesn’t cure the disease and most tumors eventually begin to grow again. Once this happens, the treatment goal is to control symptoms.

Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy has been shown to help some people who have advanced prostate cancer live longer.

Chemotherapy can have many side effects, including hair loss, nausea, fatigue, and loss of taste.","Living with prostate cancer depends on how early you were diagnosed. Also, it depends on the type of treatment you received. For example, if you had to have your prostate removed, you may have to live with sexual dysfunction. If you had hormone or chemotherapy, you may have long-term effects from the medicines used on those treatments. Ask your doctor how you can improve the quality of your life after treatment.","• What could cause an enlarged prostate, other than cancer?
• At what age should I start screening for prostate cancer?
• How often should I get screened?
• Will I have a normal sex life after my prostate surgery?
• What are the long-term side effects of chemotherapy?","American Cancer Society: Prostate Cancer

355,Prostatitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/prostatitis/,"The prostate is a gland that is part of the male reproductive system. It’s about the size of a walnut and helps in sperm production and ejaculation. The prostate lies below a man’s bladder and in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine.

Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland. This occurs when the gland’s tissue becomes swollen and irritated. This can hurt. There are 2 main types: bacterial prostatitis (chronic or acute) or nonbacterial prostatitis.","You can have a range of prostatitis symptoms. They may be similar to other problems with your prostate or urinary tract. If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor:

• Difficult or painful urination
• Frequent urination
• Fever
• Lower back pain
• Pain in your penis, testicles, or perineum (the area between your testicles and rectum)
• Blood in your urine or semen
• Failure to get an erection
• Tenderness in your lower stomach","An infection causes bacterial prostatitis. It is chronic if it starts slowly and lasts for several months. It is acute if it begins and goes away quickly. Infection can occur from:

• A biopsy or surgery
• A sexually transmitted infection (STI)
• Urine blockage
• An injury to your genitals

Nonbacterial prostatitis is more common, but its cause is unknown. This type usually is chronic. It may be related to a previous urinary tract infection (UTI) or chemicals in your urine. Pelvic nerve damage also is a possible cause.","Your doctor will ask about your family’s medical history. They will also do physical and rectal exams. For the physical test, the doctor looks for a swollen, tender scrotum and enlarged lymph nodes in your groin area. For the rectal test, your doctor will insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. They feel the back of your prostate gland for swelling, warmth, and tenderness. Your doctor also may test your urine, blood, or semen samples. This helps rule out other problems.","You can’t prevent most cases of prostatitis. However, you should get checked for STIs. To best protect yourself, use a condom during all sexual encounters. This helps prevent getting or spreading the infection.

Men who have frequent UTIs are more likely to have prostatitis. Men who are 50 years of age or older and have an enlarged prostate also have an increased risk.","It’s common for your doctor to prescribe medicine to get rid of the infection, even for nonbacterial cases. This medicine helps get rid of infection. You may have to take the medicine for several weeks or a few months. For severe cases, you may need to go to a hospital. There you can get fluids to rehydrate or a catheter to help you urinate.

You can treat symptoms of prostatitis by doing these things:

• Drinking extra fluids to urinate more often. This helps get rid of the bacteria faster.
• Avoid food and drinks that dehydrate you. This includes caffeine, alcohol, and anything spicy or acidic.
• Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen. These can reduce pain and swelling.
• Take warm baths to relieve pain in your lower back and other areas.","Treatment should get rid of prostatitis. Take your medicine according to your doctor’s instructions. Finish the prescription and don’t skip any doses. Your doctor likely will recommend follow-up tests. These will confirm if the infection is gone and help prevent it from reoccurring. If it does come back, you’ll need to take more medicine for a longer time.

It is rare for people who have prostatitis to need surgery. Talk to your doctor if your condition is chronic and medicine isn’t helping.

Although prostatitis is painful, it does not cause cancer. However, it can cause your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level to increase. This is a problem if your doctor does a PSA blood test to check for prostate cancer. A positive result does not mean you have cancer. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) does not recommend routine prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer. For men aged 55 through 69 who are considering periodic prostate cancer screening, clinicians should discuss the risks and benefits and engage in shared decision making that enables an informed choice.","• Could my symptoms be caused by something other than prostatitis?
• How do I know if an STI caused my prostatitis?
• How long do I need to take medicine?
• Are there any side effects from treatment?
• Should I avoid having sex while I have prostatitis?
• Is there anything I can do to avoid getting prostatitis again?","National Institutes of Health, Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Prostatitis

356,Pruritus (Itchy Skin),https://familydoctor.org/condition/pruritus/,"Pruritus is the medical term for itchy skin. Normally, itchy skin isn’t serious, but it can make you uncomfortable. Sometimes, itchy skin is caused by a serious medical condition. However, most itchy skin can be treated at home with lotions, moisturizers, and over-the-counter medicines.","Beyond an itching sensation, symptoms can include:

• Redness
• Bumps, spots or blisters
• Dry, cracked skin
• Leathery or scaly skin

Dry, irritated skin is more likely to get infected. Infected skin is red, warm and swollen. It may ooze fluid. You may need antibiotics to get rid of this kind of infection. Severe itching or pain, especially in older adults, sometimes is caused by a serious medical problem. Call your doctor if you are an older person who has severe itching or pain that doesn’t have an obvious cause and doesn’t get better within 2 weeks.","It can be caused by many things, including:

• Dry skin
• Skin disease
• Pregnancy
• Certain medicines
• Allergies
• Diabetes
• HIV/AIDS
• Aging
• Cancer (this is rare)
• Gallbladder disease
• Liver disease

Many times, itchy skin just happens when your skin is dry. This pattern is very common in the winter and in dry climates.","Your doctor will do a visual exam to look at the area that itches. They also will ask you questions about your health history. If your doctor thinks it might be caused by a more serious problem, you may have to undergo more tests. The tests are related to the condition for which your doctor is testing.","If you know what is causing your itchy skin, you may be able to prevent it. For example, if it is caused by allergies, you will need to take your allergy medicine regularly. You may need to avoid the outdoors or other things that trigger your allergies. If it is due to diabetes, it may indicate you are not controlling your blood sugar levels. This means you will need to follow your doctor’s directions for taking medicine, exercising and eating healthy. If it is caused by pregnancy, it will likely clear up once the baby is born.","If your doctor determines the cause of the itch, they will treat the underlying condition. This should relieve the itching. Other treatments include:

• Using a moisturizer. Choose one that is hypoallergenic (it should say so on the label). This means that this type of moisturizer is less likely to cause an allergic reaction on your skin. The best moisturizers are also the most “greasy.” Ointments (or oils) are best, followed by creams, and then lotions. Apply your moisturizer 3 or 4 times during the day. Put it on right after you wash or bathe. This will hold in the moisture from the water. If you have very dry hands, put petroleum jelly (one brand name: Vaseline) on them before you go to bed at night and sleep with your hands in cotton-lined gloves.
• Changing your bathing habits. If you bathe too often, it may dry out your skin. Try to take short, lukewarm baths or showers. Oatmeal baths (one brand name: Aveeno) may be soothing to dry skin. Use a mild soap every day to clean your genital area and under your arms. Use soap on other parts of your body 2 or 3 times a week only. Some people use bath oils to help make their skin less dry. However, these oils can make your tub slippery. To avoid slipping and falling, put the oil on your skin after you get out of the bathtub.
• Applying a cold compress. You can purchase a cold compress at the store or make your own.
• Using over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream or antihistamines.
• Avoiding scratching, wearing irritating fabrics and exposure to high heat and humidity.",Knowing what triggers your itchy skin and having an effective treatment can improve your quality of life. This allows you to prepare for situations when discomfort is at its worse.,"• Why is my skin so dry?
• Should I use a humidifier in my house?
• Will my skin be less dry and itchy during the summer?
• What moisturizer would you recommend?
• Should I use a prescription lotion?
• If my skin starts to crack and bleed, what should I do?
• Should I change my soap?
• Should I change the detergent I use?
• Should I wear gloves when I work in the water?
• Is there something I can use to stop my skin from itching?","National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute: Pruritus – Patient Version

357,Pseudogout,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pseudogout/,"Pseudogout is a type of arthritis that causes painful swelling in one or more of your joints. It can lead to joint damage if left untreated.

Pseudogout is similar to a condition called gout. However, gout typically affects the joint in the big toe. Pseudogout usually affects larger joints, such as your knees. Also, pseudogout is caused by the buildup of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in your joints, while gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid.","Pseudogout causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and warmth in large joints. It most commonly affects the knees, but it can also affect the elbows, ankles, wrists, shoulders, or hands. Pseudogout attacks can be sudden, and the symptoms may last for days or weeks. Some people who have pseudogout don’t have any symptoms between attacks. In other cases, pseudogout can cause constant pain and discomfort. This chronic (long-lasting) pseudogout may seem similar to osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.",Pseudogout develops when deposits of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals build up in the cartilage (tissue that protects your bones) of a joint. The cause of this buildup is often unknown. The crystals are then released into the fluid in your joint. This causes joint pain and swelling.,"Your doctor may draw fluid from your joint to check for the crystals that cause pseudogout. X-rays might also show some buildup of crystals or signs of joint damage. Your doctor will probably want to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as gout, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis.","Treatment can relieve the symptoms of pseudogout and slow or prevent damage to your joints. Unfortunately, no treatment can get rid of the crystal deposits that cause pseudogout. Taking low doses of colchicine may help to reduce your risk of future attacks. Your doctor can talk to you about the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.

If another condition, such as a thyroid problem, caused your pseudogout, treating that condition may help to make the symptoms of pseudogout less severe. It may also make flare-ups less frequent.","Your doctor may suggest using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (called an NSAID) to treat pain and swelling. These include ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). For severe attacks, your doctor may prescribe a prescription-strength NSAID such as indomethacin. If you can’t take NSAIDs, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called colchicine to reduce pain and swelling.

If you have kidney problems or a history of stomach ulcers, you should not take anti-inflammatory medicines. You also should not take them if you are taking blood thinners. In these cases, the doctor may inject the affected joint with a shot of cortisone. Cortisone is a type of steroid that reduces pain and swelling.

Your doctor may drain fluid from your joint to relieve your symptoms. This method is called joint aspiration. It is often used along with cortisone shots.

Your doctor may recommend that you limit physical activity while you are having symptoms of a pseudogout attack.

If your joints become badly damaged by pseudogout, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace them.","There is no cure for pseudogout. You should be able to manage your symptoms, though. Talk to your doctor to see what treatment options are best for you. A good management program can offer you relief from the pain. It also may improve joint function.","• What treatment is best for me?
• When can I expect my symptoms to improve?
• Am I at risk for long-term joint damage?
• Am I at risk for other types of arthritis?
• What lifestyle changes can I make at home to relieve my pain and slow joint damage?

358,Psoriasis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/psoriasis/,Psoriasis is a common chronic skin condition. There are several types of psoriasis. The main type is plaque psoriasis. It occurs when skin cell overgrowth forms a type of rash on your skin. The rash often is raised with red marks and flaky white patches that look like scales.,"The symptoms of psoriasis may include:

• Red or pink raised patches of rough, scaly skin
• Dry or flaky skin that may crack and bleed
• Skin that burns or stings
• Skin that is itchy or sore
• Thick, bumpy fingernails
• Pus-filled blisters on the red patches of skin (in more severe cases)

Symptoms can occur anywhere on your body. Common places are your knees, elbows, and scalp.","Psoriasis starts with the immune system. Your immune system protects your body against infection and disease. When you have psoriasis, your T cells (a kind of white blood cells) wrongly attack your skin cells. This causes your skin cells to rapidly produce and swell.

Most people who get psoriasis are between the ages of 15 and 35. Psoriasis can be genetic, and it is not contagious. You cannot get it from another person or give it to someone else by touching them. You also cannot spread it to other parts of your body.","It may be hard to diagnose psoriasis. This is because it looks like other skin problems, such as eczema. Talk to your doctor if you think you have psoriasis. The doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They may take a biopsy of skin and look at it in the lab to help with your diagnosis. They may refer you to a dermatologist (skin doctor).

There are different degrees of psoriasis:

• Mild: symptoms cover less than 3% of your body.
• Moderate: symptoms cover 3% to 10% of your body.
• Severe: symptoms cover more than 10% of your body.","You cannot avoid psoriasis, but you can help control it. People who have this condition may experience periods of time without any symptoms. Other times, psoriasis can flare up or get worse. Avoid factors that can cause flareups, including:

• Stress
• Dry skin
• Skin irritations
• Cold weather
• Smoking
• Infections (such as strep throat or the common cold)
• Diseases that weaken the immune system
• Certain medicines (such as beta-blockers for high blood pressure)","There are several treatments for psoriasis. Your doctor will help you decide which one is best for you. Try an over-the-counter product first to moisturize your skin. Body lotion and moisturizing creams can help keep your skin from getting too dry and cracking. It can remove some of the scales or rough patches. Bathing in Epsom salts, Dead Sea salts, bath oil, or oatmeal can relieve symptoms as well. It can help reduce redness and itching and remove scales.

If over-the-counter solutions don’t work, your doctor can prescribe topical medicines. These include prescription creams, ointments, lotions, and gels. You apply these to your affected areas. Cover the treated patches with plastic wrap to help the medicine stay on your skin. You can use special shampoos for psoriasis on the scalp.

Your doctor may prescribe medicine in pill or injection form. This is more common in severe cases or when the condition is widespread. Some of these medicines can cause side effects. Often, you take these for a short period of time, like when symptoms flare.

Sunlight can help psoriasis but be careful not to stay in the sun too long. A sunburn can make your condition worse. Talk to your doctor about how to safely use sunlight exposure as a form of treatment. Light therapy can be another option if symptoms are confined to certain areas of your body. With this treatment, the affected skin is exposed to controlled forms of artificial sunlight. Your doctor may also have you take Psoralen, which makes your skin more receptive to light. This is known as PUVA treatment.","There is no cure for psoriasis. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and reduce flares. People who have psoriasis may develop psoriatic arthritis. This affects your joints and causes swelling, stiffness, and pain. Psoriasis can be linked to other health conditions. Examples include diabetes and heart disease.","• How long does treatment last?
• Will I have to be on medicine for the rest of my life?
• Should I make any changes to my skin care routine?
• Are there any skin products or foods that I should avoid?
• If symptoms get worse, when should I call the doctor?
• If I have psoriasis, will my children get it?
• Is there a support group that you recommend?","This article was contributed by: familydoctor.org editorial staff

359,Pulmonary Hypertension,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pulmonary-hypertension/,"“Pulmonary” means “in the lungs,” and “hypertension” means “high blood pressure.” Pulmonary hypertension is an increase in pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs. It is a serious health problem.

Pulmonary arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your lungs. These arteries can narrow or become blocked or damaged. When this happens, they cannot carry as much blood to your lungs. This causes pressure to build up in the narrowed arteries. This puts strain on your heart because it has to work harder to push the blood through. Over time, this weakens your heart, and you can develop heart failure.","Pulmonary hypertension may not cause any symptoms at first. Often, shortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is the first symptom. As the disease gets worse, symptoms can include the following:

• Increased shortness of breath, with or without activity
• Fatigue (tiredness)
• Chest pain or pressure
• Rapid heartbeat
• Pain in the upper right side of the abdomen
• Decreased appetite
• Dizziness or fainting
• Swelling of the ankles, legs and abdomen
• Bluish tint or shading to your skin or lips

Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension usually limit a person’s ability to exercise and do other activities.","Many things can cause pulmonary hypertension. This can make finding the exact cause difficult. Sometimes the disease is inherited. This means it is passed down from a parent to a child in their genes. Other times the cause isn’t known. This is called idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.

When pulmonary hypertension develops because of another medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension. Breathing problems such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as well as sleep apnea, are common causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension.

• Congestive heart failure
• Birth defects in the heart
• Blood clots in the pulmonary arteries
• HIV infection
• Liver disease/cirrhosis
• Connective tissue diseases such as lupus or scleroderma
• Pulmonary fibrosis (a condition that causes scarring in the lungs)
• Certain medicines or street drugs

Some people have a higher risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. These include people who:

• Have a family history of the condition
• Have certain conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, HIV infection, or blood clots in the pulmonary arteries
• Use street drugs (such as methamphetamines or cocaine) or certain diet medicines
• Live at high altitudes","Signs of pulmonary hypertension can be similar to the signs of many other health problems. This makes it hard to diagnose. Your doctor will probably run tests to estimate the blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries. He or she will also want to find out how well your heart and lungs are working. These tests may include:

• A chest X-ray
• A breathing test called a lung function test
• An echocardiogram (sometimes called an “echo”)

Your doctor may also need to do other tests to find out whether another medical condition is causing your pulmonary hypertension. These could include:

• Blood tests
• A chest CT scan
• A chest MRI

If your doctor determines that you have pulmonary hypertension, he or she will want to see how severe it is. For this, they may order an exercise test. These tests measure your activity level and how well your lungs and heart work while you are exercising. These tests can also be done during treatment to see how well the treatment is working.","Not all pulmonary hypertension can be prevented. But you can try to prevent other conditions that can cause the disease. These include high blood pressure, heart disease, liver disease, and chronic lung disease from tobacco use.","There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatment can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. The kind of treatment you receive could depend on what is causing the condition. If the cause is known, treating the cause may improve your condition. For example, if your condition is caused by a lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy to raise the level of oxygen in your blood. Or if it is caused by blood clots in your lungs, you will likely take blood-thinning medicines to prevent clots from getting larger.

There are several treatments that are often used to treat pulmonary hypertension no matter what the cause. These include:

• Diuretics (water pills). These reduce fluid build-up in your body.
• Blood-thinners. These help prevent blood clots from forming or getting bigger.
• Oxygen therapy. This raises the level of oxygen in your blood.
• This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood.
• Other medicines. Medicine that relaxes the blood vessels allows more blood to flow.

Lifestyle changes can also help you feel better. If you smoke, stop. Maintain a healthy weight, eat a nutritious diet, and reduce the amount of stress in your life. If you are a loud snorer or have other signs of sleep apnea, ask your doctor about a sleep study to diagnose this condition. Ask your doctor to recommend ways that you can stay as active as possible. Regular activity can help improve your ability to be active.

In some severe cases, people who have pulmonary hypertension need surgical treatment. This could include a lung transplant or a heart and lung transplant.

Your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.","Because there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension, you will need to learn to manage your condition. The best way to do this is by following the treatment plan developed between you and your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms change or get worse. Know what symptoms could require emergency treatment, such as chest pain.

Making lifestyle changes can also help your condition. This could include:

• Quitting smoking. Smoking makes symptoms of pulmonary hypertension worse.
• Following a healthy diet. Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein. Talk to your doctor to see if you need to limit the amount of salt in your diet. Also ask if you should limit the amount of vitamin K in your diet. Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables and some oils. It can affect how well blood-thinning medicines work.
• Being physically active. Try to be as active as you can. Incorporate regular activity, such as walking, into your daily routine. Ask your doctor if there are any activities you should avoid. These could include lifting heavy objects, sitting in a hot tub, or traveling to high-altitude areas.
• Getting support for emotional issues. Living with pulmonary hypertension can cause you to have anxiety, stress, or depression. Talk about your feelings with your doctor. He or she will be able to direct you to the kind of help you need. This could include talking to a counselor, medicine for depression, or a patient support group.

Which changes you should make may depend on the cause of your condition. Talk to your doctor about what types of changes are best for you.","• How do you know what’s causing my pulmonary hypertension?
• Is the underlying condition treatable?
• What kind of tests will I need? Are they covered by insurance?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? What kinds of exercise can I do?
• I have other health problems. Will treatment of pulmonary hypertension affect the treatment of my other health problems?
• Will I need surgery? What does surgery entail?
• Do I need oxygen for my pulmonary hypertension?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Pulmonary Hypertension

360,Pyloric Stenosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/pyloric-stenosis/,Pyloric stenosis is a medical condition. It is a narrowing of the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That space is called the pylorus. It often occurs in babies younger than 6 months. It is more common in boys than girls.,"Vomiting is the primary symptom. It usually starts around 3 weeks of age. Projective vomiting is common. The vomiting occurs after each feeding or some feedings. The baby is still hungry after vomiting. Other symptoms can include:

• Stomach pain.
• Burping.
• Constant hunger.
• Constipation.
• Poor weight gain, weight loss.
• Wave-like motion of the stomach after feeding or right before vomiting starts.","The condition is caused by a thickening of muscles around the pylorus. This prevents the stomach from passing on its contents to the small intestine.

An exact reason some babies have pylorus stenosis is unclear. It could be hereditary. Parents who had the condition can pass it on. Rick factor can increase a baby’s chance of having it. These include certain antibiotics, too much acid in the top part of the small intestine, and certain diseases, such as diabetes.","If your baby is vomiting a lot, see his or her doctor. Your doctor may diagnose it with a physical exam, imaging test, and blood test. Physical signs include dehydration (dry skin and mouth, few tears when crying, and dry diapers). Other physical signs include a swollen stomach. Your doctor may order a barium X-ray to look into your baby’s stomach. This is an X-ray with dye. It highlights certain parts of the stomach and intestine. The X-ray may show an olive-shaped mass in the upper stomach. A blood test can detect dehydration.",Pyloric stenosis cannot be prevented or avoided.,"Treatment requires surgery. The surgery is designed to widen the pylorus. It is called pyloromyotomy. In most cases, surgeon will give the baby anesthesia to sleep during the surgery. If that is not possible, your doctor may use an endoscope for the procedure. This is a tiny device with a balloon at the end. It is inserted down your baby’s throat. The balloon is widened to expand the pylorus. In some cases, the condition is treated with a feeding tube or medicine that relaxes the pylorus.",The condition is generally caught early. So there are no long-term problems to live with. The exception would be the use of a feeding tube. Your doctor can tell you how long your baby may need the tube.,"• How do I tell the difference between pyloric stenosis, acid reflux and flu symptoms?
• Is my baby in pain when he or she is not vomiting?
• What is the prognosis after surgery?","U.S. National Library of Medicine: Pyloric stenosis – infant

361,Raynaud's Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/raynauds-disease/,"Raynaud’s disease is a rare condition. It is a temporary narrowing of your blood vessels caused by spasm. The condition affects the blood to your skin, mainly to your fingers and toes. It is sometimes called Raynaud’s phenomenon or syndrome.","The reduced blood flow causes your skin to turn white or blue. Affected areas may feel cold, numb, or painful. In rare cases, Raynaud’s may affect your nose, ears, nipples, or lips.

Raynaud’s episodes can last several minutes or hours. They can be frequent or spread out.

Certain events or environments may trigger them. The disease may affect one finger or toe or may spread to others. Once it’s over, your skin turns red as the blood rushes back. It may tingle or throb as it warms up again. It can take up to 15 minutes for blood flow to return to normal.

Some people who have Raynaud’s may develop skin sores or infections. These occur over long periods of time or repeat episodes. Few people have long-term tissue damage from the disease.","There are two types of Raynaud’s disease.

Primary Raynaud’s disease is more common. It represents about 80% of cases. The cause of this type is unknown. It can occur when the blood vessels in your hands or feet overreact to stress and/or cold temperatures. Symptoms are mild with this type. You can treat these with lifestyle changes.

Secondary Raynaud’s disease is more serious. It may require both medicine and lifestyle changes. Other health issues can cause this type, including:

• Connective tissue disorders, such as polymyositis/dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Sjögren’s syndrome, or lupus
• Glandular disorders, such as hypothyroidism
• Blood disorders, such as cold agglutinin disease or polycythemia vera
• Neoplastic (cell growth) disorders, such as carcinoid syndrome or paraneoplastic syndrome
• Problems that affect the nervous system, such as carpal tunnel syndrome
• Vascular disorders, such as thoracic outlet syndrome
• Artery diseases, such as atherosclerosis(hardening of the arteries), Buerger’s disease, or pulmonary hypertension

Some medicines may also trigger secondary Raynaud’s. These include:

• Certain beta blockers used to treat high blood pressure
• Migraine medicines that contain ergotamine
• Medicines that contain estrogen, such as birth control pills
• Chemotherapy medicine, such as cisplatin or vinblastine
• Certain cold medicines that cause blood vessels to narrow, such as those containing pseudoephedrine

Raynaud’s disease affects about 3% to 5% of people. Primary Raynaud’s usually occurs between 15 and 25 years of age. It is more common in women and people who live in colder climates. People who have a family history of the disease are at a greater risk. Secondary Raynaud’s usually occurs later in life, in people 30 years of age and older.",Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. Tell your doctor if episodes occur more when you are cold and/or stressed. Your doctor may trigger an episode using cold water or air to see your response. He or she also will ask if Raynaud’s or related health issues run in your family. Your doctor may check the blood vessels in your fingernails. Blood tests can help identify the type of the disease or other issues that cause your symptoms.,"You cannot avoid Raynaud’s disease. If you have a related health issue, talk to your doctor to see if you have Raynaud’s as well. Other factors that may affect your risk of Reynaud’s include:

• Family history
• Certain medicines (see list above)
• Injuries to your hands or feet
• Living in a colder climate
• Frostbite
• Chemical exposure
• Occupations that involve repetitive motion or vibration (This can damage certain nerves that control blood flow in your body.)","Talk to your doctor about treatment options. They vary based on your type of Raynaud’s and overall health. Certain lifestyle changes may reduce episodes and symptoms. Try to:

• Reduce exposure to the cold or extreme temperature changes. Examples are going outdoors in winter or removing items from a freezer.
• Wear extra warm clothing to protect yourself from the cold.
• Quit smoking.
• Limit caffeine and alcohol.
• Exercise to increase blood flow, especially for primary Raynaud’s disease.
• Avoid wearing clothing or jewelry that is too tight.

People who have secondary Raynaud’s, intense symptoms, and/or frequent episodes may need medicine. Types of medicines that can help include:

• Certain calcium channel blockers (These medicines relax your small blood vessels so they can open again. They also help reduce the frequency and length of episodes.)
• Alpha blockers (These help prevent the hormone epinephrine from constricting your blood vessels.)
• Medicines that help blood cells flow through small channels better
• ACE inhibitors
• Intravenous (IV) prostaglandins

For symptoms that can’t be controlled using these methods, talk to your doctor about new medicines that may help. They may be able to inject medicine in the affected area. This can help block the nerves that trigger the blood vessel changes. You may need this treatment more than once.

Severe episodes (complete lack of blood flow) can lead to losing a finger or toe. Surgery can improve blood flow to your fingers and toes or block certain nerves. In rare cases, the doctor may need to remove damaged or destroyed tissue.","There is no cure for Raynaud’s disease. Both types are lifelong conditions. Research is underway to improve diagnosis and treatment. Lifestyle changes and other treatment help to manage your symptoms. If a health issue is causing secondary Raynaud’s, you will need treatment for that condition as well. Below are tips on how best to cope with Raynaud’s episodes.

• Get warm.Move inside or to a warmer place. Warm your hands or feet with warm water or chemical warmers. These are small packets that you can put in your gloves, pockets, or shoes.
• Move around.Wiggle your fingers and toes. Move your arms or legs in wide circles.
• Promote blood flow.Massage your fingers and toes.
• De-stress.Get away from and avoid anxious situations.

Contact your doctor right away if:

• Symptoms occur on only one side of your body
• You get sores or ulcerson your fingers or toes
• You develop gangrene, which is decaying body tissue","• How do I know if I have primary or secondary Raynaud’s disease?
• If I have Raynaud’s, will my children get it?
• Am I at risk of infection in my affected body part(s)?
• Does Raynaud’s disease put me at risk for other health problems?
• How long do I have to take medicine?

362,Reactive Arthritis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/reactive-arthritis/,"Reactive arthritis is a rare condition. It occurs when your immune system reacts to an infection somewhere else in your body. It can make your joints swell and hurt, similar to arthritis. It can also affect your eyes and genitals. Reactive arthritis may be called Reiter’s syndrome or Fiessinger-Leroy’s disease.","The main symptoms of reactive arthritis are swelling, pain, redness, and warmth in one or more joints. It usually happens in your knees, ankles, or feet. The condition also can affect your eyes or genitals. Your eyes may burn or be red and painful. Your vision may be blurry. You may feel pain or burning when you urinate. You also may have discharge from your penis or vagina.

• Fever
• Stomach pain
• Diarrhea
• Pain in your heel or Achilles tendon
• Skin sores
• Ulcers in your mouth, tongue, or genitals","The exact cause of reactive arthritis is unknown. It begins after you have an infection that activates your immune system. Reactive arthritis has been linked to bacterial infections associated with chlamydia, salmonella, shigella, Yersinia, and campylobacter. These bacteria cause certain sexually transmitted infections and gastrointestinal infections. People who have reactive arthritis often have a specific genetic marker called HLA-B27.

Reactive arthritis is more common in people between 20 and 40 years of age. Men are more prone to develop reactive arthritis related to sexually transmitted bacteria. Women are more likely to get it from a gastrointestinal infection. The condition is rare in children but can occur in teenagers.","There isn’t a specific test to check for reactive arthritis. Your doctor will do an exam and review your symptoms. They will ask about any recent infections.

Your doctor may order X-rays to look at your joints. Lab tests, such as a urinalysis, can rule out other possible conditions. Your doctor may test you for an STI. Other tests are possible as well.","You can’t always avoid reactive arthritis. However, there are things you can do to lower your risk. For example, practice safe sex. Get tested and treated for STIs.

You also can reduce your chance of food poisoning by:

• Cooking meat fully
• Washing utensils and surfaces well
• Keeping food cold so it doesn’t spoil","Treatment for reactive arthritis is meant to relieve symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce swelling and pain. If joint swelling continues, your doctor may recommend corticosteroid injections (shots).

If you have an infection, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics. You and your sexual partner should get tested for STIs. If you are diagnosed with an STI, you may need to take medicine or undergo other treatment.","Reactive arthritis often goes away along with your infection. This could take a few weeks or several months. In some cases, symptoms may return. Talk to your doctor about what you can do to manage ongoing symptoms.","• How do I know if my symptoms are caused by reactive arthritis or another condition?
• What has caused my condition?
• Could I have an STI?
• What is the best treatment for me?
• What are the side effects of antibiotics?
• Is there anything I can do at home to relieve my symptoms?

363,Recurrent Pregnancy Loss | Causes and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/recurrent-pregnancy-loss/,"Recurrent pregnancy loss is when you have 2 or more pregnancy losses, or miscarriages. Miscarriage is when your pregnancy ends on its own in the first 20 weeks of gestation. Experts estimate that 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. Having repeated miscarriages is less common. Only about 1% of women experience these.","Each miscarriage you have may be different. One could cause pain and bleeding, while another could have no symptoms. Typical symptoms of a miscarriage include:

• Spotting or bleeding
• Mild-to-severe back pain (worse than menstrual cramps)
• White-pink mucus discharge from the vagina
• Contractions (painful, happening every 5 to 20 minutes)
• Tissue that looks like a clot passing from the vagina
• Sudden decrease in signs of pregnancy","It can be hard to tell what causes a miscarriage. Often it is a random problem involving chromosomes that happens at conception. In most cases, no cause is found.

Some problems and health conditions can cause repeat miscarriages. These include:

• Translocation. This is when one partner has abnormal chromosomes in their eggs or sperm. One piece of a chromosome is transferred to another chromosome. The embryo might get too much or not enough of the proper chromosomes. A miscarriage could occur.
• Congenital uterus problems. There are many problems that can happen with the uterus. One common problem is a called a septate uterus. This is when the uterus is partially divided into 2 chambers. It can cause complications with pregnancy, including miscarriage.
• Growths or adhesions in the uterus. Asherman syndrome causes adhesions and scarring in the uterus. These can lead to miscarriage. Growths in the uterus also may play a role in miscarriage. These could include fibroids or polyps.

Some medical conditions could increase your risk of having multiple miscarriages. These include:

• Problems with your immune system
• Thyroid disease
• Diabetes
• Polycystic ovary syndrome
• Thrombophilia (blood clotting disorder)

Nothing you have done is causing you to have repeat miscarriages. Things like working, exercising, having sex, or morning sickness do not cause miscarriage. Any kind of fall or blow is rarely to blame. The research on the effects of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine is unclear. So, your miscarriages are not the result of anything you did or didn’t do. You should never blame yourself for a miscarriage.","If you have had 3 miscarriages, your doctor will probably want to do some testing. This can help him or her try to find a cause. They will ask about your medical history. They will get details on your past pregnancies. Your doctor will do a physical exam. They may order blood tests. Your doctor might order imaging tests to look at your uterus. They might also order special testing to look for genetic reasons that you’re having miscarriages.","There is no conclusive research that says there is anything you can do to prevent a miscarriage. You didn’t cause it, so you couldn’t have prevented it.","Treatment options depend on what is causing the problem. Some possible treatments include medicines, corrective surgery, or genetic counseling. If no cause is found, not much can be done. More than half of women who don’t know the cause can go on to have a healthy pregnancy.","A pregnancy loss can be emotional even if the pregnancy was unplanned. Everyone grieves a pregnancy loss differently. Some women may have trouble coping with their feelings. If you are very upset or feel like you need help, there are resources available. Talk to your doctor. They may be able to refer you to a local support group. There are also national resources you can access. One is SHARE: Pregnancy and Infant Loss Support. It lists local support groups and offers online resources that could help you.","• What is causing me to have repeat miscarriages?
• How can I find out if it’s a genetic problem with me or my partner?
• What are the chances that I’ll have another miscarriage if I try to get pregnant again?
• What is the best treatment option for me?
• Can you recommend somewhere I can get emotional support?

364,Repeated Infections in Children,https://familydoctor.org/condition/repeated-infections-in-children/,"Babies are born with immature immune systems. As a result, babies tend to get a high number of infections, usually 4 to 8 per year. Babies’ immune systems begin to mature soon after birth. The number of infections begins to go down with time. By the time children are of school-age, their rate of infection is usually the same as the rate for adults.

Infections come in two main types: bacterial and viral. Bacterial infections are caused by bacteria. Viral infections are caused by a virus. The most common bacterial infections in babies are skin, ear, and throat. The most common viral infections in babies are respiratory, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and influenza virus. Serious but infrequent newborn infections can include blood (bacteremia), urinary tract, and brain or spinal fluid infections (bacterial meningitis).

The most common","signs of infection in your baby include:

• Fever
• Persistent crying
• Irritability
• Sleeping more than usual
• Lethargy (inactive)
• Refusing to take a bottle or breastfeed
• Breathing problems
• Vomiting
• Diarrhea

Most children who have repeated infections don’t have any serious problems and grow up to be healthy adults. Make sure your child gets plenty of sleep and eats a healthy diet. Sleep and proper nutrition may be just as important as medicine in helping your child fight off infections.

Sometimes it’s easy to see the cause of repeated infections. In daycare centers, children give infections to each other. They drool and their noses drip. They touch each other and touch all the toys. This spreads infections. Some viruses can live on objects for several hours. As adults we have far less contact with each other’s germs, so we are less likely to catch so many infections.

Exposure to cigarette smoke (sometimes called “passive smoking”) is another cause for runny noses and wheezing in young children. Passive smoking is linked to asthma in children. It is also a risk factor for respiratory infection in children. This makes it important to keep all children away from cigarette or cigar smoke.

Structural changes in the sinuses or the eustachian tubes (connecting tubes in each ear) are a common cause of repeated infections in children. The term “structural changes” refers to differences in the bony parts of the skull, the sinuses, and the ears. These differences may be inherited. Some differences in body structure make it easier for a person to get infections because the normal drainage of the eustachian tube (in the ear) or sinuses (in the nose) is blocked. When the drainage is blocked, the number of bacteria grows. This leads to infection. In most children, as the head grows, drainage problems get better. If young children are having too many ear infections, they might need antibiotics or special ear tubes.

Allergies can also cause repeated sinusitis (stuffy or drippy nose) and wheezing. Allergies can cause inflammation inside the nose that lasts for a long time. Because of the inflammation, the normal drainage pathways of the nose and sinuses swell and get plugged up. Bacteria grow, causing an infection. Medicine is necessary to treat the cause of the infection, which is the allergy.

Persistent coughing and wheezing that occurs with mild viral infections may be a sign of asthma. Sometimes when we think children have pneumonia as a complication of a cold, they really have asthma. These children need asthma medicine in addition to other medicine for infection.

In some cases, the answer is chance alone. In rare cases, an otherwise healthy child will have 2 or 3 severe infections for no obvious reason. However, your doctor may want your child to have some simple screening tests to check for an immune deficiency (a weakness in the immune system). This is the main cause of repeated severe infections.

Most doctors become concerned if children go from simple viral infections to more complicated and severe bacterial infections. Examples are blood infections and pneumonia. Unusual infections or an increase in the number of infections over time are other warning signs.

If you have a family history of allergies and asthma, you may want to have your doctor check your child for these conditions.",null,null,"• Wash your hands and your child’s hands often. Wash after using the bathroom and when preparing food. Also wash after sneezing, blowing your nose, and coughing. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water.
• If you smoke, stop. Until you quit completely, smoke only outside of your home and outside of your car. Smoking in a room away from your child does not help. Air filters also do not help protect your child from secondhand smoke.
• Vaccinate your child against common childhood diseases. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends immunizing all children and adolescents 0-18 years of age unless contraindicated.",• Don’t use ear candles. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises against the use of ear candles. Ear candling involves inserting a special candle in the ear.

365,Restless Leg Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/restless-legs-syndrome/,Restless legs syndrome (also called RLS) is a condition in which your legs feel very uncomfortable when you’re sitting or lying down. It usually happens in the evening or night. It can affect both men and women and occur at any age (including during childhood). It often worsens with age and becomes a problem for older adults. RLS can make sleeping and traveling difficult and uncomfortable.,"People who have RLS often say it’s difficult to describe their symptoms. If you have RLS, you may have a “creepy-crawly” feeling in your legs that makes you want to move around. You may experience achy, tingly, or burning sensations in your legs, which can make it difficult to sleep or sit for long periods of time. Moving your legs makes the feeling go away for a few minutes, but it comes back after you sit or lie still again. Your legs may also twitch when you try and sleep (also called periodic limb movements of sleep or PLMS).","Doctors don’t know what causes RLS. Some cases are related to other conditions, such as pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, or kidney failure. Other cases of RLS have no known cause. RLS may be hereditary, which means it can run in your family.

There are some types of medications that can worsen RLS symptoms. These include antidepressants, antinausea drugs, antipsychotic drugs, and cold and allergy medications that contain antihistamines.","Tell your doctor about the restless sensations. He or she will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as when they start and whether you’re able to do anything to make them go away. He or she may also ask if any other people in your family have similar symptoms. Tell your doctor about any medicines (including over-the-counter medicines) you’re taking. You could be taking a medicine that makes RLS worse. If so, your doctor may be able to recommend another medicine.","RLS can’t be prevented because doctors aren’t sure what causes it. But there are some things you can do to help lessen your symptoms.

Lifestyle changes to treat RLS:

• For mild symptoms, use an over-the-counter pain reliever to reduce twitching and restless sensations.
• Cut back on alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco.
• Try taking a hot bath and massaging your legs before bedtime to help you relax.
• Relaxation techniques, such as meditation and yoga, can help you relax before bed.
• Apply warm or cool packs to your legs, which can help relieve sensations.
• Try to distract your mind by reading or doing a crossword puzzle while you wait for sleep to come.
• Moderate exercise may help, but don’t overdo it. Exercising vigorously or late in the day may make symptoms worse.
• Try to go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. Also try to get a sufficient amount of sleep each night.","Treatment for RLS includes medicines and lifestyle changes. Medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease can help reduce tremors and twitching in the legs. If your iron levels are low, your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement.

In some cases, an anticonvulsant medicine (usually used to stop seizures) can be helpful. Historically, sleep aids, muscle relaxants (called benzodiazepines), and pain medicines (called opioids) have been prescribed by doctors to relieve symptoms. Use of these medicines is becoming more and more limited for RLS because of their known side effects and potential drawbacks. Opioids, if not taken exactly as instructed by your doctor, can be addictive.

For many cases of RLS, a combination of medicines is usually needed to best treat the condition. Your doctor may prescribe several trials of medicine before finding one that works best for your case of RLS.","Keep your doctor posted on how you’re feeling. He or she can suggest different relaxation techniques and can change your medicine if it’s not helping. You may want to join a support group to talk to other people who are suffering from RLS. Also, because RLS tends to run in families, you may want to talk to your relatives about your RLS and see if they have similar symptoms.","• What types of medicines do you recommend to treat my restless legs syndrome (RLS)?
• Could there be another condition causing my RLS?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I could make that might help my RLS?
• Can you recommend an RLS support group?
• I’ve heard smoking may cause RLS. Can you help me quit?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Restless Legs

It is most common in children, but anyone can get it. It is considered a two-phase illness because it typically occurs in children who are recovering from a viral infection. But it can occur three to five days after the start of the virus. Viruses could include a cold, the flu, or chickenpox. Also, it is commonly associated with the use of aspirin in children. You should avoid giving a child aspirin (salicylates) or over-the-counter medicines that contain salicylates to help prevent Reye’s syndrome.","The symptoms of Reye’s syndrome can be very mild and may go unnoticed. But they also can be very serious and worsen within hours, even to the point of death. That is why it’s important for parents to take symptoms of Reye’s syndrome seriously. If your child shows these symptoms, they need medical attention right away.

The most common symptoms include:

• Vomiting that may last for hours
• Personality changes, including irritability and aggressive behavior
• Inability to stay alert or awake
• Diarrhea and rapid breathing in children under 2 years old

• Confusion
• Lethargy
• Weakness in the arms or legs
• Speech difficulties
• Double vision
• Hearing loss
• Seizures
• Loss of consciousness or coma","Doctors aren’t sure exactly what causes Reye’s syndrome. But they have found that using aspirin to treat a viral illness increases the chances that a child will develop the condition. Now that doctors know this, parents should not give their children aspirin when sick. Fortunately, the number of cases of Reye’s syndrome have decreased. The condition is now very rare in the United States.","There is no one test for Reye’s syndrome. Diagnosis usually starts with blood and urine tests. Doctors may also test for metabolic disorders that could affect the liver. Sometimes more invasive tests are needed. This could include a spinal tap (lumbar puncture), liver biopsy, CT scan, or MRI. These tests can help the doctor rule out other conditions that could be causing the symptoms.","The best way to avoid this illness is to avoid giving children aspirin, especially to treat symptoms of a viral illness. Unless instructed to do so by your child’s doctor, don’t give aspirin to any child under the age of 19. Always check the label before giving your child an over-the-counter medicine. Aspirin can be hidden in many medicines, such as Pepto-Bismol and Alka-Seltzer. Other names for aspirin include:

• Acetylsalicylic acid
• Acetylsalicylate
• Salicylic acid
• Salicylate

If your child has chickenpox, the flu, or another viral illness, you can treat fever and pain with other medicines. These include acetaminophen (1 brand name: Tylenol), ibuprofen (1 brand name: Advil), or naproxen (1 brand name: Aleve).

Another way to help prevent Reye’s syndrome is to prevent viral illnesses that can cause it. Make sure your child’s vaccinations are current. This includes 2 doses of the chickenpox vaccine and a yearly flu vaccine.","There is no cure for Reye’s syndrome. Successful treatment depends on early diagnosis. Treatment usually happens in the hospital. If it is a severe case, your child may be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Treatments may include:

• IV fluids. Your child may be hooked up to an intravenous (IV) line to give them fluids and keep them hydrated.
• These medicines can be used to reduce the amount of pressure in the brain.
• These could be used to reduce swelling in the brain.
• Medicines to prevent bleeding. Abnormalities in the liver can cause bleeding, so medicines will be used to stop the bleeding.
• If your child is having trouble breathing, they may need assistance from a breathing machine (ventilator).","Reye’s syndrome is a serious illness that can cause major complications. A child’s recovery depends on how severe the swelling of the brain is. If the disease is caught early, swelling may not be significant. The child has a good chance of a full recovery. But if the disease reaches the later stages, a child may suffer brain damage and disability. In some cases, the child may die. That is why it is so important that you get medical help right away if you notice the symptoms of Reye’s syndrome in your child. Early detection and treatment can mean the difference between a full recovery and brain damage or death.","• What caused Reye’s syndrome in my child?
• What kinds of tests will my child need to have?
• How is this disease treated?
• How long will it take for my child to recover?
• Will my child have brain damage or disability?
• What kind of follow-up care will my child need?
• Which over-the-counter medicines have aspirin in them?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Reye Syndrome

367,Rheumatic Fever,https://familydoctor.org/condition/rheumatic-fever/,Rheumatic fever is a rare inflammatory disease. It mostly happens in areas that don’t have access to health care. It usually doesn’t happen in the United States. Children ages 5 to 15 are at greatest risk.,"Rheumatic fever affects your heart, brain, joints, and skin. Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, stomach pain, and nosebleeds. You may have shortness of breath or chest pain. Other symptoms include:

• Joint pain and swelling
• Skin rash that could be red or hot
• Small bumps under your skin
• Sydenham chorea (a rare neurological condition marked by spasms and frantic emotions)","Rheumatic fever happens after you have a Group A streptococcus bacterial infection. These infections include strep throat and scarlet fever. If you’re not treated for these infections, the bacteria can eventually make your immune system attack your body’s healthy tissue. Rheumatic fever begins 14 to 28 days after the initial infection.","First, your doctor will ask about your symptoms. They will do a physical exam. This includes looking at your joints and skin, and listening to your heart. Next, they can perform several tests. A blood test or throat culture can detect a strep infection. An electrocardiogram (EKG) uses electrical signals to check your heart rate and rhythm. A sedimentation rate or a C-reactive protein (CRP) checks for inflammation.

Your doctor will group your symptoms and test results into two categories. In order to diagnose rheumatic fever, you must have strep throat and either 2 major symptoms or 1 major symptom and 2 minor ones.",Visit your doctor if you have signs of strep throat. This can prevent the infection from turning into rheumatic fever.,"The main treatment for rheumatic fever is antibiotics. These will get rid of the bacteria and can help keep you from getting the condition again. Adults and teenagers may need to take antibiotics for up to 5 years. Children may need to take them up to age 21.

Your doctor may prescribe other medicines to treat your symptoms. Seizure medicine can help with the jerky motions or spasms. Aspirin or corticosteroids can help reduce swelling or inflammation.","Although strep throat is contagious, rheumatic fever is not. When treated, you can recover, but you may have short- or long-term damage to your heart. This can include rheumatic heart disease. Because of the long-term effects, you’ll need to have an ongoing treatment plan with your doctor.","• Does the risk of rheumatic fever go away if I’m treated when I have strep throat or scarlet fever?
• What is my risk of getting rheumatic fever if I’ve had strep throat in the past?
• Can I get rheumatic fever more than once?
• Why do I have to take antibiotics for so many years?

368,Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/rheumatoid-arthritis/,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic (lasting) inflammatory disorder. It causes swelling and pain in the lining of your joints. It can affect other parts of your body, such as the lining of your heart and lungs.","Rheumatoid arthritis often occurs in your hands, wrists, feet, and knees first. It can affect several joints at the same time, on both sides of your body. For example, both of your wrists may be painful and stiff. The joints of the fingers and toes can be some of the first places that have pain and stiffness. Over time, RA may affect other joints, such as your jaw, shoulders, and hips.

Symptoms of RA may include one or more of the following:

• Painful and swollen joints, especially in your hands, feet, and knees
• Difficulty moving your joints
• Stiffness and pain in joints, especially after sleeping
• Fever
• Fatigue
• Red, puffy hands
• Hard bumps (called rheumatoid nodules) just under the skin near the joints
• Loss of appetite",Rheumatoid arthritis is a form of arthritis and a type of autoimmune disease. It occurs when the body’s immune system attacks its own joint tissue. The exact cause of this is unknown.,"Your doctor will review your symptoms and do a physical exam. They also may order blood tests, X-rays, or a joint fluid analysis, which tests the fluid in your joints for other possible causes of pain.","You can’t prevent or avoid rheumatoid arthritis since its cause is unknown. However, you may increase your chances of developing RA if you:

• Are older
• Are a woman
• Are a smoker
• Are overweight
• Have a family history of RA

There are lifestyle changes you can make to help manage RA.

• Lose weight if you’re overweight.
• Eat a healthy diet.
• Stop smoking.
• Do regular, gentle exercise. This can strengthen the muscles around your joints and lessen fatigue. Mild water aerobics and walking are good exercises to try. If you feel pain in a new joint while exercising, stop and rest. Talk to your doctor if the pain persists.
• Use heat and cold. Heat relaxes tense muscles and cold numbs pain. One way to apply heat is to take a 15-minute hot shower or bath. Cold treatments include ice packs or soaking your joints in cold water. Don’t use these methods if you have poor circulation.
• Reduce the stress on your affected joints. For instance, canes can help you walk. Consider using grabbing tools to help you pick up items. Ask your doctor about other ways to make your daily life easier.","Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis aims to relieve symptoms, reduce pain, prevent future damage, and improve quality of life. Talk to your doctor about treatment options. They can help you decide which is best for you. Options include medicine, surgery, and lifestyle changes.

For severe cases of RA or cases not effectively treated with medicine, surgery may be an option. Procedures may include correcting a deformity or replacing a joint. Knee and hip replacements are most common. The effects of surgery can help to ease pain and regain joint movement. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of surgery.","Rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong disease. When it’s treated, it may go away for a little while, but it usually comes back. It’s important to see your doctor as soon as symptoms begin. The earlier you start treatment, the better your outcome. Some of the damage from RA is irreversible, so finding the disease and treating it early is important.

If left untreated, RA can cause other health problems. Your hands may become bent or twisted. Other joints can become deformed. Inflammation will affect your cartilage and bones. Lung and heart problems also can occur. Talk to your doctor if you notice any new symptoms or problems.","• How do I know if my joint pain is caused by rheumatoid arthritis?
• Does RA run in families?
• What medicines would work best for me, and what are the side effects?
• Is there anything I can do to prevent flare-ups of RA?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","For mild cases of RA, your doctor may suggest taking over-the-counter (OTC) medicines to reduce inflammation. These include aspirin (one brand name: Bayer), ibuprofen (one brand name: Advil), or naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). Medicines such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) can help relieve pain and make you feel better. Your doctor will also prescribe medicines to help treat RA. Prescription pain relievers and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and swelling. These medicines do have some side effects and should be taken wisely.

Medicines that manage your immune system (called immunosuppressants) also can be used to fight RA. When you have RA, your immune system is out of control. These drugs bring it back to normal. However, they can affect your immune system’s ability to respond to infections.

Your doctor also may prescribe a steroid, such as prednisone. Steroids can reduce pain and swelling, while slowing the damage to your joints. However, they can only be used for a brief time. The longer you use steroids (several months or years), the less effective they become. Steroids do have side effects, such as easy bruising, bone thinning, cataracts, and diabetes.

Anti-rheumatic medicines can help treat RA. If you start taking these drugs early enough, they can slow the damage to your joints. These medicines work slowly, and it may take a few weeks to start feeling better. Your doctor may do a blood test to make sure these medicines are safe for you. Some of these medicines should not be taken if you’re pregnant."
369,Rickets,https://familydoctor.org/condition/rickets/,"Rickets is a rare disorder that affects the bones, causing them to soften and break easily. It is most common in children.

Rickets has several main","symptoms, including:

• delayed growth
• muscle weakness
• pain in the bones of the spine,pelvis, and legs
• bowed (curved) or misshapen legs.

Rickets also can cause dental issues, such as cavities and problems with teeth structure.","A lack of vitamin D causes most cases of rickets. Vitamin D helps bones absorb calcium and phosphorus. If your child does not get enough vitamin D, their body may not get the nutrients it needs to make bones strong.

Rickets is most common in children ages 6 to 24 months. This is because their bones grow rapidly during this period. Your child also may be at risk if they:

• Have dark skin.
• Don’t get enough exposure to sunlight.
• Don’t eat enough foods containing vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus.
• Breastfeed without getting a vitamin D supplement.
• Have an illness that prevents their body from making or absorbing vitamin D. One example is celiac disease.

This condition also can run in families, and children can inherit it.",Your doctor will ask about your family health history and your child’s health and diet. Your child will need a full physical exam. Blood tests and bone X-rays also help the doctor determine if your child has rickets.,"In most cases, you can help prevent your child from having rickets. Make sure they get enough vitamin D and calcium. If your baby is breastfed or consumes more breast milk than formula, they need a vitamin D supplement. This is because breast milk does not contain enough vitamin D alone. Do not give your child vitamin supplements unless your doctor recommends them. Ask your doctor for dosage information.

If your child eats solid foods, you should manage their diet. Offer them foods high in vitamin D, such as breakfast cereals and orange juice, and calcium, such as milk, cheese, and salad greens.

Ask your doctor how much time in the sun is safe for your child. Remember that infants and babies require protection from direct sunlight.","Treatment depends on the type of rickets your child has. For children who lack enough nutrients, the doctor will prescribe supplements for vitamin D and calcium. Your child’s pain and muscle weakness should get better within a few weeks. If your child has bone defects caused by rickets, they may need braces or surgery to correct the problem.

For children who inherit rickets or have an illness that caused it, you may need to see a specialist.","Most cases of rickets go away once your child gets enough vitamin D. There may be lasting effects or defects that require further treatment, such as braces or surgery. Your child may need therapy as a result. It is possible that your child may require a strict diet in order to stay healthy.","• What is the likely cause of my child’s rickets?

370,Ringworm - Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ringworm/,"Ringworm (tinea) is a fungal skin infection that appears as a rash in the shape of a ring, but there is no worm involved. Anyone can get ringworm, but it is most common in children. If you have ringworm, it usually appears in multiple areas of your body. If it’s restricted to certain areas of your body, it may be called something else. For example, ringworm on your feet is known as athlete’s foot (tinea pedis). If it appears on your inner thighs, groin, or buttocks, it is known as jock itch (tinea cruris). Ringworm of the scalp is called tinea capitis. Ringworm of the beard is called tinea barbae.","Ringworm can affect one or more parts of your skin. It can even occur on your fingernails and toenails. Symptoms may vary based on the infection’s location. Common symptoms for general ringworm include:

• Red rash shaped like a ring
• Clear skin within the ring
• Itching
• Red, dry, or flaking skin
• Swollen, raised, or blistered skin
• Loss of hair at the site of the rash

Ringworm of the feet (tinea pedis or “athlete’s foot”) symptoms include:

• Red, swollen, peeling, itchy skin between the toes (especially between the pinky toe and the one next to it)
• Rash and blister on the sole and heel of the foot

Ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis) symptoms include:

• Scaly, itchy, red, circular bald spot that can grow in size and multiple spots

Ringworm of the groin (tinea cruris or “jock itch”) symptoms include:

• Scaly, itchy, red spots, usually on the inner sides of the skin folds of the thigh

Ringworm of the beard (tinea barbae) symptoms include:

• Scaly, itchy, red spots on the cheeks, chin, and upper neck. The spots might become crusted over or filled with pus, and the affected hair might fall out.","Fungus is the cause of ringworm. There are about 40 different types of fungi that can produce it. They can live on skin or other surfaces. They like warm, damp areas. You can get the infection by touching other people who have it or sharing items like combs, unwashed clothing and from touching shower and pool surfaces. Also, pets such as cats and dogs can carry and spread the fungus.",See your doctor if you have symptoms of ringworm. They will look at your skin and ask you questions about your symptoms. They may scrape off a small piece of skin to check for fungus.,"There are certain things that can increase your risk of getting ringworm. However, you can help prevent ringworm by doing the following:

• Keep your skin as clean and dry as possible, including washing your hands with soap and water after coming in contact with an animal.
• Keep your fingernails and toenails short and clean.
• Do not go barefoot in public areas, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers.
• Wear shoes that provide airflow.
• Wash your clothes regularly; don’t wear the same underwear or socks for more than one day.
• Shower right after playing a contact sport or swimming in a public pool.
• Clean household surfaces with antibacterial cleaners.
• Avoid touching people or pets that have ringworm. Also avoid touching the things they touch.
• Do not share items with people who have ringworm.","There are two main types of ringworm treatment – over-the-counter and prescription medicines. If you have ringworm on your skin, you can use an over-the-counter medicine. This includes antifungal cream, lotion or powder. Your doctor will want you to apply it for 2 to 4 weeks. This may vary based on how bad your symptoms are or if the ringworm has spread. If you have ringworm on your head, you will need to use an antifungal prescription medicine. Your doctor will want you to use it for 1 to 3 months.","If your ringworm infection does not go away with medicine or gets worse, contact your doctor.","• How contagious is ringworm?

371,Rosacea,https://familydoctor.org/condition/rosacea/,Rosacea is a common skin condition that occurs on the face. It causes redness and small bumps that are similar to acne.,"The first sign of rosacea often is redness. It may appear like a blush or sunburn across your nose, cheeks, forehead, or chin. Other symptoms include red or pus-filled bumps and small blood vessels. For some people, the skin of their nose may become red, thick, and swollen. This is caused by excess tissue and called rhinophyma. Rosacea also can affect your eyes, making them red or watery. It may irritate and inflame your eyelids and the white part of your eye. This is called conjunctivitis.","The exact cause of rosacea is unknown. Possible causes include defects in the immune, nervous, or vascular systems. It tends to run in families. People who are fair-skinned and blush easily are more likely to have it. Symptoms often begin in adults between 30 and 60 years of age. Women get rosacea more on the cheeks and chin, while men are more likely to have rhinophyma. The condition tends to be more severe in men.","Contact your doctor if you have signs of rosacea. They may refer you to a dermatologist, who specializes in skin conditions.","Since the cause of rosacea is unknown, you cannot prevent it. However, there are things you can do to avoid flare-ups. These include changes to your lifestyle and environment. Triggers vary by person and may take time to identify. Common triggers include:

• Direct or indirect heat, such as the sun or hot baths
• Weather, such as hot or freezing temperatures and strong winds
• Harsh skin care products
• Exercise or sweating
• Stress or anxiety
• Alcohol
• Certain foods
• Menopause
• Other skin or health conditions","Medicine is the most common form of treatment for rosacea. The type of medicine your doctor recommends will depend on your symptoms. Medicines may include special antibiotics in the form of pills, gel, or cream. These work well at improving pimples and bumps. Skin redness is harder to treat.

It may take 2 months or more for treatment to work. As your symptoms improve, the amount of medicine you take may be cut down or stopped. It is hard to know how long you will need treatment. Each person’s skin is different, and your doctor may want to adjust your treatment.

For severe cases, surgery may be an option. It is most often done to treat rhinophyma. Enlarged blood vessels on your face can sometimes be removed with a fine electric needle or laser surgery.","Rosacea cannot be cured, but treatment can help relieve symptoms and improve skin appearance. Remember to always wear sunscreen. Avoid known triggers to prevent flare-ups. If left untreated, this condition can get worse over time. This can have emotional and social effects. Some people lose self-esteem and don’t like to be seen in public because of the way they look. It is important to work with your doctor to treat symptoms and improve your quality of life.","• How do I know if I have rosacea?

372,Rotavirus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/rotavirus/,"Rotavirus is a common stomach and intestinal illness. It mostly affects babies and young children. It is one of the most common causes of severe diarrhea. Almost all children will have a rotavirus infection by the time they are 5 years old.

Rotavirus is highly contagious. It spreads through direct or indirect contact with an infected person’s feces (poop). It can happen if you touch a contaminated object, food, water, or the hands or mouth of an infected person. The virus enters your body when your unclean hand touches your nose or mouth.

The risk of catching rotavirus is greatest in the winter and spring (December through June). Adults can get the disease, but their","symptoms usually aren’t as severe.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and stomach pain. If your child has rotavirus, they also may be weak and cry more than normal. Dehydration (not getting enough fluids) is a symptom in more severe cases. Dehydration happens because diarrhea and vomiting cause your body to lose fluids.

Symptoms of dehydration include:

• Dry mouth and throat.
• Decreased urination.
• Crying with few or no tears.
• Sunken eyes or sunken soft spot on the top of the head.
• Unusual fussiness, sleepiness, or lethargy.

Once you have been exposed to rotavirus, it takes about 2 days for symptoms to appear. Symptoms can last between 3 and 8 days.","Rotavirus is a part of the Reoviridae family of viruses that commonly cause stomach and respiratory illness. It is spread through people’s stool (poop). If your child gets rotavirus particles in their mouth, it can make them sick. This happens when:

• A child’s hands are contaminated with poop and they put them in their mouth.
• A child touches contaminated objects or surfaces, such as toys, and then puts their fingers in their mouth.
• A child eats contaminated food.

Rotavirus spreads easily between babies and young children. They can then spread it to caregivers or family members who they have close contact with.","Your doctor can usually diagnose rotavirus in your child based on their symptoms and an office exam. If your doctor is uncertain, he or she may ask that you bring in a stool sample from your child. Your doctor will send the sample to a lab for testing.","A rotavirus oral vaccine offers some protection against the disease. There are two different vaccines available. One is usually given to babies at 2 and 4 months old. The other is given at 2, 4, and 6 months old. Your doctor will recommend which vaccine is right for your child. Your child should receive all doses of the vaccine before they are 8 months old.

The vaccine is not 100% effective. Children can still get the disease after getting the vaccine. However, vaccinated children typically have less serious symptoms than children who didn’t get the vaccine.

Beyond the vaccination, simple hand washing is the best prevention. Always wash your hands (and have your child wash their hands) before eating and after using the toilet. Always wash your hands after changing a diaper, whether or not the baby has the virus. If you know someone has rotavirus, wash your hands after touching them or anything they’ve touched. Children who are infected should stay away from other children until their diarrhea has ended.","Because rotavirus is a virus, it cannot be treated with antibiotics. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.

Your doctor will recommend treatment for your child’s symptoms, especially for fever and diarrhea. In severe cases of the illness, where dehydration occurs, your doctor will focus on giving your child more fluids. You may be able to increase your child’s fluids at home by giving them ice chips or popsicles. Avoid giving your child fruit juice or soda, which can make diarrhea worse. Your doctor may recommend special drinks that replace body fluids. If the problem is severe, your child may have to go to the hospital to receive IV fluids (injecting fluids into your child’s veins by inserting a small needle into their arm).","Living with rotavirus will be unpleasant for a short time for your child and you, as the caregiver. Your focus will be on making your child comfortable and keeping your home free from contamination during their illness.","• If my child has rotavirus, how long is he or she contagious?
• What’s the best way to give my child fluids?
• What if I see blood in my child’s stool?
• Is hand-washing with standard soap effective in fighting off the infection?

373,RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus),https://familydoctor.org/condition/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv/,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common virus that affects your lungs and makes it difficult to breathe. The virus is common in children under 2, however, people of all ages can get it. It is more serious for young and premature babies and older adults with poor health. Adults over 60 with heart and lung disease are at a particularly higher risk for getting the virus.

RSV is common in the spring and fall. Unfortunately, you can get the virus more than once in your lifetime.

Certain risk factors make young babies more likely to catch RSV. These include:

• Being underweight
• Congenital heart disease
• Weakened immune system (your body cannot fight infections)
• Lung disease
• Premature birth
• Neuromuscular disease (muscular dystrophy)
• Exposure to tobacco smoke while in the mother’s womb","Respiratory syncytial virus symptoms are different based on age. Older children and healthy adults have mild, cold-like symptoms. This includes a cough, stuffy nose, and low fever. Symptoms appear 4 to 6 days after catching the virus.

Infants (less than 1 year old), premature babies, and adults who are older than 60 with lung and heart disease have more serious symptoms. These can include:

• Runny nose
• Poor appetite
• Coughing
• Fever
• Sneezing
• Irritability (in babies)
• Trouble breathing (shortness of breath, wheezing, rapid breathing)
• Flaring nostrils as you breathe
• Bluish skin (due to lack of oxygen)

More serious infections can lead to:

• Pneumonia
• Bronchiolitis (lung inflammation)","RSV is a virus caused by a common germ found in lung infections. Children under the age of 2 typically get the infection. It is spread through sneezing, coughing, sharing food, cups, eating utensils, touching used tissues, and kissing a person with the virus. Touching your nose and mouth after coming into contact with an infected person can also spread the virus. RSV spreads quickly in crowded areas such as daycare centers, schools, and crowded living conditions (college dorms).","First, your doctor will do a physical exam and use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Your doctor will also ask you about your medical history and your exposure to public areas. Next, your doctor may perform additional tests to detect respiratory syncytial virus, including a rapid lab test (swabbing your nose), a chest X-ray (to check for pneumonia), and a blood test to check for dehydration. Your young baby’s doctor may order additional blood or urine tests for serious infections. Serious cases of the illness may require admission to the hospital.","The FDA approved the RSV vaccine in May 2023. The new vaccines are now available.

• Infants younger than age 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season (typically fall through spring) are recommended to receive one dose of nirsevimab (50 mg for infants who weigh less than 5 kg and 100 mg for infants who weigh 5 kg or greater).
• Children ages 8 to 19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season are recommended to receive one 200-mg dose of nirsevimab.
• Women who are pregnant are recommended to receive a single dose Abrysvo (a vaccine manufactured by Pfizer, Inc.) between 32 and 36 weeks into their pregnancy. This will provide infants a measure of defense in the first few months of life when they are most vulnerable to severe disease.

The CDC recommends an RSV vaccine for all adults ages 75 years and older and for adults ages 60–74 years who are at increased risk of severe RSV. Conditions that increase your risk for severe illness include:

• Chronic heart or lung disease
• Weakened immune system
• Certain other medical conditions, including some people with diabetes and some people with obesity
• Living in a nursing home

Reduce your risk of getting the virus by following these tips:

• Wash your hands with soap, frequently.
• Don’t go to work, school, or public places if you are sick. Stay home instead. RSV spreads quickly in large crowds.
• Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow when you sneeze or cough. Don’t use your hands.
• Don’t share food, drinks, or eating utensils.
• Don’t kiss.
• Don’t share or touch used tissues.
• Don’t shake hands.
• Don’t touch a baby as long as you are sick.
• Wash your eating utensils with hot, soapy water.","RSV cannot be treated with an antibiotic since antibiotics do not work on viruses. A mild case of RSV will go away after 2 weeks if untreated. However, young babies and older people who have a serious case of the virus may be admitted into the hospital. Hospital patients may need oxygen, moist air through a facemask, and intravenous (IV) fluids. In rare, but life-threatening cases, a patient may need a ventilator (a machine to help you breathe).

The medicine Synagis (palivizumab) has been approved for the prevention of RSV in children under 2. This medicine is for children who are at high risk. Talk to your doctor about this medicine.","A mild case of respiratory syncytial virus is like having a cold for 2 weeks. Those who have to be hospitalized will experience more discomfort (difficulty breathing). Generally, most people who have RSV fully recover.

375,Sarcoidosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sarcoidosis/,"Sarcoidosis is a disease in which immune cells form small lumps, called granulomas, in your organs. Experts believe that inflammation causes these granulomas to form. The inflammation could be triggered by an infection or exposure to certain substances in your environment.

Sarcoidosis is most common in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. If you have this disease, you may not have any","symptoms. Or you may have serious problems with many different parts of your body.

The exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. It is most common in adults between 20 and 40 years of age. It’s more common in women than in men. Worldwide, it occurs more often in African Americans and northern Europeans, especially people from Scandinavia.

Sarcoidosis is not contagious. This means you can’t catch sarcoidosis from another person who has the disease.

Many people who have sarcoidosis have few, if any, symptoms. (Often, sarcoidosis is found when a chest X-ray is done for another reason.) Some people will have general feelings of illness, such as fatigue, fever, or swelling and pain in the joints. Others will experience symptoms based on the part of the body that is affected.

The most common symptoms of sarcoidosis involve the lungs, skin, eyes, and liver.","Doctors don’t know the exact cause of sarcoidosis. They think having certain genes makes it more likely that a person will develop the disease. Triggers of the disease could include infection with a bacteria or virus, or contact with something in your environment, such as dust or chemicals.

You are at higher risk of developing sarcoidosis if you:

• Are female.
• Work or live around substances that cause inflammation, such as insecticides or mold.
• Have had lymphoma, a type of blood cancer.
• Are of African or Scandinavian descent.
• Have a close relative who has sarcoidosis.","To find out if you have sarcoidosis, your doctor will perform a physical exam. Then you may undergo a variety of tests, as he or she will want to rule out other diseases that can cause similar symptoms. They may order blood tests, imaging tests, or a biopsy (tissue sample) of an affected organ. Blood tests can help look for other conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Imaging tests could include X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, or ultrasound. These tests can be used to look for granulomas. A biopsy can also show if you have granulomas.","There is no way to avoid getting sarcoidosis. If you are at higher risk for the disease, it may be better for you to avoid environmental substances that are known to trigger it. These could include insecticides, mold, or other substances. Talk to your doctor about what substances you should avoid.","Not everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment. Sometimes it goes away on its own. Your treatment will depend on your symptoms, which organs are affected, and how those organs are working.

Your doctor will probably treat sarcoidosis if it involves your kidneys, eyes, heart, nervous system, or lungs (especially if breathing problems are getting worse). He or she will treat the disease if you have skin lesions that bother you or if your sarcoidosis is severe. Your doctor will try to do the following:

• Reduce any inflammation that may interfere with the way your organs work.
• Prevent permanent scarring of the lungs if they’re affected.
• Decrease any symptoms you have.

Many medicines can be used to treat sarcoidosis. The most common are called corticosteroids. They help your condition by reducing inflammation. How long you take the medicine depends on how severe the disease is and how well you respond to the medicine. Other medicines are sometimes used to treat more severe forms of sarcoidosis.",null,"• How will sarcoidosis affect me?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","The lungs are the most commonly affected part of the body in people who have sarcoidosis. Lung or chest symptoms include:

• Chest pain.
• Dry cough.
• Shortness of breath.
• Coughing up blood (this is rare, but it is serious).

Sarcoidosis may cause skin problems. These could include:

• Hair loss.
• Skin sores (raised, red, firm, usually on the front of the lower legs).
• Rash.
• Scars that become raised or inflamed.

Eye symptoms caused by sarcoidosis can make it hard to see, but they rarely cause blindness. They include:

• Dry eyes.
• Itching.
• Burning or pain.
• Discharge from the eye or watery eyes.

Sarcoidosis can cause a person’s liver to become enlarged. Some people have abnormal liver tests and/or a liver problem called cirrhosis. However, this is rare.

Symptoms are much less common in other areas of the body, but may include:

• Nervous system.The nervous system isn’t usually affected by sarcoidosis. But the disease can cause muscle weakness or paralysis, seizures, tremors (shaking), poor coordination, hearing loss, or problems walking.
• Sarcoidosis can cause the heart to beat abnormally. It can also cause the heart to be unable to pump blood properly. This is called congestive heart failure.
• Symptoms involving the bones may include pain, swelling and joint stiffness. The hands and feet are most often affected.
• A very small percentage of people who have sarcoidosis have symptoms involving their kidneys, such as kidney stones.

In many people, sarcoidosis gets better all by itself. Women and people who have less severe lung involvement usually do the best. If you have sarcoidosis, you should discuss your illness in more detail with your family doctor. You and your doctor should work together as partners to create a treatment plan that is right for you.

There are many factors that will determine how often you see your doctor. This includes how severe your symptoms are, which organs are affected, your treatment, and if you have any side effects. Even if you don’t have any symptoms, it is important to see your doctor for ongoing care.

Sometimes serious sarcoidosis is left untreated or treatment doesn’t work. Then there may be complications. The continued inflammation can cause scarring. This scarring can cause serious or life-threatening damage to the organs, which could result in:

• Vision loss or blindness.
• Heart complications, such as heart failure or heart attack.
• Kidney conditions, such as kidney stones or kidney failure.
• Cirrhosis of the liver.
• Lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis.
• Problems with the nervous system, including brain tumors, meningitis, or nerve pain.

Most of these problems are avoidable if you get proper treatment. Don’t ignore any symptoms you are having. Stay in regular contact with your doctor and attend all follow-up appointments."
376,Scarlet Fever,https://familydoctor.org/condition/scarlet-fever/,"Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection. The disease used to be more common and severe, but now it is treatable. However, it can cause harmful health problems if left untreated. Scarlet fever is linked to a rash, hence the name “scarlet.”","Children ages 5 to 15 are at greatest risk of getting scarlet fever. Symptoms often begin within 1 or 2 days of infection. The most common symptoms are fever, sore throat, and a rash. The rash can cover your neck, chest, arms, and legs.

• Chills
• Swollen tongue, tonsils, or glands
• White coating or red bumps on tongue
• Stomach pain
• Headache
• Muscle aches
• Vomiting
• Diarrhea",Group A streptococcus bacteria causes scarlet fever. This is the same infection that causes strep throat and can lead to rheumatic fever.

They also will swab your throat or do blood work to check for a strep infection.,"There is no vaccine for scarlet fever. The only way to prevent it is to avoid sick people. This way you reduce your risk of catching the infection. If you have scarlet fever, you should stay home from work or school and avoid travel.","If you have scarlet fever, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics. These will kill the bacteria in your body. They will make you not contagious after 24 hours. Make sure you take all the medicine to get rid of the infection.","With treatment, you can recover from scarlet fever. The rash may take a few weeks to go away.

If you have scarlet fever and do not treat it, you’re at risk. It can lead to rheumatic fever, which can cause serious health problems. Complications are rare, but can include kidney, liver, or heart damage. You may get an ear, sinus, or skin infection, pneumonia, or arthritis. In rare cases, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream. This can cause sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection.

377,Schizophrenia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/schizophrenia/,"Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that interferes with the way you think, feel, and act. It makes it hard for you to think clearly and make decisions. It is also hard for you to relate to people and act appropriately in social situations. People with schizophrenia can have trouble telling the difference between what’s real and what’s not. For example, they may hear voices that aren’t there or think that someone is out to get them.

Schizophrenia occurs in both women and men. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 16 and 30. It is a lifelong condition. It can be disabling to work and school life as well as relationships if not treated and regularly managed.","Symptoms of schizophrenia usually develop slowly over time. They fall into multiple categories.

These are symptoms that often appear during psychotic episodes.

• Hallucinations – Sensing something that isn’t there. Hearing and seeing things are the most common. Many people with schizophrenia hear voices. Others may smell strange odors or feel something on the skin that isn’t there.
• Delusions – When a person believes something that isn’t true. These are often strange or extreme beliefs. They may believe that someone is trying to hurt them or is putting thoughts into their head.

These reflect the absence of or reduction in certain appropriate behaviors. They can sometimes be confused with symptoms of depression.

• Limited range of emotions
• Speaking in a flat, disconnected way
• Withdrawal from family, friends, and social activities
• Low energy
• Lack of motivation
• Loss of pleasure or interest in life
• Poor hygiene and grooming habits

• Confused, disordered thinking or speech
• Trouble organizing thoughts
• Speaking in words or sentences that don’t make sense
• Repetitive body movements, such as pacing
• Catatonia, when a person stops moving or talking for a period of time

• Difficulty in understanding information and using it to make decisions
• Problems with focusing or paying attention
• Trouble with using information immediately after learning it

There is a misperception that people who have schizophrenia are violent. This is not true. In fact, most people who have the disorder are more likely to be harmed by someone else. They are at a higher risk of being taken advantage of by others, as well.","There isn’t one known cause of schizophrenia. Researchers have found that your risk of developing the illness could be higher if:

• You have a family history of psychosis
• You were exposed to viruses or malnutrition before you were born
• You have brain chemistry issues, especially with some neurotransmitters
• You took mind-altering drugs when you were a teenager or young adult
• Psychosocial factors (poverty, stressful or dangerous living environment, loneliness, job issues, relationship status, etc.)","If you or a family member have symptoms of schizophrenia, see your family doctor. They will review your medical history and ask you about your symptoms. Your doctor may order tests, such as blood tests or brain scans. These can help rule out physical conditions that have similar symptoms.

Your doctor may refer you to a psychologist or a psychiatrist. They will assess your symptoms, talk to your family, and observe your behavior over time. To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a person must experience at least 2 symptoms regularly for at least 6 months.

Schizophrenia can be hard to diagnose and it can mimic other mental illnesses. There aren’t any tests for it. Substance abuse, medicines, or other medical conditions can produce some of the same symptoms. Many people diagnosed with schizophrenia don’t believe they have it. In those cases, friends and family members must make sure the person gets help.",Schizophrenia can’t be prevented or avoided. Symptoms may be avoided by taking medicines as prescribed by your doctor.,"There is no cure for schizophrenia. However, treatments can help people manage their symptoms and improve their daily lives, especially in achieve personal life goals, such as completing education, pursuing a career, and having fulfilling relationships.

Schizophrenia requires lifelong treatment, even when you don’t have symptoms. Treatment should reduce the number of times you relapse, and improve your quality of life. Medicine and support therapy are the most common forms of treatment.

People with schizophrenia commonly take antipsychotic medicines. These change the balance of chemicals in your brain and help manage symptoms. Some can cause side effects. You might need to try different medicines to find one that works for you.

Support therapy helps people with schizophrenia manage their illness. This can include one-on-one counseling, training in social skills, family therapy, and job support.

When symptoms are severe, people with schizophrenia may need to stay in the hospital. This will make sure they stay safe and are taken care of.","Schizophrenia doesn’t ever go away, but it can be managed. Many people can control their symptoms with medicine. Therapy, case management, job, and social support help people with their recovery. In the early stages of the illness, relapses and recurring episodes are common. Symptoms and relapses tend to decrease over time if a person continues to take their medicine and receives support. Some people with schizophrenia can live on their own.

378,Scleroderma,https://familydoctor.org/condition/scleroderma/,"Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune disorder made up of a group of diseases. There are 2 types of scleroderma: localized and systemic. Localized scleroderma affects primarily the skin. Systemic scleroderma affects the skin, as well as blood vessels and internal organs.

Scleroderma causes your body to produce too much collagen. Collagen is a protein that makes up connective tissues, such as the skin. When you have too much collagen, your skin can stretch, thicken, and harden. It also can cause damage to internal organs, such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.","Within localized scleroderma, there are 2 forms:

• With 1 form, symptoms start with red patches of skin that thicken into hard, oval-shaped areas. The patches later become white in the middle with purple borders. Patches often appear on your chest, stomach, and back, but also can occur on your face, arms, and legs. You may have 1 or more patches as small as half an inch or as large as 12 inches in diameter.
• With the other form, the main symptom is a line or band of skin that thickens and changes color. This line can appear on your arm, leg, or forehead. Linear scleroderma is more common in children.

Within systemic scleroderma, there are 2 forms:

• Limited scleroderma progresses gradually. It affects the skin on your fingers, hands, lower arms, legs, and face. It causes patches of skin to become thick and firm and change color. People who have this also may have Raynaud’s disease or problems with frequent heartburn. Limited scleroderma also can affect your lungs, esophagus, and blood vessels.
• Diffuse scleroderma progresses quickly. Symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, and joint swelling and pain. It can affect the skin all over your body, causing it to swell and become tight, shiny, and itchy. Over time, your skin may go back to normal. Diffuse scleroderma also can damage internal organs, such as your intestines, lungs, kidneys, and heart.",The exact cause of scleroderma is unknown. It occurs when your immune system attacks your body’s tissues and/or organs.,"Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. He or she also will perform a physical exam and look for changes in the appearance of your skin. Your doctor may want to remove a small sample of skin (biopsy) to look at it under a microscope. He or she also may order a blood test to check for antibodies, or other tests to see if any internal organs have been affected. All of this helps to determine if you have scleroderma.",You can’t prevent or avoid scleroderma.,"Your doctor will choose the right treatment for you depending on your type and symptoms. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing more damage. Possible treatments include medicine, such as creams for your skin. He or she may also recommend dietary and lifestyle changes. Your doctor may suggest physical or occupational therapy to help you manage your pain. Cosmetic surgery may help to lessen the effects of scleroderma on your skin.

Localized scleroderma sometimes goes away on its own. If scleroderma has caused internal damage, your doctor may work with specialists to treat your condition. For example, if scleroderma affects your heart, your doctor will work closely with a heart specialist (cardiologist).","There is no cure for scleroderma. The best thing you can do is to work with your doctor(s) to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Plus, there are things you can do on your own that may help.

If you have skin problems, try to keep your skin soft and moisturized. Apply lotions often, wear sunscreen outside, and use a humidifier at home. Avoid harsh skin products, as well as hot showers and baths.

If you have heartburn or other digestive problems, try to eat small, frequent meals. Don’t lay down right after eating. Avoid spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine, and other things that trigger heartburn.

If you have Raynaud’s disease, you can relieve symptoms by:

• Not smoking
• Wearing warm clothes, including socks and gloves, if needed
• Doing regular exercise
• Avoiding things that cause increased stress or anxiety

Talk to your doctor about other ways to help improve blood flow, including medicine. He or she also may prescribe medicines to treat skin patches, sores, and lesions.

Be sure to contact your doctor if you have new or worsening symptoms or health problems.","• What type of scleroderma do I have?

It also can be caused or worsened by repeated use of one side more than the other, such as in a certain motion or activity.","Contact your doctor if you have back pain or other signs of scoliosis. Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your health and family history. If your doctor is concerned about the curve, they likely will order an X-ray to get a better view of the spine.

Your family doctor may check for scoliosis at regular check-ups. Some schools screen children for the condition.",You cannot prevent or avoid scoliosis.,"Mild cases of scoliosis do not require treatment. Your doctor may want to monitor your condition to see if it gets worse. The curve of the spine may be temporary or permanent. It often can improve with time, especially for children as they grow.

Your doctor may have you wear a brace. This keeps the spine from curving more. Newer braces are light and less bulky than old braces. Most braces fit under clothes and are not visible.

People who have severe scoliosis may need surgery. The surgeon will move the bones in your spine, fuse them together to strengthen the spine, or place a rod in your spine to help straighten it. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of surgery. These will depend on your age, state of health, and amount of curve.","For most people, the curve in their spine is so small that it causes no problems. Treatment can improve or manage the condition. In rare cases, the curve may restrict the amount of space available for your lungs and heart to work.","• How severe is the curve of my spine?
• Is my scoliosis temporary or permanent?
• Will I need to wear a brace or have surgery?
• What are the benefits and risks of surgery?
• Is physical therapy an option?
• Is it safe to exercise?
• Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to help straighten my spine?
• Will scoliosis cause any long-term health problems?","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases: Scoliosis in Children and Teens

380,Seasonal Affective Disorder,https://familydoctor.org/condition/seasonal-affective-disorder/,Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that is triggered by the seasons of the year. Symptoms usually begin in late fall or early winter. People with SAD usually feel better in the spring and summer. It is thought that SAD is related to changes in the amount of daylight during different times of the year. Some people have SAD with depressive episodes in the summer instead of winter. This is much less common.,"Not everyone who has SAD experiences the same symptoms. Common symptoms of winter-onset SAD include:

• Change in appetite, especially craving sweet or starchy foods
• Weight gain
• Fatigue
• Sleeping more than normal
• Difficulty concentrating
• Irritability and anxiety
• Increased sensitivity to rejection
• Avoidance of social situations
• Loss of interest in the activities you used to enjoy
• Feelings of guilt or hopelessness
• Physical problems, such as headaches

Symptoms of summer-onset SAD include:

• Loss of appetite
• Weight loss
• Insomnia
• Irritability and anxiety
• Agitation

Symptoms of SAD tend to come back year after year. They usually come and go at about the same time every year. If you think this could be happening to you, call your family doctor.","In most cases, SAD seems to be related to the loss of sunlight in the fall and winter. Researchers have found that reduced sunlight can affect the body in ways that could contribute to SAD. These include:

Circadian rhythm (biological clock) – The decrease in sunlight could disrupt your body’s natural rhythms. This could lead to feelings of depression.

Serotonin levels – Serotonin is a brain chemical that affects your mood. Reduced sunlight could cause serotonin levels to drop. This could trigger depression.

Melatonin levels – Melatonin is a brain chemical that regulates sleep. More darkness causes the body to produce more melatonin. More melatonin could make you feel more tired and lethargic. These are common symptoms of depression.

Vitamin D levels – It is believed that vitamin D plays a role in serotonin levels. Much of the vitamin D we get is from the sun. Less sunlight could lead to a deficiency in vitamin D. This can cause depression symptoms.

Some people have a higher risk of developing SAD. Factors that increase risk include:

• Being female. Four times as many women are diagnosed with SAD than men.
• Living far from the equator. In the United States, living farther north increases your risk. These areas get less sunlight in fall and winter.
• Family history. Having family members with SAD or other forms of depression increases your risk.
• Having depression or bipolar disorder. If you have one of these conditions, your symptoms may worsen with the seasons.
• Young age. SAD is more common among younger adults. It has been reported in teens and children. Your chances of getting it decrease as you get older.","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings, and behavior. They may perform a physical exam. They may request lab tests to rule out other conditions that cause symptoms similar to SAD. They may refer you to a specialist to diagnose your condition. This could be a psychologist or a psychiatrist",Can SAD be prevented or avoided. There’s not much you can do to avoid getting SAD. But you can take steps to manage it so your symptoms don’t get worse. Some people start treatment before their symptoms start. They also continue treatment past the time that their symptoms normally go away. Others need continuous treatment to control their symptoms.,"The three main ways SAD is treated are with light therapy, behavioral therapy, or medicine. Your doctor may want to combine therapies if using one does not work for you.

Light therapy is designed to make up for the lack of sunlight during the fall and winter. It has been used to treat SAD since the 1980s. You will sit in front of a special light box every day. The box emits a bright white light that mimics natural sunlight. It seems to make a change in brain chemicals that regulate your mood. The amount of time you sit in front of the light box depends on the strength of the light. It is usually between 20 and 60 minutes.

There are other types of light therapy. Instead of sitting in front of a box, you can wear a visor that emits light. Another kind is a “dawn simulator.” This light turns on early in the morning in your bedroom. It mimics a natural sunrise and gradually increases in brightness. This allows you to wake up naturally, without using an alarm.

If light therapy helps, you’ll continue it until enough sunlight returns. This usually happens in spring. Stopping light therapy too soon can result in a return of symptoms.

When used properly, light therapy seems to have very few side effects. Some side effects include eyestrain, headache, fatigue, and irritability. If you use it too late in the day, you could have trouble sleeping. Talk to your doctor before starting light therapy if you have:

• Bipolar disorder
• Skin that is sensitive to sunlight
• Conditions that make your eyes vulnerable to sunlight damage

Tanning beds should not be used to treat SAD. The light sources in tanning beds are high in ultraviolet (UV) rays. These harm your eyes and your skin. They also cause skin cancer.

Talk therapy or behavioral therapy can help you identify negative thoughts. Then you replace those with more positive thoughts. Therapy can help you learn healthy ways to manage your symptoms of SAD. You can also learn how to manage stress.","The keys to living with SAD are to plan ahead and to manage your symptoms.

• Follow your treatment plan. This includes going to appointments, taking medicines, and following up if things aren’t working.
• Take care of your body. Eat healthy foods and get enough sleep.
• Exercise has been shown to have the same effect on depression as antidepressants.
• Have a plan. Know what you will do when your depression symptoms start to get worse. Watch for early signs and take action before you feel bad.
• Don’t turn to alcohol or drugs. They make depression worse. They can also have negative reactions with antidepressants.
• Manage stress. You can’t avoid stress, so you have to learn to manage it. Talk to a counselor or read about ways to handle stress better.
• Don’t isolate. It’s harder to be social when you’re depressed. But being alone can make you feel worse. Try to reach out as much as you can.
• Start treatment early. If you know your symptoms usually start in October, start your treatments in September, before symptoms start. You might be able to prevent them.
• Plan ahead. Some people purposely plan their lives to be very busy during the time they normally feel down. This helps prevent them from “hiding out” at home, because they have already made commitments.
• Take a trip. Plan a trip to a warmer, sunnier climate during the winter. The positive feelings will extend before, during, and after your trip.","• What treatment is best for me?
• Should I use light therapy?
• What changes can I make at home to help myself?
• What is causing my SAD?
• How long will I have to continue treatment?
• Should I talk with a counselor?
• Should I make any changes to my diet?
• Could exercise help me deal with SAD?","National Institute of Mental Health, Seasonal Affective Disorder

Another 10% to 20% may experience it in a milder form. SAD is more common in women than in men. Some children and teenagers get SAD. But it usually doesn’t start in people younger than 20 years of age. The risk of SAD decreases for adults as they age. SAD is more common in northern regions of the United States. Winters are typically longer and harsher there. There is also less sunlight because they are farther away from the equator.

Your doctor might recommend you take medicine to help with your symptoms, especially if they are severe. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used to treat depression. Some have been approved to treat SAD specifically.

You may have to take the medicine for several weeks before you feel better. You may have to try more than one medicine to find the one that works best for you.

You can also make lifestyle changes that can help your symptoms.

• Let as much natural light as possible into your home or office. Open blinds, sit close to windows, and keep your environments as bright as possible.
• Get outside when you can. Even if it’s cold or cloudy, the light can still benefit you.
• Keep physically active. Exercise and activity boost endorphins and relieve stress. Both of these can keep you feeling better."
381,Seborrheic Dermatitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/seborrheic-dermatitis/,"Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition. It affects the scalp, face or inside the ear. The affected areas have white to yellowish flakes. The skin also can be red and greasy. When adults get it on their scalp, it’s commonly called “dandruff.” In babies, it is known as “cradle cap.” Seborrheic dermatitis can appear on other parts of the body. This includes the chest, creases of the arms, legs and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is common in babies younger than three months of age and in adults. In adults. It’s more likely to affect adult men than women.","Seborrheic dermatitis symptoms include:

• White to yellowish flakes of skin
• Red skin (in some cases)
• Greasy or oily skin
• Itching
• Hair loss","Doctors don’t know the exact cause of seborrheic dermatitis. The cause may be different in babies and adults. It may run in families. One cause may be hormones. It usually appears in babies and disappears before puberty. Another cause may be a fungus. The fungus is called malassezia. It is present on the skin in small numbers. Sometimes the numbers increase and lead to skin problems.

Seborrheic dermatitis has been linked to neurologic disorders. This includes Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury and stroke. Doctors do not know why. Other factors include:

• Oil gland activity
• Changes in your skin’s barrier function
• Weather extremes
• Stress or fatigue
• Heavy alcohol use
• Lotions that contain alcohol
• Obesity
• Having HIV/AIDs","Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam of your skin and scalp. If your doctor is uncertain about whether you have the condition, he or she may have you get a skin biopsy. This involved in cutting or scraping off a small sample of the affected skin. This step is rare.","If the condition is genetic, it cannot be prevented. Most other causes cannot be prevented. However, you can reduce the severity of symptoms. Controlling risk factors and careful skin care can help. This includes avoiding lotions that contain alcohol, using special skin products recommended by your doctor, protecting yourself from HIV/AIDs, losing weight and getting plenty of rest.","Treatment depends on your age and location of the symptoms. Several over-the-counter and medicated shampoos can relieve the flaking and dryness. You do not need a prescription for these products. Look for a product that says it treats seborrheic dermatitis. Important ingredients include salicylic acid, coal tar, zinc, resorcin, ketoconazole and selenium sulfide.

• Adult and adolescent scalp (dandruff): Effective shampoos that contain salicylic acid and zinc include the brand names: Scalpicin, X-Seb, Exsel, Selsun Blue, DHS Zinc and Head & Shoulders. These shampoos can be used twice a week. Shampoos that contain coal tar include DHS Tar, Neutrogena T/Gel and Polytar. These may be used 3 times a week. If you have dandruff, start by using one of these shampoos daily until your dandruff is controlled. The use it two or three times a week. Rub the shampoo into your hair thoroughly and let it stay on your hair and scalp for at least 5 minutes. Then rinse. If the shampoo alone doesn’t help, your doctor might want you to use a prescription steroid lotion once or twice daily.

• Adult and adolescent skin creases:Steroid lotions may be used in adolescents and adults.

• Infant scalp (cradle cap): Baby products are not as strong as those used for adults. Start with a mild, nonmedicated baby shampoo. Use mineral oil, olive oil or petrolatum jelly to loosen the flakes. Brush your baby’s scalp with a soft brush, like a toothbrush to loosen flakes. But be gentle when massaging or brushing your baby’s scalp. A break in the skin could lead to an infection. If a nonmedicated shampoo doesn’t work, talk to your doctor about switching to a shampoo that contains tar. Your doctor may recommend a prescription shampoo such as Nizoral.

• Infant skin creases: Mild steroid lotions or creams may be used to treat seborrheic dermatitis in the skin creases of babies. Talk to your family doctor about the correct steroid strength.

Other treatments that could help include phototherapy. This is a medical procedure in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. Moderate sunlight is helpful.","Seborrheic dermatitis is considered chronic. Also, it is a life-long condition. It comes and goes, and it can be controlled with treatment. The negative effects of living with the condition are additional fungal infections and emotional distress. Most people who live with seborrheic dermatitis feel embarrassed and have low self-esteem.","• Will adult products harm a baby with the condition?
• Can wearing a hat help?
• Is seborrheic dermatitis a sign of another disease?
• Is hair loss a common symptom?","U.S. National Library of Medicine, Seborrheic dermatitis

382,Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD),https://familydoctor.org/condition/sensory-processing-disorder-spd/,"Sensory processing disorder (SPD) is a condition that affects how your brain processes sensory information (stimuli). Sensory information includes things you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. SPD can affect all of your senses, or just one. SPD usually means you’re overly sensitive to stimuli that other people are not. But the disorder can cause the opposite effect, too. In these cases, it takes more stimuli to impact you. On the other hand, lack of sensory input can impact your social and emotional health. For example, hearing loss has been shown to increase the risk of developing dementia because it causes social isolation and depression.

Children are more likely than adults to have SPD. But adults can have symptoms, too. In adults, it’s likely these symptoms have existed since childhood. However, the adults have developed ways to deal with SPD that let them hide the disorder from others.

There is some debate among doctors about whether SPD is a separate disorder. Some doctors argue it isn’t. Some say it’s a diagnosis for things that could be explained as common behavior for children. Others say some children are just highly sensitive. Some doctors say that SPD is a symptom of other disorders—such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, etc.—and not a disorder itself. Other doctors believe your child may suffer from SPD without having another disorder. Some say it’s clear that some children have trouble handling regular sensory information (stimuli). For now, SPD isn’t recognized as an official medical diagnosis. Even so, it is a way to identify those who may need some extra attention in this area.","SPD can affect one sense or multiple senses. Children who have SPD may overreact to sounds, clothing, and food textures. Or they may underreact to sensory input. This causes them to crave more intense thrill-seeking stimuli. Some examples include jumping off tall things or swinging too high on the playground. Also, children with SPD are not always just one or the other. They can be a mixture of oversensitive and under-sensitive.

Children may be oversensitive if they:

• Think clothing feels too scratchy or itchy
• Think lights seem too bright
• Think sounds seem too loud
• Think soft touches feel too hard
• Experience food textures that make them gag
• Have poor balance or seem clumsy
• Are afraid to play on the swings
• React poorly to sudden movements, touches, loud noises, or bright lights
• Have behavior problems

Sometimes these symptoms are linked to poor motor skills as well. Your child may have trouble holding a pencil or scissors. They may have trouble climbing stairs or have low muscle tone. They also may have language delays.

In older children, these symptoms may cause low self-confidence. That may lead to social isolation and even depression.

Children may be under-sensitive (sensory-seeking) if they:

• Can’t sit still
• Seek thrills (loves jumping, heights, and spinning)
• Can spin without getting dizzy
• Don’t pick up on social cues
• Don’t recognize personal space
• Chew on things (including their hands and clothing)
• Seek visual stimulation (like electronics)
• Have problems sleeping
• Don’t recognize when their face is dirty or nose is running","Doctors don’t know what causes SPD. They’re exploring a genetic link, which means it could run in families. Some doctors believe there could be a link between autism and SPD. This could mean that adults who have autism could be more likely to have children who have SPD. But it’s important to note that most people who have SPD don’t have autism.",Parents may recognize their child’s behavior is not typical. But most parents may not know why. Don’t be afraid to discuss your child’s behavior with your doctor. They may refer you to an occupational therapist. These professionals can assess your child for SPD. They will likely watch your child interact in certain situations. The therapist will ask your child questions. All of these things will help make a diagnosis.,SPD can’t be prevented or avoided because doctors don’t know what causes it.,"Treatment is usually done through therapy. Research shows that starting therapy early is key for treating SPD. Therapy can help children learn how to manage their challenges.

Therapy sessions are led by a trained therapist. He or she will help you and your child learn how to cope with the disorder. Sessions are based on if your child is oversensitive, under-sensitive, or a combination of both.

There are different types of therapy:

Sensory integration therapy (SI). This type of therapy uses fun activities in a controlled environment. With the therapist, your child experiences stimuli without feeling overwhelmed. They can develop coping skills for dealing with that stimuli. Through this therapy, these coping skills can become a regular, everyday response to stimuli.

Sensory diet. Many times, a sensory diet will supplement other SPD therapies. A sensory diet isn’t your typical food diet. It’s a list of sensory activities for home and school. These activities are designed to help your child stay focused and organized during the day. Like SI, a sensory diet is customized based on your child’s needs. A sensory diet at school might include:

• A time every hour when your child could go for a 10-minute walk
• A time twice a day when your child could swing for 10 minutes
• Access to in-class headphones so your child can listen to music while working
• Access to fidget toys
• Access to a desk chair bungee cord. This gives your child a way to move their legs while sitting in the classroom.

Occupational therapy. Your child also may need this therapy to help with other symptoms related to SPD. It can help with fine motor skills, such as handwriting and using scissors. Therapy also can help with gross motor skills, such as climbing stairs and throwing a ball. It can teach everyday skills, such as getting dressed and how to use utensils.

If your child has a sensory deficit, such as a hearing loss, hearing aids can help. Talk to your doctor about being tested for a hearing loss and the hearing aid options that could work for your child.","Living with SPD can be hard. Parents of children with SPD can feel alone. They may avoid taking their child out in public to avoid sensory overload. Parents may also feel like they need to make excuses for their child’s behavior.

Adults who have SPD may feel isolated, too. Sensory overload can prevent them from leaving the house. This can make it difficult to go to the store or even to work.

Adults who are struggling with SPD should work with an occupational therapist. The therapist may be able to help them learn new reactions to stimuli. This can lead to changes in how they deal with certain situations. And that may lead to an improved lifestyle.

Sometimes, even if SPD gets better with therapy or age, it may never go away. A major life event or stress can trigger symptoms.

If you are an adult with a hearing loss, talk to your doctor about getting a hearing test and the available options for prescription and over-the-counter hearing aids.","• How can I determine whether I have/my child has SPD?
• I have/my child has SPD. Now what?
• How can I help my young child have fun at the playground if they have SPD?
• Can my child live a normal life?
• How might my child react to certain stimuli?
• Will SPD go away as my child gets older?
• Are there any medicines that help SPD?
• Can you help me find out if my insurance will cover therapy?","Child Mind Institute: Sensory Processing Issues Explained

383,Sever's Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/severs-disease/,Sever’s disease is a common heel injury that occurs in children. It is painful and caused by swelling of the growth plate in the heel. Children can injure this growth plate through typical weight-bearing activity (activity performed while standing).,Sever’s disease can cause heel pain in one or both heels. It usually starts after a child begins a new sports season or a new sport. Your child may walk with a limp. The pain may increase when he or she runs or jumps. You may notice your child tiptoeing to avoid putting pressure on his or her heel. You may notice swelling or redness in the heel area.,"The foot is one of the first body parts to grow to full size. This usually happens in early puberty. During this time, bones often grow faster than muscles and tendons. As a result, muscles and tendons become tight, making the heel area less flexible. During weight-bearing activity, the tight heel tendons may put too much pressure at the back of the heel (where the Achilles tendon attaches). This can injure the heel and cause Sever’s disease.",Your child’s symptoms will play a big role in the diagnosis. The doctor will also examine the injured heel. He or she may squeeze both sides of the back of the heel to see if it causes pain. This is called the squeeze test.,"Sever’s disease may be prevented by maintaining good flexibility. Stretching exercises can lower your child’s risk for injuries during the growth spurt. Talk with your doctor for more advice. Quality shoes with firm support and a shock-absorbent sole will help, too. Your child should avoid excessive running on hard surfaces.

If your child has already recovered from Sever’s disease, stretching and putting ice on the heel after activity will help keep your child from developing this condition again.","First, your child should cut down or stop any activity that causes heel pain. Apply ice to the injured heel for 20 minutes 3 times a day. If your child has a high arch, flat feet, or bowed legs, your doctor may recommend orthotics, arch supports, or heel cups. Your child should never go barefoot.

If your child has severe heel pain, medicines such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) may help.","No long-term problems have been linked to Sever’s disease. However, call your doctor if your child’s heel pain does not get better with treatment, gets worse, or if you notice changes in skin color or swelling.","• What could have caused my child’s symptoms?
• What is the best treatment option for my child?
• How long before my child can expect relief from his/her symptoms?
• When can my child return to his/her sport/activity?
• Is it possible that my child’s symptoms could return?
• Is it safe for my child to exercise? What kind of exercise should he/she do?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.",null,"Your child is most at risk for injury in early puberty during a growth spurt. Sever’s disease is most common in physically active girls 8 years to 10 years of age. It is most common in physically active boys 10 years to 12 years of age. Soccer players and gymnasts often get Sever’s disease. But children who do any running or jumping activity may also be at an increased risk. Sever’s disease rarely occurs in older teenagers because the back of the heel has typically finished growing by 15 years of age.

Yes, stretching exercises can help. It is important that your child performs exercises to stretch the hamstring and calf muscles, and the tendons on the back of the leg. The child should do these stretches 2 or 3 times a day, holding each stretch for about 20 seconds. Your child should stretch both legs, even if the pain is only in 1 heel.

Your child also needs to do exercises to strengthen the muscles on the front of the shin. To do this, your child should sit on the floor, keeping his or her hurt leg straight. Hook one end of a bungee cord or piece of rubber tubing around a table leg. Hitch the other end around the child’s toes. Your child should scoot back just far enough to stretch the cord. Next, your child should slowly bend the foot toward his or her body. When the child cannot bend the foot any closer, he or she slowly points the foot in the opposite direction (toward the table). Your child should do this exercise (15 repetitions of “foot curling”) about 3 times each day.

With proper care, your child should feel better within 2 weeks to 2 months. Your child can start playing sports again only when the heel pain is gone. Your doctor will let you know when physical activity is safe."
384,Sexual Dysfunction in Men and Women,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sexual-dysfunction/,"When you have problems with sex, doctors call it “sexual dysfunction.” It happens in both men and women. Sexual problems become more common in men and women as they age. Other factors can cause it in younger people. Stress, illness, medicines, or emotional problems can contribute to sexual dysfunction. Talk to your doctor if it lasts longer than a few months. Tell your doctor if it interferes with your relationship with your partner. Anything you tell your doctor is private. Your doctor can diagnose the problem. He or she can treat it.",It is common for couples to have problems with sex at some time in their relationship.,"Many things can cause problems in your sex life. This includes certain medicines (oral birth control and chemotherapy), diseases (diabetes or high blood pressure), excessive alcohol use or vaginal and urinary infections. Additional causes include depression, relationship problems, and abuse (current or past).

Hormones play a part in sexual dysfunction for men and women. Low male and female hormones lead to less sexual desire. Hormones decrease in men and women as they age. Female hormones can change during pregnancy, right after childbirth, or when you are breastfeeding. After menopause, many women feel less sexual desire. Also, menopause causes vaginal dryness, which can lead to pain during sex .

At any age, the stresses of everyday life can cause sexual dysfunction. Being tired from a busy job or caring for young children may affect your sexual desire. You may also be bored by a long-standing sexual routine.","Having an honest talk with your doctor can contribute to a diagnosis. Your doctor may be able to diagnose the problem from your description of the problem, your age, and stresses in your life. He or she may do a physical exam and lab tests, as well.","The process of aging cannot be prevented. Yet, there are many things men and women can do to reduce the impact of sexual dysfunction. This includes learning more about your body and how it works. Also:

• Ask your doctor about the side effects of the medicines you take. Talk to him or her about surgeries and health conditions. Treating underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, may help.
• Talk with a counselor or mental health professional if you are depressed, stressed or having relationship issues.
• Reduce your alcohol consumption, eat healthy, and get regular exercise.
• Talk to your partner about what you like and don’t like in your sexual relationship.
• Practice “sensate focus” exercises. This is where one partner gives a massage, while the other partner says what feels good and requests changes (example: “lighter,” “faster,” etc.). Fantasizing may increase your desire.
• For women, Kegel exercises (squeezing and relaxing the muscles of your vagina) may increase arousal.
• Try sexual activity other than intercourse, such as massage, oral sex, or masturbation.
• Do not use recreational drugs or abuse opioids.","• If desire is the problem, try changing your usual routine. Try having sex at different times of the day, or try a different sexual position. Talk with your partner about your likes and dislikes. Talk with your doctor about the side effects of the medicines you are taking and the use of hormone replacement therapy.
• Arousal disorders can be treated for women with the use a vaginal cream or sexual lubricant for dryness. If you have gone through menopause, talk to your doctor about taking estrogen or using an estrogen cream. Men who are dealing with arousal disorders should talk with their partners to discuss ways to improve arousal (such as foreplay or fantasies). Talk with your doctor about prescription treatment options (one example: Viagra). However, Viagra and hormone replacement therapy have immediate and long-term side effects.
• For women, pain during sex can be treated with hormone replacement therapy, different positions, or vaginal lubricants. For men and women, emptying your bladder before you have sex may help. Taking a warm bath before sex may help. Your doctor can help you find the cause of your pain and decide what treatment is best for you.","Depending on the cause of your sexual dysfunction, you may or may not have to live with it. Talk with your doctor about possible causes and treatments. Talk you’re your partner about reimagining your sex life. Talk with a sex therapist or counselor if needed.","• I’m having sexual problems. Is there something wrong with me?
• What can I do at home to help with my sexual problems?
• Could my symptoms be a sign of a more serious condition?
• Are there medical tests that could diagnose my problem?
• I’m worried that my problems will cause tension in my relationship. What should I do?

385,Shaken Baby Syndrome (Abusive Head Trauma),https://familydoctor.org/condition/abusive-head-trauma/,"Abusive head trauma is also called shaken baby syndrome. This is because it is most often caused by shaking a small child or infant so hard that it has a whiplash effect. It can also be caused by jerking, throwing, or hitting the child. Abusive head trauma is a form of child abuse that can be deadly or leave a baby seriously injured for a lifetime. Most often, victims of this kind of abuse are less than 1 year old, but it can happen with children up to age 5.","A severe case of abusive head trauma in your baby or young child can cause unconsciousness, seizures, or shock.

Other initial symptoms of abusive head trauma can include:

• Vomiting
• Irritability
• Unusual drowsiness
• No interest in eating or trouble sucking or swallowing
• Stiff appearance
• Changes in consciousness
• No smiling, babbling, or talking
• Differently sized pupils
• Inability to lift their head, focus eyes, or track movement

In many cases, abusive head trauma also leaves a child with long-term problems that affect them physically and intellectually. A survivor of abusive head trauma may be dependent on medical services, special education, and social services for the rest of their life.","Abusive head trauma happens when a baby is shaken violently, hit in the head, thrown, or dropped on purpose. It usually happens at the hands of an overwhelmed parent or caregiver who can’t cope with a baby’s long periods of crying and the demands of caring for a young child.

Violently shaking a young child or hitting them in the head causes the child’s brain to shake back and forth inside the skull. This is especially true in babies, whose neck muscles aren’t fully developed. The movement causes your child’s brain to swell, bruise, and bleed from the tearing of blood vessels, nerves, and tissue.

Throwing a baby up in the air and catching them is also not a good idea. It can cause the exact same damage as if they were shaken.",null,"Because this happens due to a caregiver’s actions, it is absolutely possible to prevent abusive head trauma. It is important for everyone who takes care of your baby or young child to learn how to handle stressful situations (for example, when your baby cries for a long time).

One way to handle stress is taking several deep breaths, finding a safe place for your child (for example, the crib), and walking to another room for 10 to 15 minutes to calm yourself. When you feel out of control, call a friend or family member to help with your child or help you regain control. Understanding the consequences of abusive head trauma can help you take an active role in preventing this with your child.

Soothing a crying baby is not easy. However, there are a number of things you can try to calm the baby, including:

• Singing
• Rocking
• Swaddling
• Taking them for a ride or a walk
• Breastfeeding
• Offering a bottle or pacifier
• Laying the baby on their stomach across your lap and gently rub or pat the baby’s back

Combining these strategies with “white noise” or rhythmic sounds (for example, music, a hair dryer, or a clothes dryer) can help. You also can try putting your child down for a nap on their left side to help with digestion, or on their back. If all else fails, be sure to consider whether your child could be sick. Call your doctor for advice.

If you have a caregiver for your child, it’s important to teach your caregiver about the dangers of shaking a baby or young child. Be sure they know what to do if they feel stressed while caring for your child. Choose a caregiver carefully and continue to monitor your child’s safety under their care.","For milder cases of abusive head trauma, your child may need medicine, a hospital stay, and at-home observation. In the most severe cases, treatment may begin in the hospital emergency room or operating room with life-saving steps. These steps might include inserting a breathing tube down your child’s throat or doing surgery to stop bleeding or reduce swelling in your child’s brain.","Depending on how severe the trauma is, your child may have to be monitored over time. Survivors of abusive head trauma may suffer long-term health problems, such as:

• Permanent hearing loss
• Visual impairment (including blindness)
• Seizures
• Developmental, speech, and academic delays
• Severe intellectual disability
• Memory and attention challenges
• Cerebral palsy","• How can I tell whether my baby’s symptoms are caused by abusive head trauma or a normal illness?
• Can brain damage be reversed?
• What are some local resources for helping parents cope?","The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","You should go to the emergency room right away if you suspect your child is suffering from abusive head trauma. Some symptoms of abusive head trauma (for example, vomiting or irritability) are also common in other illnesses. So it is important for the doctor to know if your child may have been shaken or hit in the head. The doctor will ask questions about what happened. Unfortunately, the person responsible for the abuse may not be honest about their actions.

The doctor will use a number of visual clues and tests to make the diagnosis and find out how severe the damage is. Visual clues include checking the child’s eyes for bleeding; looking for marks on the skull, arms, or legs; and checking for bruises around the child’s neck or chest. Certain imaging tests (for example, an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI) can show evidence of swelling or bleeding in the brain. These tests also can show skull or rib fractures."
386,Shin Splints,https://familydoctor.org/condition/shin-splints/,"Shin splints describe a type of pain in your shinbone (tibia). The pain is often caused by overuse (running and jumping). Shin splints usually heal within a few weeks, with rest and proper treatment.",You can get shin splints in one or both of your legs. Most people who have shin splints feel pain on the inside edge of their shinbones. Pain may be acute (sharp) or a dull ache. Your shins may hurt when you’re active. They can also hurt when you are inactive shortly after completing activity. The pain may be worse with pressure or exercise. It may improve with rest and at-home treatment.,"Shin splints occur from repeated and often high-impact motion. They cause inflammation where your muscles and tendons connect to your shinbone.

Some people have an increased risk of getting shin splints. This includes people who:

• Play sports (such as running, dancing, and gymnastics)
• Exercise on hard surfaces
• Wear ill-fitting or worn-out shoes
• Have flat feet
• Pronate (roll their feet in) when they walk or run
• Increase training times, levels, or distances too fast
• Are new to a high-impact sport","If you have pain that doesn’t improve with rest or your shin area is swollen, red, or hot to the touch, you should call your doctor.

Your doctor will review your symptoms, activity, and health history. They may order tests, including an X-ray or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This can rule out other issues, such as a stress fracture. This is a small crack along the bone.","Athletes who are at risk of shin splints can take some precautions. Runners should choose shoes that fit well and absorb shock. Shoes start to lose shock resistance after about 250 miles of use. Try running on softer surfaces, such as a track or treadmill. Do not increase training too fast if you are new or getting back into running. Dancers and gymnasts can exercise on sprung floors, if available. Cross training with low-impact activities also can help. Examples of these include swimming and using an elliptical machine.","Treatment for shin splints depends on the degree of your injury and your health. You can try at-home treatments, such as the following:

• Decrease activity or rest. Identify what motions affect your shins most and limit or stop these. If your pain doesn’t improve, switch to low impact exercises or rest from all activity.
• Ice your shins. You can ice your lower leg a few times a day. Use ice packs, ice massage, or an ice bath. This can help reduce swelling and ease pain.
• Pain medicine. You can take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or acetaminophen to relieve pain and swelling.
• Stretching. This is important to prevent and treat injuries. With shin splints, you should stretch your calves, Achilles tendons, and ankles well. Continue these stretches even after you are well.
• Massage. This also can help in releasing and relaxing your muscles. Try massaging your calves, Achilles tendons, and other muscles surrounding your shins.
• Kinesiology tape (KT tape). This is a type of flexible athletic tape. There are specific applications depending on your injury. KT tape may help relieve pain from shin splints and provide support.

Your doctor may recommend getting physical therapy. This can help with pain, but also strengthen your leg muscles. Athletes can try using orthotic shoe inserts or arch supports. These help realign your feet and absorb shock. Ask your doctor for suggestions.","Begin treatment right away if you have symptoms of shin splints. This can help reduce long-term damage. It can take several weeks or months for shin splints to heal. Once the pain is gone, you can gradually return to your normal routine. Start slow to prevent reinjuring yourself. Talk to your doctor if you have chronic (ongoing) shin splints.","• How do I know if I have shin splints or another lower leg injury?

387,Shingles,https://familydoctor.org/condition/shingles/,"Shingles is a painful skin rash. It is also called zoster or herpes zoster. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus. This is the same virus that causes chickenpox. Nearly one-third of people in the United States will get shingles in their lifetime. Most people will only get it once. But some people can have more than one episode.

The virus that causes shingles is not the same virus that causes oral or genital herpes. That virus is called the herpes simplex virus. The two are in the same family of viruses.","Shingles usually causes a painful, blistering rash. Sometimes pain, itching, or tingling start a few days before the rash appears. The rash begins with reddish bumps. In a few days, these bumps turn into fluid-filled blisters. You might feel a stinging or burning pain. The rash might also itch. Other shingles symptoms include:

• Fever
• Chills
• Nausea
• Diarrhea
• Headache

Shingles occurs most often on the trunk of the body. It also occurs on only one side of the body. This could be a band of blisters around your back or chest. The blisters usually scab over in about a week. The rash usually clears up in 2 to 4 weeks. You may see changes in the color of your skin when the scabs fall off. In more severe cases of shingles, these color changes could be permanent.

Even though the rash from shingles gets better or goes away in a few weeks, the pain may last longer. This condition is known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). In most people, however, the pain of shingles goes away in 1 to 2 months.","Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you’ve had chickenpox, the virus goes dormant (inactive) in your body. It stays inside certain nerve cells. Your immune system keeps the virus in these cells. As you get older, your immune system may get weaker. If this happens, the virus may reactivate, causing shingles. Many times this happens years after you’ve had chickenpox. If you have had the chickenpox vaccine, you are less likely to get chickenpox. Therefore, you’re less likely to later develop shingles.

Most people who get shingles are over 50 years of age or have a weak immune system. For example, you might get shingles if you:

• Have cancer
• Take medicines that weaken your immune system
• Have HIV or AIDS","Your doctor will ask you about your medical history, including if you’ve ever had chickenpox. He or she will also ask about your symptoms. They will do a physical exam and inspect your rash. There is a test that can confirm shingles, but it is not normally needed.","The best way to prevent shingles is through vaccination. Vaccinate your children for chickenpox. This vaccine reduces their risk for getting chickenpox. You can’t get shingles unless you’ve had chickenpox first.

When you are older, get the shingles vaccine. It is recommended for adults 50 years of age and older. It can prevent shingles. People who have had shingles should get the vaccine to help stop the disease from reoccurring. Common side effects of the vaccine are headache, plus redness, swelling, itching, and soreness at the injection site.

The shingles vaccine is not recommended for anyone who:

• Has had an allergic reaction to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin
• Has an allergy to any component of the shingles vaccine
• Has a weakened immune system due to conditions such as leukemia, HIV, or AIDS
• Is receiving treatment for cancer
• Is being treated with drugs that suppress their immune system, including high-dose steroids
• Is pregnant or might become pregnant within 4 weeks of getting the vaccine","Shingles is often treated with an antiviral medicine. These medicines can reduce the severity and duration of your shingles symptoms. Acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir are commonly prescribed. Your doctor will decide whether one of these medicines is right for you. These medicines work better if you start taking them in the first 3 days after you get the rash.

Your doctor might also have you take a steroid medicine to reduce your pain and swelling. This medicine along with the antiviral medicines may reduce your risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia.","Most people will only get shingles once in their life. The pain and the rash resolve in 3 to 5 weeks, and the blisters don’t leave scars. There are a few complications that can occur.

The most common complication of shingles is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). This is when the pain of shingles lasts for a long time after the rash is gone. About 10% of people who have shingles will develop PHN. It is caused by damaged nerve fibers that send exaggerated pain messages from your skin to your brain. The older you are, the more likely you are to develop PHN. It is also likely to be more severe when you are older.

Shingles can also lead to an eye condition called herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). HZO can cause a rash with small blisters to break out on the forehead and around the eye. Usually this happens only on one side of your face. Sometimes you will have pain in the same area of your face a few days before the outbreak. Infection of the eye causes extreme pain, swelling of the eyelid, light sensitivity and redness. In severe cases, the cornea can be damaged. This can affect your vision.

People who have HZO should see an eye doctor right away.","• I’ve had chickenpox. Am I at risk of developing shingles?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","No one can catch shingles from you. But the virus can be spread to a person who has never had chickenpox. The virus lives in the blisters that shingles causes. It can be spread until the blisters are completely healed. If you have blisters that have not crusted over yet, you should stay away from:

• Anyone who has never had chickenpox
• Babies under 12 months old
• Pregnant women
• Very sick people (such as those with cancer or AIDS)

Tell your doctor if you live with children who have not had chickenpox. They may need to be vaccinated.

To help with the pain of shingles symptoms, your doctor might have you take an over-the-counter pain medicine. This could include acetaminophen (one brand: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (two brands: Motrin, Advil).

Applying a medicated anti-itch lotion (two brands: Benadryl, Caladryl) to the blisters might reduce the pain and itching. Placing cool compresses soaked in water mixed with white vinegar on the blisters and sores might also help.

If shingles causes severe pain, your doctor might prescribe a stronger pain medicine."
388,Shortness of Breath,https://familydoctor.org/condition/shortness-of-breath/,"Shortness of breath is the feeling that you cannot get enough air into your lungs. It can signal an underlying health problem. Sometimes the feeling is worse when you are physically active or when you lie down flat. You may have other symptoms such as a cough or a fever.

If you are experiencing any of these problems, tell your doctor. If your shortness of breath is sudden or severe, or if you also have chest pains, you should call 911.","When you have shortness of breath, you feel as though you can’t catch your breath. You feel as though you can’t get enough air in your lungs or breathe deeply. You may also feel a tightness in your chest.","Shortness of breath can be caused by many things, including:

• Asthma
• Other lung diseases (including emphysema, which is a lung disease that is most often caused by smoking)
• Heart failure
• Panic attacks
• Allergies

If you are short of breath with a cough and/or fever, you may have a chest infection or pneumonia. Less common causes of breathing problems are lung cancer, a blood clot in the lungs, air leakage around the lungs, and scarring of the lung tissue.","Your doctor can help find the cause of your breathing problem. They will begin by asking you questions about your symptoms and performing a physical exam. Your doctor also may order some tests.

To find the cause of your shortness of breath, your doctor may order a chest X-ray. They will also measure the oxygen saturation of your body by placing an oximeter on your finger.

They may also order an electrocardiogram (also called an ECG). During this test, your doctor will have you lie down so your heart can be monitored. The ECG machine creates a picture, or tracing, that shows your heart’s electrical signals.

You may need to have a computerized tomography (CT) scan, which is another type of X-ray. Your doctor may measure the strength of your breathing (called a spirometer) and the oxygen level in your blood. You also may need to have a blood test or specialized lung test called pulmonary function test (PFT).","Whether you can prevent shortness of breath depends on what is causing it. If it is caused by allergies, you may be able to prevent it by identifying your allergy trigger. Once you know what triggers your allergies, you can do your best to avoid it. If your shortness of breath is caused by smoking, stopping can help prevent it. Other causes may not be as easy to avoid. If it is caused by a medical condition such as asthma, inhalers can help.","Your doctor will treat the cause of your breathing problem. To help your treatment, if you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your doctor for help. Also, avoid breathing chemicals that can bother your lungs, such as fumes from paint and car exhaust. If your doctor says it’s okay, you should try to get plenty of exercise.","It can be scary to have frequent shortness of breath. It can be less scary if you learn to control it. Work with your doctor on a customized control plan. Your doctor may suggest medication, an exercise program, breathing techniques, or a combination of these. In some cases, he or she may recommend supplemental oxygen.","• What is the likely cause of my shortness of breath?

389,Shoulder Instability,https://familydoctor.org/condition/shoulder-instability/,"Shoulder instability is the term doctors use when your shoulder is slightly out of place or feels like it is. In this case, “instability” means the shoulder joint isn’t stable. This means the bones aren’t held together as tightly as they should be. This is different from shoulder dislocation. That is when the shoulder is completely out of place. In this case, shoulder ligaments are torn and cannot hold the joint in place.","Pain and weakness are the main symptoms of shoulder instability. The pain can start suddenly or slowly. It may hit you just as you throw a ball, for example. If it happens suddenly, you may also feel numb all the way down your arm.

If shoulder instability comes on slowly and over time, it may only be painful at certain times. Shoulder motions like throwing may hurt. But the pain isn’t as bad as the pain of a sudden injury. Your shoulder might be sore when you move it. It might feel loose in its joint. You also may have numbness or tingling with instability that comes on slowly.","The most common cause of shoulder instability is an injury. Shoulder instability occurs when the ligaments and muscles are overused. Shoulder muscles and ligaments can become overused if you often throw a ball, hit hard with your shoulder in a football game, or serve a volleyball really hard. Repeating the same motion over and over again, age, and performing manual labor also can cause shoulder instability.","Your doctor will look at your shoulder. They will move your arm around to find signs of instability. Your doctor may also take X-rays. The X-rays will show if your shoulder bones are in the right place. Your doctor might want you to have a magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan. An MRI lets your doctor see the bones, ligaments, and other parts of your shoulder in greater detail.","There’s no way to prevent shoulder instability. But you can reduce the chances of it occurring by protecting yourself from a sports-related injury. If your job involves repeat motions or manual labor, find ways to give your muscles a rest.","Treatment for shoulder instability depends on how bad your injury is and how important it is for you to have a strong shoulder. Some people need physical therapy. After an injury, apply ice to the injured area and rest the shoulder in a sling for one or two weeks. After resting the shoulder for several days, it’s important to begin an exercise program designed to strengthen your shoulder muscles. Avoid overuse for the next month.","If your shoulder instability is due to your job, talk to your doctor about ways to treat the pain with over-the-counter medicine. If it’s sports-related, some people stop playing sports and avoid things that might hurt their shoulder again. If you don’t want to give up sports or can’t change your job, talk to your doctor about resistance and weight-lifting exercises. Ask about physical therapy. Both can help strengthen your shoulder muscles.","• What is the likely cause of my shoulder instability?

390,Sick Sinus Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sick-sinus-syndrome/,"Sick sinus syndrome is the name for several conditions in which the sinus node in your heart doesn’t work the correct way. The sinus node (also called the sinoatrial node) is a natural pacemaker in your heart that helps your heart beat steadily. An electric current starts in one of the upper chambers (called the atria) of the heart and goes through the heart to the bottom chambers (called the ventricles). The sinus node can increase your heart rate during times of high demand, such as during exercise. If you have sick sinus syndrome, your heart rate may be too slow or too fast to meet the needs of your body.

About 1 in 600 people with heart problems have sick sinus syndrome. It can happen to people of any age. Women are affected about as often as men.","Some people with sick sinus syndrome don’t feel ill or have only mild feelings of illness. Other people have symptoms that come and go. The following are some possible symptoms of sick sinus syndrome:

• Feeling like you are going to pass out
• Feeling like your heart is skipping beats or beating too fast or too slow
• Feeling dizzy
• Having chest pain
• Being short of breath
• Having difficulty thinking or remembering things
• Feeling tired","Sick sinus syndrome sometimes can be caused by other heart conditions. It also may be caused because of advanced age. In many cases, however, the cause is unknown.","Other medical problems can cause the same symptoms as sick sinus syndrome. Your doctor may order lab tests to help determine why you’re having your symptoms. These labs can be helpful in ruling out other causes for your symptoms. Your doctor will likely also order some tests that check your heart. One of these tests is electrocardiography (also called ECG). During this test, your doctor will have you lie down so your heart can be monitored. The ECG machine makes a picture (or tracing) that shows your heart’s electrical signals. Your doctor may also have you wear a special monitor, called a Holter monitor, for a few days to keep track of your heart’s electrical signals.","Do what you can to keep your heart healthy. Eat a nutritious diet. Exercise regularly if your doctor says you can. Don’t smoke. Limit alcohol. These things may help you prevent heart disease. However, sick sinus syndrome isn’t preventable in all cases.","Most people who have sick sinus syndrome will need to have an artificial pacemaker put into their body. A pacemaker is a small electronic device that’s put under the skin on your chest. It helps your heart keep a regular beat, especially when your heart beats too slowly.

If you have a pacemaker and your heart rate is too fast, your doctor may prescribe medicine to control it. In addition, your doctor may want to change some of your other medicines because some medicines can make sick sinus syndrome worse.","Sick sinus syndrome usually gets worse with time. People with sick sinus syndrome have a higher chance of getting other heart-related conditions. These include atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat), heart failure, and cardiac arrest. Some people with sick sinus syndrome may have a greater risk of having a stroke. These people might be prescribed a blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin.","• What is the likely cause of my symptoms?

391,Sickle Cell Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sickle-cell-disease/,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition you have at birth. It runs in families and is more common in Blacks or African Americans.

SCD refers to a group of red blood cell disorders. Normal red blood cells are round and flexible. They contain hemoglobin (a protein), which carries oxygen in your blood. With SCD, some red blood cells are misshapen and look like sickles (a C-shaped farm tool). These sickle cells become hard and sticky. They can get stuck—or even burst and die—when traveling through small blood vessels. This slows or blocks blood and oxygen to parts of your body. Sickle cells also contain an abnormal type of hemoglobin. This can also result in cells dying.

There are several forms of SCD. They vary based on the sickle cell and hemoglobin genes you inherit from your parents. HbSS is the most common form. It is known as sickle cell anemia. It also is the most severe form of SCD. People who have HbSS get 2 sickle cell genes, 1 from each parent.

Another form of SCD is sickle cell trait. People who have this get 1 sickle cell gene from a parent and 1 normal gene from the other parent. Typically, they don’t have SCD symptoms. However, they can pass the sickle cell gene on to their kids.","Anemia is a common symptom of SCD. It occurs because your body has a hard time creating enough new cells to replace the ones that die early. Side effects of anemia include:

• Fatigue
• Headaches
• Dizziness
• Shortness of breath
• Coldness in your hands and feet

Other symptoms of SCD include:

• Jaundice (the yellowing of skin and whites of your eyes)
• Swollen hands and feet
• Severe chronic pain
• Severe infections
• Organ damage",SCD is a condition you inherit from your parents at birth.,"SCD is diagnosed with a simple blood test. It often is included in routine newborn screening tests at birth in the hospital. It’s important to test babies for SCD. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent and manage symptoms of SCD.

Talk to your doctor if you or your partner has SCD or if it runs in your family. If you’re trying to get pregnant, your doctor can tell you options for genetic counseling. If you have SCD and are pregnant, you should receive extra care to monitor your SCD and treat problems early. Your baby can be tested for SCD during pregnancy.",SCD can’t be prevented since it’s genetic.,"Treatment for SCD varies for each person. It’s based on your form of SCD, your symptoms, and your overall health. Most treatment options aim to reduce symptoms and prevent complications.

Pain crises are a common symptom of SCD. These painful attacks occur quickly. They can last for a few hours to a few days. They happen when sickle cells get stuck in your blood vessels. This reduces the oxygen that gets to your tissues. You may feel pain in your back, knees, legs, arms, chest, or stomach. Crises are hard to predict. However, there are things you can do to help prevent them.

• Visit the doctor for regular check-ups.
• Don’t smoke. If you do smoke, quit. Your doctor can help with patches, pills, and support.
• Eat a balanced diet.
• Limit how much alcohol you drink.
• Exercise regularly. Drink a lot of fluids when you exercise to prevent dehydration. Drink at least eight glasses of water a day, especially in warm weather.
• Wash your hands regularly to prevent infection and illness.
• Reduce stress. Talk to your doctor if you’re depressed or have problems at home or work.
• Contact your doctor if you have a fever or possible infection. Illnesses should be treated as soon as possible.
• Try not to get too hot, cold, or tired. Dress properly for the weather. Get rest when needed.
• Tell your doctor if you think you have a sleep problem, such as snoring or sleep apnea. This is when you stop breathing for short periods of time while you sleep.
• Manage other health issues you have, such as diabetes. Talk to your doctor if you’re pregnant or plan to become pregnant. They can tell you about genetic counseling and get you started with prenatal care early on.
• Only travel in commercial airplanes. If you have to travel in an unpressurized aircraft, talk to your doctor about extra precautions.

New treatment options have been introduced in recent years. These include bone marrow and stem cell transplants. These two treatments can cure SCD when successful. Transplants require a donor and are risky. They typically only are approved for severe cases. They involve taking bone marrow or stem cells from the donor and implanting them into your body. Transplants have a lot of side effects and can result in death when not successful.","SCD is a life-long condition. For most people, there is no cure. A managed lifestyle is the best way to reduce symptoms and complications and prolong life.","• Are there medicines I can take to treat SCD?

392,Silent Heart Attacks,https://familydoctor.org/condition/silent-heart-attacks/,A silent heart attack is a heart attack without the traditional symptoms. You often don’t know you are having a silent heart attack. Many people don’t find out until weeks or months later. Recent research suggests that nearly half of all heart attacks are silent heart attacks.,"The symptoms of a silent heart attack are not as severe as those for a regular heart attack. They can often be mistaken for other conditions. Some people feel no symptoms at all. Pay attention when you feel any of the following:

• Discomfort –You may still feel pain, but it won’t be the unmistakable chest pain of a regular heart attack. You may feel discomfort in the upper abdomen, in your back, or in your jaw. It could feel like you’ve strained a muscle.
• Shortness of breath –If you are feeling short of breath or having trouble breathing doing small activities, it could be a sign of a heart attack.
• Heartburn –Mild pain in the throat or chest can be mistaken for gastric reflux, indigestion, or heartburn.
• Fatigue –Physical discomfort or feeling very tired can be signs of many things. When they happen with a silent heart attack, they are often mistaken for other things. These could include poor sleep or age-related aches and pains.
• Feeling lightheaded –If you break out in a cold sweat, feel nauseated, or feel lightheaded, you could be having a silent heart attack.

If you experience one or more of these symptoms, call your doctor right away, go to the emergency room, or call 911.","Silent heart attacks are caused by the same things that cause traditional heart attacks. This happens when part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies because it hasn’t received enough oxygen. This is often due to a blocked artery in the heart. Risk factors for silent heart attacks are also the same. They include:

• Smoking
• Diabetes
• Age (risk increases for men older than 45 and for women older than 55 [or after menopause])
• High cholesterol
• High blood pressure
• Family history of heart attack
• Race (Black people, Native Americans, and native Hawaiians are at greater risk)
• Lack of exercise
• Stress
• Obesity
• Gender (women have silent heart attacks more often than men)","Many times, silent heart attacks are found during a routine check-up. If your doctor thinks you may have had one, they may order imaging tests. These could include an echocardiogram or echo, which is a special ultrasound, or a CT scan or MRI of your heart.

These tests can show if your heart muscle has been damaged, signaling that you’ve had a heart attack. If you’ve gone to the emergency room with silent heart attack symptoms, the doctor may order blood tests.","A healthy lifestyle can help prevent any kind of heart attack. This includes:

• Quitting smoking or vaping and avoiding secondhand smoke
• Decreasing alcohol consumption
• Keeping a healthy diet that is low in fat and low in cholesterol
• Exercising regularly
• Managing your stress
• Controlling your blood pressure
• Managing your blood sugar level if you have diabetes
• Seeing your doctor regularly for check-ups","Normally, silent heart attacks are found long after the heart attack is over. Treatment will mostly involve taking medicines. These medicines help improve blood flow to your heart, prevent clotting, and reduce the risks of having another heart attack. They include:

• Aspirin
• Beta blockers
• Statins
• ACE inhibitors
• Fish oil

Your doctor will prescribe the medicines that are right for you. If you have had a heart attack, your doctor will also talk to you about lifestyle changes. You can make these changes to prevent more heart problems.","After you’ve had a silent heart attack, you are at higher risk of having another one. This one will likely be more severe and harmful. Your doctor will likely recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help reduce your risk. They include:

• A heart-healthy diet
• Working toward a healthy weight
• Managing stress
• Being physically active
• Quitting smoking

Symptoms during a second heart attack may be different than the first one. If you have any new symptoms of a heart attack or are in any doubt, call 911. Early treatment is the key to surviving a heart attack.","• I feel discomfort in my chest. Could I be having a silent heart attack?
• How much risk do I have for having a silent heart attack?
• How serious was my heart attack?
• What happens now?
• Will I have to take medicine for the rest of my life?
• What is my risk of having another heart attack? Will it be more harmful than the first one?
• What lifestyle changes can I make to prevent another heart attack?","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Heart Attack

393,Sinus Infection (Sinusitis),https://familydoctor.org/condition/sinusitis/,"A sinus infection is a condition in which the lining of your sinuses becomes inflamed. It is caused by bacteria or a virus. When your sinuses are inflamed or swollen for other reasons, it is called sinusitis.

Four hollow air spaces make up your sinuses. They’re located in the bones behind your cheeks, jaw, and eyebrows. Your sinuses make mucus, a fluid that cleans bacteria and other particles out of the air you breathe. Mucus is removed from your sinuses by draining out your nose. But when your sinuses are swollen, the mucus has nowhere to go. It stays in your sinuses and become painful and uncomfortable.

There are four main types of sinus infections:

• Acute infections last up to 4 weeks.
• Subacute infections can last 4 to 12 weeks.
• Chronic sinus infections last more than 12 weeks.
• Recurrent sinus infections happen several times a year.","The symptoms of a sinus infection include:

• Pain or pressure in your cheeks, forehead, nose and ears, or between your eyes
• Headache
• Nasal congestion
• Fever
• Coughing, which may be worse at night
• Drainage down the back of your throat
• Reduced sense of smell and taste
• Weakness or fatigue
• Toothache
• Bad breath (called halitosis)","When bacteria or a virus causes sinusitis, it’s called a sinus infection. This can occur after you’ve had a cold. The virus attacks the lining of your sinuses, causing it to swell and narrow. Your body responds by producing more mucus, but it gets blocked in your sinuses. This buildup is a good place for bacteria to grow.

Other causes for sinusitis can include:

• Allergies
• Certain conditions, such as a deviated septum
• Growths called polyps that block your sinus passages",Your doctor can diagnose a sinus infection. They will do an exam and review your symptoms. Your doctor also may check your mucus or order an imaging test to confirm it.,"Sinus infections can’t be prevented. Certain factors increase your risk of getting an infection. These include:

• Having a cold or allergies
• Using decongestant nasal sprays too much
• Smoking
• Swimming or diving
• A weak immune system or taking drugs that weaken the immune system

However, there are some things you can do to try to keep yourself healthy:

• If you smoke, stop. Avoid second-hand smoke, if possible.
• Wash your hands frequently.
• Don’t touch your face, especially your mouth, nose, and eyes.
• If possible, stay away from things you know will trigger your allergies.","There are several treatment options for sinusitis that is not caused by an infection. They vary depending on the cause of your condition.

You can use a saline nasal spray. This will clean out your nasal passages and help clear congestion. Your doctor may suggest a decongestant nasal spray to treat swelling. Don’t use this for more than 3 days. It can worsen the swelling in your sinuses once you stop using the medicine.

A process called nasal irrigation can provide relief. A saline solution through a device called a neti pot (which looks like a small teapot with a long spout) can flush out your sinuses and help loosen thick mucus. It’s important to use distilled or sterile water or tap water that has been boiled for 3 to 5 minutes and cooled. Regular tap water isn’t safe to use because it hasn’t been properly filtered or treated to be safe in the sinuses. Some tap water contains organisms that can cause serious infections in your nasal passages.

Decongestant medicines relieve sinus pain and pressure. In general, you should only use them short-term. Over-the-counter pain relievers can relieve aches and fever as well. Talk with your doctor before using any over-the-counter cold medicine. Some can make your symptoms worse or have other side effects.

Your doctor can also prescribe allergy medicine to treat conditions caused by allergies.

Severe sinus infections caused by bacteria may require an antibiotic. Your doctor will instruct you to take this for 5 to 10 days. However, you often will start to feel better after taking it a few days. Make sure you finish all the medicine your doctor prescribes.","A sinus infection often goes away even without treatment. There are things you can do at home to help yourself feel better.

• Get plenty of rest. Lying on your back can make your sinuses feel more blocked. Try lying on your side instead. This helps you breathe better. Or you can try propping yourself up with a pillow.
• Drink plenty of fluids. Sipping hot liquids can help soothe your throat.
• Apply heat. Try holding a warm, wet towel against your face. Or you can breathe in steam through a hot cloth or towel or the steam from a hot shower. This can relieve sinus pressure and help open your sinus passages.
• Avoid alcohol. It can worsen the swelling in your sinuses.

• Have a fever that lasts more than a 3-4 days
• Still have symptoms after 10 days with no improvement
• Symptoms that get worse after improving
• Get sinus infections several times in one year","• What medicine should I take to treat a sinus infection?

The simple answer is no, a sinus infection is not contagious. However, if a cold or virus caused your sinus infection, those are contagious."
394,Sjögren’s Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sjogrens-syndrome/,"Sjögren’s (pronounced “show-grins”) syndrome is a disease that causes dry mouth and dry eyes. It can also cause dryness in other places that need moisture. This includes the nose, throat, or skin. It is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks your body by mistake. In Sjogren’s syndrome, the immune system attacks the glands that make tears and saliva (spit). The damage keeps the glands from working properly.","The most common symptom of Sjögren’s syndrome is severe dryness in the eyes and mouth. This lasts for at least 3 months and isn’t caused by any medicines you are taking.

• Dry eyes: Your eyes may feel gritty and itchy. You could have blurry vision or be sensitive to bright light.
• Dry mouth: Your mouth could feel like it’s full of cotton. You may have trouble swallowing, eating dry foods, or even speaking.

In more severe cases of Sjögren’s syndrome, other parts of your body may be affected by the condition. These could include:

• joints
• lungs
• kidneys
• blood vessels
• digestive organs
• nerves

Symptoms in these areas include:

• Dry skin.
• Skin rashes.
• Chronic dry cough.
• Joint and muscle pain.
• Fatigue or feeling very tired.
• Vaginal dryness.
• Numbness and tingling in the arms and legs.","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes Sjögren’s syndrome. It usually affects women over age 40. It is 9 times more common in women than in men. Sjögren’s syndrome may develop in people who have other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto’s disease, or lupus. Research shows that genetic factors could make a person more likely to develop the disease.",null,There is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid getting Sjögren’s syndrome.,"There is no cure for Sjögren’s syndrome. Treatment involves easing the symptoms that the disease causes. Over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription eye drops can help with dry eyes. In more severe cases, the tear ducts that drain tears from your eyes can be plugged or blocked. To treat dry mouth, you can drink water, chew gum, or use saliva substitutes. If necessary, your doctor can prescribe medicines that will help your body make more tears and saliva. These treatments can help relieve some of the dryness. But usually it doesn’t go away completely.

If you have joint pain associated with Sjögren’s syndrome, your doctor may recommend taking an OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin). This medicine can help relieve the pain and swelling in your joints.

Depending on your symptoms and whether you have organ damage from Sjögren’s syndrome, your doctor may prescribe other medicines and treatments.","Currently, there is not a cure for Sjögren’s syndrome. However, in most cases, treatment can help relieve your symptoms and prevent complications. The majority of people with Sjögren’s syndrome are healthy and don’t have serious complications from the disease.

People with the disease do have more risk of having some problems because of the long-term decrease in tears and saliva. These include infections in or around the eyes and dental problems such as cavities. Make sure you are taking good care of your teeth and see your dentist regularly. If you notice any pain or redness in your eyes, get it looked at right away. These could be signs of an infection.

Rare complications of Sjögren’s syndrome include lung problems, liver or kidney problems, skin rashes, weakness and numbness, or lymphoma.","• How did I get Sjögren’s syndrome?

395,Skin Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/skin-cancer/,"Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Almost all skin cancers are the result of too much exposure to ultraviolet light. This is found in sunlight, tanning booths, and sunlamps. Skin cancer is usually one of the most curable types of cancer, especially when patients participate in regular screenings.

Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are two of the most common forms of skin cancer. They are very curable. These cancers occur in the basal and squamous cell layers at the top of the skin. They are almost always slow-growing. If found early, they are easy to treat and do not spread.

Melanoma is a less common but aggressive form of skin cancer. It occurs in skin cells that make a skin color pigment called melanin. If it is not found early, it will likely spread to other tissues. It can spread through the whole body and may cause death. Only 2% of skin cancer cases are melanoma. But it causes the most deaths from skin cancer.","The main symptom of skin cancer is a new or changing bump, growth, lesion, mole, or rough patch of skin. Not all skin cancers look alike.

A normal mole is solid tan, brown, dark brown, or flesh colored. Its edges are well defined. It’s usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter (not bigger than a pencil eraser). It has a round or oval shape. It is flat or dome-like.

The ABCDE rule can help you remember what to look for when you’re checking for moles. If you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor right away.

• A for asymmetry – Mole is not symmetrical. This means it’s not the same on both sides. If it was folded in half, the two halves wouldn’t match.
• B for border – Edges of the mole are blurry or jagged
• C for color – Changes in the color of a mole. This could be darkening, loss of color, spreading color, or multiple colors.
• D for diameter – A mole more than ¼ inch in diameter
• E for evolving – Mole looks different from others or is changing in shape, size, or color

Other signs of cancer could include:

• A mole that itches or bleeds
• A fast-growing mole
• A scaly or crusted growth on the skin
• A sore that won’t heal
• A patch of skin that has changed color

Most skin cancers occur on parts of the body that are repeatedly exposed to the sun. For men, these areas include the head, neck, face, tips of the ears, hands, forearms, shoulders, back, and chests. For women, they occur most commonly on the back and the lower legs.

Melanomas can be anywhere on your body. In men, they are most often on the chest, stomach, or back. In women, they are most often on the lower legs.

Moles also can grow in hidden areas of your body. This includes between toes, on your scalp, or under a nail. If you notice a mole that has changed, or if you have a new mole that doesn’t look like your other moles, see your family doctor right away.","Most cases of skin cancer are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This comes from the sun, tanning beds, and sunlamps. There are 2 types of UV rays:

• UVA rays (long-wave) – UVA rays penetrate clouds and glass. They penetrate the skin more deeply and damage the basal layer of the skin.
• UVB rays (short-wave) – UVB rays damage the upper layers of the skin. They are the main cause of tanning and sunburn.

Researchers used to believe that only UVB rays led to cancer. But studies have shown that both UVA and UVB damage the skin and can cause cancer.

A tan is the body’s attempt to protect itself from the sun’s harmful rays. Even if you don’t burn, being in the sun too often for too long can lead to skin cancer. Tanning booths are just as dangerous as long periods of sunlight.

Some people are more at risk of developing skin cancer. Things that could increase your risk include:

• Having fair skin, blonde or red hair, and light-colored eyes
• Long-term sun exposure, such as working outside
• A history of bad sunburns, especially as a child or teenager
• Using indoor tanning beds
• Having a weakened immune system, including having an organ transplant

Melanoma can occur anywhere on your body. This includes places that aren’t exposed to the sun. There could be other factors that can cause it. Risk factors for developing melanoma include:

• Someone in your family has had cancerous moles or a melanoma
• You have many moles larger than a pencil eraser
• You have more than 50 moles of any size
• You got a bad sunburn that caused blisters when you were a child
• Your skin usually burns but doesn’t tan

Certain medications are also associated with increased risk of skin cancer. One example is hydrochlorothiazide, a common blood pressure medication.","The first step to diagnosing skin cancer is usually through regular self-examination. Use a full-length mirror and a handheld mirror to check every inch of your skin.

• Learn where your birthmarks, moles, and blemishes are and what they usually look like. Check for anything new, such as a change in the size, texture, or color of a mole, or a sore that doesn’t heal.
• Look at the front and back of your body in the mirror. Raise your arms and look at your left and right sides.
• Bend your elbows and look carefully at your palms and forearms, including the undersides, and your upper arms.
• Check the back and front of your legs.
• Look between your buttocks and around your genital area.
• Sit and closely examine your feet, including the bottoms of your feet and the spaces between your toes.
• Look at your face, neck, and scalp. You may want to use a comb or a blow dryer to move hair so you can see better.

By checking yourself regularly, you are familiar with what’s normal for your skin. If you find anything unusual, see your family doctor. The earlier skin cancer is found, the better.

Your doctor will examine your skin. They will look at the size, shape, color, and texture of any concerning areas. If you have skin changes that might be skin cancer, your doctor will do a biopsy. During a biopsy, a small piece of your skin is removed and sent to the lab for testing.

If skin cancer is diagnosed, you may undergo more tests to see if the cancer cells have spread. These tests could include a CT scan, MRI, or lymph node biopsy.","The key to preventing skin cancer is to avoid being in the sun or using sunlamps. If you’re going to be in the sun for any length of time, follow safe-sun guidelines. These are ways to protect your skin and reduce your risk of skin cancer. For the best protection, follow all of these guidelines every time you’re outside.

• Avoid the sun. Avoid being in the sun in the middle of the day, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. The sun is the strongest during these hours. That’s when the most damage to your skin occurs. Sunburns and suntans are signs that your skin is damaged. The more damage, the more likely you are to have complications. These include early wrinkles, skin cancer, or other skin problems.
• Use sunscreen. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Use it on cloudy days, too. Check the expiration date. Some ingredients break down over time. Use plenty of sunscreen. Rub it in well. Apply sunscreen at least 15 minutes before you go into the sun. Apply the sunscreen everywhere your skin is exposed. This includes your ears, the back of your neck, and any bald areas on the top of the head. Apply more sunscreen at least every 2 hours and after swimming, sweating, or toweling off.

Remember, you’re not completely safe just because you’re wearing sunscreen. Sunscreen cannot give you 100% protection against the sun’s harmful UV radiation.

• Wear a wide-brimmed hat, protective clothing, and sunglasses. If you have to be out in the sun, cover up your skin. A wide-brimmed hat will help protect your face, neck, and ears. A hat with a 6-inch brim all around is the best. Baseball caps don’t protect the back of your neck or the tops of your ears.

Wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants made of tightly woven fabric. If the clothes fit loosely, you will feel cooler. Special sun-protective clothes are available from several companies.

Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes. Sun exposure increases your risk of getting cataracts. Choose sunglasses that protect the sides of your eyes and block both UVA and UVB rays.

Remember that you are exposed to the sun while driving, especially your hands and arms. Clouds and water don’t protect you. UV rays can reach swimmers at least 1 foot below the surface of the water, and 60% to 80% of the sun’s rays go through clouds. The sun’s rays also can reflect off water, snow, white sand, and concrete.

• Don’t try to get a tan. Don’t use tanning beds or sunlamps. They damage your skin just like natural sunlight does.
• Protect your kids. Sunburns in childhood are the most damaging. Children younger than 6 months of age should never be outside in direct sunshine. Children 6 months of age or older should wear sunscreen every day. Getting numerous bad sunburns as a child increases your risk of developing skin cancer later in life.

The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) advises talking to children, teens, and young adults, who are 10 to 24 years of age, about the dangers of too much sun exposure. Teach them how to protect themselves and reduce their risk of skin cancer.","Treatment for skin cancer depends on several factors. These include the type of cancer, where it is located, how big it is, how far it has spread, and your general health. Most cases of nonmelanoma cancers can be taken care of with surgical removal of the mole or lesion. Other options include freezing, medicated creams, or laser therapy.

Treatment for melanoma is more complex. When caught early, the cancerous tissue can be removed with surgery. If it has spread beyond the skin, treatments could include:

• Radiation – High-energy rays like X-rays shrink or kill the cancerous cells.
• Chemotherapy – Powerful medicines, in pill form or injected into the veins, shrink, or kill the cancer.
• Biological therapy – Uses substances produced by living organisms. These can be made in the body or in a lab. They are used to boost your immune system to help your body fight the cancer. Some may suppress your immune system. This means you could more easily get sick.
• Targeted therapy – Uses medicines that are designed to target specific weak spots in cancer cells.","Skin cancer is treatable, especially when caught early. Cancerous tissue can be removed with a minor surgical procedure. In many cases, that is all the treatment needed. Future lesions may occur. You will need to continue checking your skin. Call your doctor if you see changes.

For more advanced cases, living with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Each treatment can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying active.

Even after your cancer goes into remission, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.","• What should I look for when I do a self-examination of my skin?

396,Skin tags,https://familydoctor.org/condition/skin-tags/,"If you’ve found a small, soft bump of skin hanging from your neck, armpit, or other body area, you may be wondering: what are skin tags? These harmless growths are very common and usually don’t cause pain or medical problems. However, understanding what causes them—and when to see a doctor—can help you feel more at ease.

A skin tag is a growth that can occur anywhere on your body. It is benign, which means it is not cancer. Both men and women can get them.","No one knows exactly what causes skin tags. They might occur from skin rubbing on skin. Skin tags are more common with age and can run in families. They also are common in people who have diabetes or are overweight.

A skin tag looks and feels like a hanging mole. It is usually a lighter color than a mole and may be similar to your skin color. They are commonly located on the neck, underarms, middle of the body, in folds of skin, eyelids, and inner thighs. They can appear anywhere on your body. Skin tags usually don’t continue to grow or change color. They are often painless, but may hurt if they are irritated by clothes, jewelry, or skin rubbing together.",null,"Your doctor can diagnose skin tags by looking at them during an exam. See your doctor if you skin tag that has changed color or grown.

Sometimes skin tags fall off on their own as they get pulled and irritated. When this happens, they dry out, which makes them fall off. If they bother you, your doctor can remove them by:

• Cutting them off
• Freezing them off
• Burning them off with a special device

A skin tag can be removed in the doctor’s office. Generally, they don’t grow back in the same place. However, new ones can pop up in new places.","No, they cannot be prevented or avoided.",null,"Living with skin tags is more of an annoyance.

397,Sleep Apnea,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sleep-apnea/,"Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder. People who have sleep apnea stop breathing for 10 to 30 seconds at a time while they are sleeping. These short stops in breathing can happen up to 400 times every night. If you have sleep apnea, periods of not breathing can disturb your sleep (even if they don’t fully wake you up).

Men, people who are overweight, have endocrine disorders, neuromuscular conditions, heart or kidney failure, genetic syndromes, premature birth, and people who are older than 40 years of age are more likely to have sleep apnea. However, it can affect anyone at any age, even children.","Because some of the symptoms of sleep apnea occur while you’re sleeping, your bed partner may notice them first. You, or that person, may notice heavy snoring or long pauses in your breathing during sleep.

Even if you don’t remember waking up during the night, you may notice daytime sleepiness (such as falling asleep at work, while driving, or when talking), irritability, or fatigue. You may also experience morning headaches, forgetfulness, mood changes, and a decreased interest in sex","There are two kinds of sleep apnea: obstructive apnea and central apnea.

Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common type. Nine out of 10 people who have sleep apnea have this type of apnea. If you have obstructive apnea, something is blocking the airway that brings air into your body (also called the trachea). When you try to breathe, you can’t get enough air because of the blockage. Your airway might be blocked by your tongue, tonsils, or uvula (the little piece of flesh that hangs down in the back of your throat). It might also be blocked by a large amount of fatty tissue in the throat or by relaxed throat muscles.

Central sleep apnea is less common. This type of sleep apnea is related to the function of the central nervous system. If you have this type of apnea, the muscles you use to breathe don’t get the “go-ahead” signal from your brain. Either the brain doesn’t send the signal, or the signal gets interrupted.","Your doctor can diagnose sleep apnea. He or she may ask you if you feel tired or sleepy during the day. Your doctor may also want to know about your bedtime habits and how well you sleep. Your doctor may ask you to go to a sleep disorder center for a sleep study. Tests done at the sleep disorder center may reveal which kind of sleep apnea you have. Or, you may be able to do your sleep study at home.","There are things you can do to prevent sleep apnea. The following steps help many people:

• Stop all use of alcohol or sleep medicines. These relax the muscles in the back of your throat, making it harder for you to breathe.
• If you smoke, quit smoking.
• If you are overweight, lose weight.
• Sleep on your side instead of on your back.","Certain dental devices can be used to treat mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea. These devices move your jaw forward to make breathing easier.

A common treatment for sleep apnea is called “continuous positive airway pressure,” or CPAP. In this treatment, you wear a special mask over your nose (and sometimes mouth, too) while you are sleeping. The mask will keep your airway open by adding pressure to the air you breathe. It helps most people who have sleep apnea.

In very few cases, surgery is necessary to remove tonsils or extra tissue from the throat.","Sleep apnea can cause serious problems if it isn’t treated. Your risk of high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, glaucoma, diabetes, cancer, and cognitive and behavioral disorders is higher if you have serious sleep apnea that goes untreated. You are also more likely to have traffic accidents if you drive while you’re sleepy. If you have sleep apnea, it is very important to get treatment.","• Do I need a sleep study?

399,Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis/,"Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a hip problem. It starts if the epiphysis (growing end) of the femur (thigh bone) slips from the ball of the hip joint. SCFE may develop in one or both legs.

SCFE usually occurs in children between the ages of 8 and 15 years old. It often happens during a growth spurt. It’s also more common in children who have a family history of SCFE. More boys than girls get SCFE. It’s more common in blacks than whites. Children who have obesity have a much higher risk of getting SCFE.",There are two types of slipped capital femoral epiphysis: stable and unstable.,Doctors don’t know the exact cause of SCFE.,Your child’s doctor will talk with you and your child about their symptoms. The doctor may watch your child’s gait (how they walk). Your doctor may order X-rays of your child’s pelvis and thigh.,"If your child is severely overweight, losing weight may help reduce the chance of getting SCFE.","Once SCFE is diagnosed, treatment is needed right away. That usually means surgery. Your doctor will probably refer your child to an orthopedic surgeon. This is a doctor who fixes bone problems.

The most common surgery of SCFE is called in-situ fixation. With this treatment, the bone is held in place with a screw. This screw keeps the thigh bone from slipping and will close the growth plate. This usually works for children with stable SCFE. The results of this treatment are good, and it has few complications.

Other surgical treatments (including in-situ fixation with more than one screw) are used less often. Ask your doctor to explain the potential benefits and risks of the treatment options.","If SCFE is caught early, there is a good chance for full recovery, especially if it is stable. Research suggests that 30% to 60% of children diagnosed with SCFE will have it occur later in the other leg. This means close follow up and monitoring are important. Sometimes surgery is done to prevent this from occurring. Some children who have had SCFE may get arthritis in the hip later in life.

If your child has surgery, it will take time to get better. For 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, your child will need to use crutches to walk. Then your child can slowly get back into normal activities. They may be able to return to running and contact sports.

Complications sometimes happen with SCFE. The most serious complications are avascular necrosis (a lack of blood flow to the bone) and chondrolysis (decay of cartilage). Your doctor can explain these issues to you, if needed.","• What is the likely cause of my child’s hip problems?
• Is my child’s SCFE stable or unstable?
• Will my child need surgery?
• What risks are associated with surgery?
• How long will my child need to be on crutches?
• Will my child need physical therapy?
• Are other treatment options available?

A child who has stable SCFE may first have stiffness in the hip. The stiffness may get better with rest. After a while, the stiffness may turn into a limp. The child may have pain that comes and goes. The pain is often felt in the groin, the thigh, or the knee, and not in the hip itself.

Later, the child may lose some ability to move the involved hip. This leg will usually twist out. It may look shorter than the other leg. The child may not be able to play sports or run. Your child may also have trouble with regular tasks such as bending over to tie shoes. The symptoms may change gradually or rapidly.

A child who can’t walk, even with crutches, has unstable SCFE. Unstable SCFE often happens after a trauma, such as a sports injury or a fall. Falling can also cause a stable SCFE to become unstable.

A child who has unstable SCFE has extreme pain. The pain is similar to what might be felt with a broken bone. The child probably won’t be able to move the injured leg. If you think your child has unstable SCFE, don’t force the leg to move. That could make the thigh bone slip even more."
400,Small Vessel Disease,https://familydoctor.org/condition/small-vessel-disease/,Small vessel disease is a condition that affects the tiny arteries in your heart. It is caused when these arteries are damaged and don’t dilate properly. It is also called coronary microvascular disease. Your small vessels expand and contract to provide blood to your heart. They send more blood when you exercise or exert yourself. They send less blood when you are at rest. Small vessel disease makes blood flow more difficult.,"Angina is the most common symptom of small vessel disease. Angina feels like pain or pressure in your chest. It can make you sweat or make it hard to catch your breath. The pain can spread to your arm, neck, jaw, or shoulder. The symptom is similar to a heart attack.

Other symptoms of small vessel disease include:

• Shortness of breath
• Feeling dizzy or lightheaded
• Fatigue
• Fainting

Most people who have small vessel disease notice symptoms in their daily routine. You also can have them when you are active or stressed. If left untreated, small vessel disease forces your heart to work harder to pump blood. This puts you at risk for heart attack and heart failure.

Women are at higher risk for small vessel disease. Other risk factors include:

• Low estrogen levels
• Obesity
• High blood pressure
• High cholesterol levels
• Lack of exercise
• Diabetes
• Smoking
• Family history of heart disease","A narrowing of your heart arteries leads to small vessel disease. This can be caused by:

• Spasms in your arteries
• Damage to your artery walls
• Diseased arteries

Small vessel disease is not the same as coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD affects the large vessels in your heart. They carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart. CAD is caused by a build-up of a fatty substance (plaque) in your large vessels. When your heart lacks blood and oxygen, you can have a heart attack.","Talk to your doctor if you have any of the symptoms of small vessel disease. Small vessel disease is hard to diagnose. This is because the vessels are so tiny. Your doctor may perform tests to examine your symptoms. He or she will make sure the blockage is not in your large coronary vessels.

If you have severe chest pain that extends from your chest to your jaw or left arm, get help right away.","The best way to prevent small vessel disease is by reducing your risk factors.

• Lose weight. If you are overweight, create a weight loss plan with your doctor.
• Don’t smoke. Nicotine raises your blood pressure by causing your body to release adrenaline. It constricts your blood vessels and makes your heart beat faster. If you smoke, ask your doctor for help to quit.
• Control your blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure, your doctor can suggest ways to lower it. Take medicines to treat high blood pressure should be taken with caution, per your doctor’s orders.
• Improve your cholesterol levels. A healthy diet and exercise can balance your cholesterol levels. They lower your “bad” cholesterol (LDL) and raise your “good” cholesterol (HDL). LDL blocks your blood vessels and increases your risk of developing heart disease. Medicine also can help with this.
• Regular exercise strengthens your heart and reduces your risk of heart disease. Before you start, talk to your doctor about the right kind of exercise for you. Try to exercise at least 4 to 6 times a week for at least 30 minutes each time.
• Eat a healthy diet. Add foods to your diet that are low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Foods that are low-fat and raise your HDL levels help reduce your risk of heart disease.
• Manage diabetes. Work with your doctor to keep your blood sugar under control.","Medicine can help control the narrowing of your small blood vessels. It also can help control your symptoms, such as pain and high blood pressure. Surgery is not an option because the vessels are so small.",Your doctor will want routine check-ups to monitor how you are doing. The frequency of these check-ups will depend on the severity of your disease. Be sure to tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms. Also tell your doctor if you’ve ever had anemia. Anemia is a condition marked by low red blood cell count. It can increase your risk of heart attack.,"• If I have small vessel disease, is it safe for me to exercise?
• Will medicine to treat small vessel disease interact with medicines I already take?
• What symptoms will indicate that my condition is getting worse?
• Does small vessel disease put me at risk for any long-term problems?","American Heart Association, Coronary Microvascular Disease (MVD)

401,Social Phobia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/social-phobia/,"Social phobia, also called social anxiety disorder, is a fear of being judged by others during social situations. This includes, work, parties, family gatherings, etc. Most people feel nervous in certain social situations, such as at a job interview or when giving a speech. Most of us worry about what we’re going to say, do, or wear during events like these. These situations often become easier with some experience. However, for people who have social phobia these situations can be frightening and unbearable.

There are different levels of social phobia. For instance, some people may only have symptoms in one specific situation, such as performing on stage or speaking to a crowd. Others may have it any time they are out in public or around people.","People who have social phobia can experience internal and external symptoms.

Internal (emotional) symptoms include:

• Fear of being judged, embarrassed, or rejected
• Feeling that everyone is watching them
• Belief that anxiety is a sign of weakness
• Belief that they are stupid, and other people are smarter and more confident than them

External (physical) symptoms include:

• Withdrawal or avoidance
• Blushing
• Sweating
• Nausea or vomiting
• Trembling or shaking
• Trouble talking or making eye contact
• Increased heart rate

People who have social phobia often realize that their fears are not rational or warranted. However, they may still dread social situations. They may even go out of their way to avoid events. If they do go to an event, they usually feel nervous before the event and uncomfortable during it. Afterward, the unpleasant symptoms and feelings may linger as they worry about what people thought of them.","Social phobia is about twice as common in women as it is in men. Most people notice it as children or teens. The condition can be genetic and run in families. Other potential factors include hormones and environment. For example, race, culture, economic status, and neglect can increase a person’s risk. Social phobia also can be related to other conditions, including depression, other anxiety disorders, or addiction.","Talk to your family doctor if you have symptoms of social phobia. They will want to know about your symptoms, health history, and family history. When diagnosing the condition, the doctor will look for:

• Frequency of symptoms
• Presence of ongoing symptoms of 6 months or more
• Side effects of symptoms (for instance, do your symptoms affect your daily work, school, or social life?)
• Certain environments when the phobia occurs

Your doctor may reference the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). They may refer you to a specialist, such as a psychologist.","There is little you can do to prevent social phobia. You can get treatment to help manage, reduce, or relieve symptoms. You can learn to adjust in social situations you must participate in, such as work. Also, you can learn to adapt, such as attending a party for a shorter time.","Social phobia is an ongoing disorder that should be treated with medical care. It is real and does not usually go away on its own. Your family doctor can help you find ways to manage your symptoms. A range of treatment includes:

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This helps people think about social situations in a different way. The goal of therapy is to remove the thoughts and actions that are driving anxiety. CBT teaches you how to address fear, cope with stress, and improve social skills. Your doctor may suggest group or family therapy in addition to CBT.

Social skills training. This can teach a person some strategies for handling certain types of social situations.

Prescription medicines. Your doctor may recommend prescription medicine. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines are most common. Beta-blockers may help people who have a certain form of social phobia called “performance anxiety.” You can take them before a performance to help ease anxiety. Medicines may take a while to begin working. Do not stop taking anxiety medicine without talking to your doctor first.","Social phobia can make it hard to go to work, school, or take part in daily activities. It can affect your ability to make and keep friends. It is not a condition that you should have to deal with alone. Talk to loved ones and your doctor to begin treatment. It is common to choose a combination of therapy and medicine. Your doctor should monitor your treatment and progress.

People who have social anxiety may try to self-medicate by experimenting with and becoming dependent on the use of alcohol or illegal drugs to manage a situation. This puts them at higher risk of substance abuse.

Diet and exercise also are important in managing the symptoms of social anxiety. This includes regular exercise, a nutritious diet, and avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine and over-the-counter cold medicines.","• How do I know if I have social phobia?
• What is the likely cause of my condition?
• Is there a treatment that can help me
• How long will I have to take medicine or be in therapy?
• Is there anything I can do on my own to help manage my symptoms?","Anxiety and Depression Association of America: Social Anxiety Disorder

402,Somatic Symptom Disorder,https://familydoctor.org/condition/somatic-symptom-and-related-disorders/,"Somatic symptom and related disorders is the name for a group of conditions in which the physical pain and symptoms a person feels are related to psychological factors. Such pain and symptoms result in excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors and can interfere with a person’s ability to function and maintain relationships. These symptoms can’t be traced to a specific physical cause. In people who have a somatic symptom and related disorders, medical test results are either normal or don’t explain the person’s symptoms.

People who have this disorder may have several medical evaluations and tests to be sure that they don’t have another illness. They often become very worried about their health because they don’t know what’s causing their health problems. Their symptoms are similar to the symptoms of other illnesses and may last for several years. People who have a somatoform disorder are not faking their symptoms. The pain that they feel is real.","There are several types of somatic symptom and related disorders.

Somatization disorder usually involves pain and severe neurological symptoms (such as headache, fatigue). Other symptoms include:

• Digestive symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea)
• Sexual symptoms (such as pain during sexual activity, loss of sexual desire, and extremely painful periods in women)

Hypochondriasis occurs when a person believes that normal body functions (such as a grumbling stomach) or minor symptoms (such as a common headache) are symptoms of a very serious disorder. To a person who has hypochondriasis, a grumbling stomach may mean stomach cancer. A headache may mean a brain tumor.

Body dysmorphic disorder occurs when a person becomes obsessed with a flaw in their physical appearance. The flaw is either a minor flaw or a flaw that doesn’t exist. They constantly worry about the perceived flaw, which can be any part of the body. Common concerns for people who have body dysmorphic disorder include:

• Wrinkles
• Hair loss
• Weight gain
• Size and shape of feature like the eyes, nose, and breasts

Conversion disorder is when physical symptoms that are similar to a neurological disorder develop even though no neurological disorder is actually present. Common symptoms include:

• Paralysis of an arm or leg
• Vision loss
• Hearing loss
• Seizure

Stress may make the symptoms worse.

No one knows exactly why symptoms of somatic symptom and related disorders appear. In some cases, there may be a problem with the nerve impulses that send signals of pain, pressure, and other unpleasant sensations to the brain. We do know that the pain and problems caused by somatic symptom and related disorders are real. They are not imagined.

Like many medical problems, somatic symptom and related disorders often run in families. They also tend to come and go over time.

Somatic symptom and related disorders can be difficult to diagnose. Your doctor will do a physical exam and possibly order tests. If tests show that you aren’t sick, your doctor may refer you to a mental health provider. In general, your doctor will evaluate whether you are experiencing:

• One or more physical symptoms that are concerning or cause disruption in daily life
• Excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors tied to the physical symptoms or health concerns with at least one of the following: Ongoing thoughts that are larger than the seriousness of symptoms Ongoing anxiety about health or symptoms Excessive time and energy spent on the symptoms or health concerns
• Ongoing thoughts that are larger than the seriousness of symptoms
• Ongoing anxiety about health or symptoms
• Excessive time and energy spent on the symptoms or health concerns
• At least one symptom that is constantly present, although there may be different symptoms and symptoms may come and go

• Ongoing thoughts that are larger than the seriousness of symptoms
• Ongoing anxiety about health or symptoms
• Excessive time and energy spent on the symptoms or health concerns

People with somatic symptom disorder typically see their primary care physician rather than seek counseling or mental health care. This may be due to the fact that people experiencing this disorder can’t accept a mental health diagnosis. They may continue to be fearful and worried even when they are shown evidence that they do not have a serious condition. Some people have only pain as their dominant symptom. Somatic symptom disorder usually begins by age 30.

There is no known way to prevent somatic symptom and related disorders.

Although there is no known cure for somatoform disorders, they can be managed. Treatment focuses on helping the person who has the disorder to live as much of a normal life as possible. Even with treatment, they may still have some pain or other symptoms. Fortunately, a somatoform disorder will not shorten a person’s life.

Your doctor may be able to prescribe medicine for some of your symptoms. They may prescribe an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medicine to treat depressive and anxiety disorders, In many cases you will not need medicine for physical symptoms.

Living with somatic symptom and related disorders can be hard. You may feel as though no one believes that you are really sick. You may not understand why this is happening to you. You may become frustrated with your body. Work with you doctor to manage your symptoms.

Seeing your doctor for regular checkups is the most important part of your treatment. Your doctor will tell you how often they need to see you. You may feel frustrated if your symptoms continue but remember that somatoform disorders can be very difficult to treat. Your doctor will do his or her best to help you maintain your health.",null,null,null,null,null,"• If I have a somatic symptom and related disorder, are my symptoms all in my head?

403,Sore Throat,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sore-throat/,A sore throat means that your throat hurts. It feels irritated or scratchy. You may feel mild discomfort or a burning pain. A sore throat may feel worse when you swallow. Possible complications from a sore throat include ear and sinus infections. Another complication is an abscess (buildup of pus) near your tonsils. There are various ways to soothe a sore throat depending on its cause.,"Depending on the cause of your sore throat, symptoms may include:

• Fever
• Headache
• White spots on your throat or tonsils
• Red, swollen tonsils
• Swollen glands in your neck
• Skin rash

In some cases, additional symptoms may include:

• Abdominal pain (usually in children)
• Vomiting (usually in children)
• Joint or muscle pain","Most sore throats are caused by viruses, such as the cold or flu virus. Some of the more serious causes of sore throat include tonsillitis, strep throat, and mononucleosis (mono). Other causes include smoking, mouth breathing at night while you sleep, pollution, and allergies to pets, pollens and molds. General anesthesia during surgery can also cause a sore throat.","Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will look at the back of your throat. Your doctor may swab the back of your throat. This is called a throat culture. It is done to collect a sample of bacteria. This also is used in a rapid strep test. This is a quick test to diagnose strep throat. The test won’t tell if your sore throat is caused by something other than strep. The results of a throat culture take between 24 and 48 hours. If your doctor thinks you may have mono, they will probably do a blood test.",The best way to avoid a sore throat is to avoid getting sick. Avoid catching or spreading the viruses and bacteria that cause a sore throat. Wash your hands regularly. Avoid touching your eyes or mouth. Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing.,"If your sore throat is cause by the flu, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medicine. Antibiotics don’t work on viruses. Most sore throats caused by a cold or flu-type virus go away in a week to 10 days.

If your sore throat is caused by bacteria, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. You will feel better in a few days. It is important to take all your antibiotics. This reduces the risk that your sore throat will return.

Symptoms caused by mono can last for 4 weeks or more. The treatment for mono is rest and reduced exercise.

If a sore throat is caused by allergies, your doctor may talk to you about allergy triggers. They may recommend medicine for the allergy.

If your sore throat is caused by tonsillitis, you may need an operation. This is called a tonsillectomy. The surgery removes your tonsils. Most people who have tonsillitis don’t need surgery, however you might need surgery if you get severe tonsillitis often. You may need surgery if your tonsils are too big.","Easing the pain of a sore throat is all you can do beyond treatment. There are a few ways to soothe a sore throat:

• Take over-the-counter pain medicine. This includes brand names such as Tylenol, Motrin, and Aleve. Do not give children younger than 18 aspirin. Aspirin may cause Reye’s syndrome, which can be fatal.
• Gargle with warm salt water. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt with 1 cup of water and stir.
• Suck on an over-the-counter throat lozenge. Hard candy works, too.
• Eat a popsicle.
• Use a humidifier in your bedroom. Move it to other rooms you spend time in.

404,Speech and Language Delay,https://familydoctor.org/condition/speech-and-language-delay/,"Every child develops at his or her own pace. But if your child doesn’t talk as much as most children of the same age, the problem may be speech delay.

A speech and language delay is when a child isn’t developing speech and language at an expected rate. It’s a common developmental problem that affects as many as 10% of preschool children.","Your child may have a speech delay if they aren’t able to do these things:

• Say simple words (such as “mama” or “dada”) either clearly or unclearly by 12 to 15 months of age
• Understand simple words (such as “no” or “stop”) by 18 months of age
• Talk in short sentences by 3 years of age
• Tell a simple story at 4 to 5 years of age","The most common causes of speech delay include:

• Hearing loss
• Slow development
• Intellectual disability

Other developmental or genetic disorders include:

• Psychosocial deprivation (the child doesn’t spend enough time talking with adults)
• Being a twin
• Autism (a developmental disorder)
• Elective mutism (the child just doesn’t want to talk)
• Cerebral palsy (a movement disorder caused by brain damage)

Living in a bilingual home also may affect a child’s language and speech. The child’s brain has to work harder to interpret and use 2 languages. So, it may take longer for these children to start using one or both languages they’re learning. It’s not unusual for a bilingual child to use one language for a while.","Your doctor can help you recognize a speech and language delay. They will ask you what you have heard and can listen to your child’s speech and check your child’s mental development.

Your doctor may refer you to other specialists to determine why your child isn’t speaking. For example, if your doctor thinks your child may have trouble hearing, they may refer your child to an audiologist for a hearing test. This is a licensed health care professional who treats hearing problems.","Depending on the cause of your child’s speech delay, you may not be able to prevent or avoid it.","Your child may not need treatment. Some children just take more time to start talking. But if your child needs treatment, the type will depend on the cause of the speech delay. Your doctor will tell you the cause of your child’s issue and talk to you about treatment options. Your doctor may refer you to a speech and language pathologist. This person can show you how to help your child talk more and speak better, and also can teach your child how to listen or how to lip read.

Teaching young babies and children a version of sign language also can help them with their language development. Contrary to what some might think, using sign language with babies and young children does not delay their language development.

Other specialists your doctor may recommend you see include a psychologist (a specialist in behavior problems), an occupational therapist (for help with daily activities), or a social worker (who can help with family problems). Your doctor may also suggest early intervention programs in your area. Many are associated with your local school district","If your child’s speech is delayed due to a hearing loss, hearing aids or cochlear implants may help your child hear speech. Once your child has access to sound (and speech), they may be able to develop language and even catch up to their hearing peers.

If your child hears and understands language, you can encourage them to speak by talking as much as you can around them. Describe what you’re doing as you do everyday activities. Keep talking. If your child speaks, confirm what they are saying. Always provide positive feedback.

Speech and language delays can be frustrating for parents and children. Children who can’t express their thoughts and emotions are more likely to act out. They anger easily. They may use unexpected behavior to get your attention. Try to remember your child does want to communicate with you. Read to your child and talk as much as you can. Encourage your child to speak. When they try to speak, praise their efforts.","• Why is my child not talking yet?
• Should I talk to my child more to help them figure out how to talk?
• Is it normal for my child to not be speaking yet?
• My child seems to have trouble understanding what I’m saying. Is it possible they have hearing loss?
• Does my child have a developmental disability?
• What can I do to help my child speak or understand better?
• Do you have any materials I can read about speech and language delay?
• Will my child be able to attend school?
• Is there an early intervention program available in my area and would it be helpful?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Speech and Language Problems in Children

405,Spina Bifida | Symptoms and Care,https://familydoctor.org/condition/spina-bifida/,"Spina bifida is a birth defect that happens when a baby’s spine and spinal cord don’t close completely during development. This can cause damage to the spinal cord and nerves. It can cause lifelong problems, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Spina bifida is a neural tube defect.

Spina bifida develops in the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant.","With the occulta form of spina bifida, symptoms may never occur. However, symptoms of the meningocele or myelomeningocele forms can be seen after your baby is born. They include:

• An unusually large head that is caused by hydrocephalus (fluid on the brain)
• A bulging soft spot on the top of your baby’s head
• Muscle weakness in your baby’s feet, hips, and legs

Also, if your baby has a dimple or unusual patch of hair in a certain spot on their back, this may alert your doctor to test for spina bifida.

Living with spina bifida depends on the severity of your child’s case. In minor instances, mild complications are possible, including:

• Abnormal nerve sensation
• Skin irritation
• Latex allergy

More serious cases may have severe complications, including:

• Choking and difficulty eating
• Stomach disorders
• Trouble walking
• Paralysis
• Difficulty breathing
• Learning and intellectual disabilities
• Depression (in teen and adult years)
• Urinary tract infections
• Hydrocephalus

In cases where a child has a hard time moving independently, a physical therapist can teach your child how to be mobile. This might include how to use leg braces, a walker, crutches, or a wheelchair.

More severe cases of spina bifida may affect your child’s learning and academic performance. Special education resources within your local school district may provide support. If your child has intellectual disabilities, social services in your community may be able to help them as they get older.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Doctors aren’t sure what causes spina bifida. Genetics and ethnicity (Caucasian and Hispanic) may play a role.

However, you can take steps to reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida.

• The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that all women who are planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 µg) of folic acid. Talk to your doctor about a higher dose if you already have a child with spina bifida.
• Talk to your doctor about your current medicines.
• Control your diabetes and try to lose weight before getting pregnant.
• Avoid overheating your body.
• Treat a fever right away with acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol).","It’s possible for your doctor to diagnose your baby with spina bifida even before they’re born. Your doctor may order a screening during pregnancy if:

• You have another child with spina bifida.
• You have a family history of spina bifida.
• You haven’t been taking folic acid during your pregnancy.
• You have certain health conditions, such as diabetes or obesity.
• You take certain medicine for seizures or depression.

If your doctor wants to do a screening while you’re pregnant, they may do the following:

• Order a blood test to look at how much alpha-fetoprotein your baby is passing to you during pregnancy. This protein is produced in your baby’s liver. It passes through the placenta into the mother’s blood. Too much or too little AFP in the mother’s blood can signal a birth defect.
• Check the level of protein in your amniotic fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds your baby during pregnancy. This is done through a procedure called an amniocentesis.
• Set up an imaging test called an ultrasound. This lets your doctor see your baby inside your body. An abnormal-looking spine may signal spina bifida.

Then, after your baby is born, your doctor may order an X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scan to better check for and determine the severity of spina bifida.","Studies show that folic acid can reduce the risk of spina bifida. Folic acid is a vitamin present in women before and during pregnancy. A pregnant woman should take 400 micrograms of folic acid every day throughout pregnancy. This is especially important for unplanned pregnancies. A higher dose may be necessary for pregnant women with certain risk factors. This includes obesity, diabetes, depression, or a family history of spina bifida.

Eating foods high in folic acid also can help. These include:

• Dark, leafy greens
• Beans
• Peas and lentils
• Seeds and nuts","There’s no medicine or cure for spina bifida. Babies with myelomeningocele and meningocele will likely need treatment. That’s often in the form of surgery. When surgery happens depends on the type and severity of the condition. Some babies may have surgery while they’re still in their mother’s womb. Others will have surgery 1 to 2 days after being born. Some children will need to have repeated surgeries as they grow older.

If your baby has physical disabilities, your doctor also may refer them to a physical therapist. This is a specialist who can help your child increase their strength and balance.",null,"• When should I start taking folic acid during my pregnancy?
• Will I get enough folic acid through food only?
• Is surgery dangerous for a newborn?
• How long will it take until I know if my child has an intellectual disability?",null,"There are three forms — and three levels of severity — of spina bifida.

• Occulta. This is the most common, and least serious, form. It involves a small opening in the spine, but the spinal cord and nerves are healthy. A baby with this type doesn’t have any physical or intellectual disabilities. In fact, this type is usually diagnosed at an older age because there are no outward signs. It’s sometimes detected when a back X-ray is taken for another health issue.
• Meningocele. With this form, the spinal canal is leaking spinal fluid. Also, the spinal cord membranes are damaged. However, there’s no major nerve damage. These babies have a low risk of having a minor physical disability. They may have bowel and bladder control issues.
• Myelomeningocele. This is the most severe form. With this, the spinal canal is open in many places on the baby’s back. The spinal tissues and nerves are sticking out through those openings in a small sac. Spinal fluid often leaks out as well. The spinal cord and nerves are severely damaged. Babies with this type may have paralysis in their lower body. They also may have bowel and bladder control issues."
406,Spinal Cord Injury,https://familydoctor.org/condition/spinal-cord-injury/,"Your spinal cord is made up of bundles of nerves and nerve cells. These carry messages from your brain to the different parts of your body. Your spinal cord runs from the base of your brain to your waist. It is protected by your backbone, or spinal column. The backbone is made up of bony rings in your back called vertebrae.

There are many common causes of spinal cord injury including falling, sports-related events, and car accidents. The spinal cord also can be injured as a result of diseases such as polio or spina bifida.","Symptoms of a spinal cord injury (SCI) vary. They depend on the type, location, and severity of the injury. An entire loss of muscle control and feeling is called a complete SCI. Some muscle control and sensation is called an incomplete SCI. Injuries that occur higher up the spinal cord usually result in more severe symptoms.

Paralysis is a common symptom of spinal cord injuries. It is a loss of movement in part of your body. When this happens, there may be some or no feeling in the paralyzed area. Damaged vertebrae in your neck can paralyze your arms, chest, and legs. It also can affect the muscles that control breathing. Damaged vertebrae in your upper or lower back areas can paralyze your chest and legs.

Immediate signs of an SCI include:

• Numbness, tingling, or loss of feeling
• Weakness
• Dizziness
• Confusion
• Loss of muscle function (paralysis)
• Trouble breathing

In addition to these symptoms, ongoing issues may be:

• Loss of bowel and bladder control
• Sexual dysfunction
• Spasticity (spasms)

If you think someone has an injury to their head, neck, or back:

• Call 911.
• Do not move them (in case of injury).
• Roll up blankets or towels and place them on either side of the person’s head. This helps keep the person’s head and neck in place.
• Perform any first aid, if needed, such as giving CPR or putting pressure on a wound. Again, be sure to keep the person’s head and neck in place.","There are two main causes of a spinal cord injury. The first is a blow to the spinal column. It can damage your spinal cord or the nearby vertebrae or tissue, which can pinch the cord. This can result from a car accident, sports injury, fall, or assault, such as a gunshot or knife wound. Additional damage can occur in the following days. Bleeding, swelling, and fluid buildup can put pressure on your spinal cord.

Disease also can cause a spinal cord injury. Examples include arthritis and polio. Osteoporosis and aging are risk factors. These can weaken your spinal column and make you more prone to SCIs. Spina bifida (“split spine”) is a birth defect that can act like an SCI.","A doctor will diagnose your spinal cord injury. They will keep you immobile (still) during tests at the hospital. Possible tests are an X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests take pictures of the vertebrae to show if there is any damage. Your doctor also will perform a neurological exam. This helps them determine how severe the injury is. They will see how much muscle control you have and whether or not you can feel sensations. All of these tests diagnose the level and completeness of your injury.","SCIs that occur from disease cannot be prevented. However, SCIs that are caused by accidents or sports injuries may be prevented. Prevention would include not participating in the activity that puts you at risk for injury.","A team of doctors will decide the best treatment for your spinal cord injury. In the short-term, medicine can help reduce swelling of the SCI. Methylprednisolone is a cortisone or steroid medicine. If it is given right away, it can reduce damage to your nerve cells. You may need surgery to stabilize your spine or remove bone or tissue that is pressing on your spinal cord. Your doctor will put you in traction to keep your head and body still during surgery.

Long-term treatment options have several benefits. They help prevent blood clots, muscle shrinkage, calcium loss, and thinning of your skin. Treatments include:

• Medicine. Certain medicines and injections can help control some SCI symptoms. For example, botulinum toxin regulates arm spasms. Talk to your doctor about what works best for your type of injury and symptoms. Medicine also helps manage pain.
• Physical therapy. In some cases, physical therapy can help with muscle function. It consists of stretching, strengthening, and muscle training. It can provide flexibility, control, coordination, and strength.
• Occupational therapy. This type of therapy can help you relearn daily tasks, such as bathing, dressing, cooking, and writing. Your body may have forgotten how to do these tasks since the injury. It also provides education to prevent future health problems.
• Experimental treatments. Researchers are working to find a cure for spinal cord injuries. Talk to your doctor about new treatments that may be available.","Your recovery depends on how severe your injury is. In most cases, improvement occurs within the first 6 months of injury. However, some people continue to make progress beyond that. There is no cure for SCIs, so you will need ongoing treatment.

People who have spinal cord injuries can live full, happy lives. They can work, get married, and have children. Some can go to events, play sports, and drive cars. Continued research focuses on finding a cure and providing new treatment options.","• Will my spinal cord injury improve over time?
• How much movement and feeling can I expect to recover?
• How will my spinal cord injury affect my other health? Does it put me at risk of other issues?
• What experimental treatments are available for me?
• Can you recommend a support group for people with spinal cord injuries?","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke: Spinal Cord Injury

407,Squamous Cell Carcinoma,https://familydoctor.org/condition/squamous-cell-carcinoma/,"Squamous cell carcinoma is a common form of skin cancer. It develops in the thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the skin. It is usually caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This can happen by being outside in the sun, or by using tanning beds. Squamous cell carcinoma usually is found on the face, ears, neck, hands, or arms. It can also occur in other areas of the body.","The main symptom of squamous cell carcinoma is a new or changing bump, growth, lesion, skin spot, or rough patch of skin. Not all skin cancers look the same. A helpful way to see if you have signs of skin cancer is called the ABCDE rule. Look at your skin spots for these signs:

• A for asymmetry: Skin spot is not symmetrical. If it was folded in half, the two halves wouldn’t match.
• B for border: Edges of the skin spot are blurry or jagged
• C for color: Changes in the color of a skin spot. This could be darkening, loss of color, spreading color, or multiple color.
• D for diameter: A skin spot more than ¼ inch in diameter
• E or evolving: Skin spot looks different from others or is changing in shape, size, or color.

Other signs of cancer could include:

• A skin spot that itches or bleeds
• A fast-growing skin spot(s)
• A scaly or crusted growth on the skin
• A sore that won’t heal
• A patch of skin that has changed color

If you notice any of these symptoms, or if you have a new skin spot that looks different from your other skin spots, see your family doctor right away.","Most cases of squamous cell carcinoma are caused by too much exposure to UV radiation. This can come from the sun or from UV lights in tanning beds.

Some people are more at risk of developing this form of skin cancer. Things that could increase your risk include:

• Having fair skin, blonde, or red hair, and light-colored eyes
• Long-term sun exposure, such as from working outside
• A history of bad sunburns, especially as a child or teenager
• Using indoor tanning beds
• Having a weakened immune system, including having an organ transplant","The first step in diagnosing squamous cell carcinoma is regular self-examination. By checking your skin and skin spots regularly, you become familiar with what is normal for you. Then, if you see something abnormal, you can see your doctor.

Your doctor will examine your skin. They will look at the size, shape, color, and texture of any concerning areas. If you have changes that could be skin cancer, your doctor will remove a piece of the affected skin. This is called a biopsy. The piece of skin will be sent to a lab for testing.

If skin cancer is diagnosed, you may need to undergo more tests to see if the cancer cells have spread. These tests could include imaging, such as a chest X-ray, CT scan, MRI, or PET scan, or lymph node biopsy.","Most cases of squamous cell carcinoma can be prevented by avoiding exposure to UV rays.

• Avoid the sun, especially during peak hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
• Use sunscreen, even on cloudy days.
• Wear a wide-brimmed hat, protective clothing, and sunglasses when you go outside.
• Avoid places that reflect light, such as water, sand, or concrete
• Don’t try to get a tan, including using tanning beds or sunlamps.","If squamous cell carcinoma is caught early, it is usually easy to treat. Examine your skin once a month. See your family doctor right away if you find anything that looks suspicious.

Treatment for squamous cell carcinoma depends on several factors. These include where the cancer is, how big it is, how far it has spread, and your general health. Most cases can be taken care of with a minor surgical procedure or topical treatment (liquid, cream, or ointment).

• Excision: Cancerous tissue is cut out
• Freezing: Cancer cells are frozen with liquid nitrogen
• Medicated creams: Topical creams or lotions with anti-cancer medicine are applied directly to the affected skin
• Dermabrasion: Cancerous tissue is “sanded” away
• Laser therapy: An intense light beam vaporizes cancer cells
• Curettage: Surface of the cancer is scraped away, and the base is treated with liquid nitrogen or an electric current to kill remaining cancer cells
• Mohs surgery: Cancer is removed and examined layer by layer, preventing the removal of healthy tissue
• Radiation: High-energy beams, such as X-rays, kill cancerous cells","Most cases of squamous cell carcinoma can be cured with treatment. How well you do after treatment depends on many things, including how early the cancer was diagnosed. Left untreated, this skin cancer can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, including internal organs. This could cause serious health problems and advance the stage of the cancer. The earlier this skin cancer is found and treated, the better.

Some cancers like this can return. If you’ve had skin cancer before, you are at higher risk of getting it again.","• I spent a lot of time in the sun as a child. Am I at higher risk of developing skin cancer?
• One of my parents had skin cancer. Am I more likely to get it?
• What should I look for when I do a self-examination of my skin?
• I have darker skin. Can I still get skin cancer?
• What can I do to protect my child from the sun?
• Is there anything I can do to keep the cancer from coming back after treatment?

408,STI Symptoms and Prevention,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis/,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections you can get by having sex with someone who has an infection. These infections are usually passed from person to person through vaginal intercourse. They can also be passed through anal sex, oral sex, or skin-to-skin contact. STIs can be caused by viruses or bacteria. STIs caused by viruses include hepatitis B, herpes, HIV, and the human papilloma virus (HPV). STIs caused by bacteria include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common, but many people don’t recognize the signs or know how to protect themselves. Understanding STI symptoms and prevention is essential for maintaining sexual health. Some infections cause visible symptoms, while others may go unnoticed without testing. Knowing how STIs spread—and how to reduce your risk—can help you stay healthy and informed.

The most common symptoms of STIs include:

• Itching around the vagina and/or discharge from the vagina for women.
• Discharge from the penis for men.
• Pain during sex or when urinating.
• Pain in the pelvic area.
• Sore throats in people who have oral sex.
• Pain in or around the anus for people who have anal sex.
• Chancre sores (painless red sores) on the genital area, anus, tongue, and/or throat.
• A scaly rash on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.
• Dark urine, loose, light-colored stools, and yellow eyes and skin.
• Small blisters that turn into scabs on the genital area.
• Swollen glands, fever, and body aches.
• Unusual infections, unexplained fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss.
• Soft, flesh-colored warts around the genital area.","If you’ve ever had sex, you may be at risk for having an STI. Your risk is higher if you have had many sex partners, have had sex with someone who has had many partners, or have had sex without using condoms.","Most STIs can be diagnosed through an exam by your doctor, a culture of the secretions from your vagina or penis, or through a blood test.

STIs that are caused by bacteria (such as chlamydia) can be cured with antibiotics. But STIs caused by a virus (such as HIV or herpes) can’t be cured. Your doctor can only treat the symptoms that the virus causes.

Don’t wait to be treated. Early treatment helps prevent serious health problems. Even if medicine can’t completely cure the STI, it can help keep you from getting really sick. If you are given medicine for an STI, take it exactly as the doctor says.","The only sure way to prevent STIs is by not having sex. If you have sex, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by only having sex with someone who isn’t having sex with anyone else and who doesn’t have an STI.

You should always use condoms when having sex, including oral and anal sex.

No. It was once thought that spermicides with nonoxynol-9 could help prevent STIs much like they help prevent pregnancy — by damaging the organisms that cause the diseases. New research has shown that nonoxynol-9 can irritate a woman’s vagina and cervix, actually increasing the risk of STI infection.

Be sure to check the ingredients of any other sex-related products you own, such as lubricants and condoms. Some brands of these products may have nonoxynol-9 added to them. If you are unsure if your spermicide or any other product contains nonoxynol-9, ask your doctor before using it.",null,"See your doctor if you’re at risk for having an STI, if you have any of the symptoms, or if you have concerns about whether you have one. STIs can cause serious health problems if left untreated.

For example, chlamydia can lead to problems that can cause women not to be able to have children (infertility). HPV can lead to cancer of the cervix or penis. Syphilis can lead to paralysis, mental problems, heart damage, blindness, and even death.

Being informed about STI symptoms and prevention empowers you to take control of your sexual health. Regular testing, practicing safe sex, and knowing the signs of infection can help you prevent complications and protect both yourself and your partners. If you have questions or think you may have been exposed to an STI, talk to your doctor for guidance and care.","• Do I have a viral or bacterial STI?
• What treatment is best for me?
• Is it possible to have sex with my boyfriend/girlfriend without giving him/her my STI?
• How can I stop from getting an STI?
• If I have one STI, am I at higher risk of getting another?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Ask. Although it may be uncomfortable, talk to your partner before having any sexual contact. Ask if he or she is at risk for having an STI. Some of the risk factors are having sex with several partners, using injected drugs and having had an STI in the past. To be safe, protect yourself no matter what the person says. You must also tell your partner if you have an STI. You aren’t doing yourself or your partner any favors by trying to hide it.

Male latex condoms can reduce your risk of getting an STI if used correctly. Be sure to use them every time you have sex. Female condoms aren’t as effective as male condoms. However, you should use them when a man won’t use a male condom.

Remember, though, that condoms aren’t 100% safe. They can’t protect you from coming into contact with some sores (such as those that can occur with herpes) or warts (which can be caused by HPV infection).

• Put the condom on before any contact is made.
• Unroll the condom over an erect penis to the base of the penis. (Uncircumcised men should pull back their foreskin before unrolling.) The unrolled ring should be on the outside. Leave about 1/2 inch of space in the tip so semen can collect there. Squeeze the tip to get the air out.
• Pull out after ejaculating and before the penis gets soft. To pull out, hold the rim of the condom at the base of the penis to make sure it doesn’t slip off.
• Don’t reuse condoms.

• Follow the directions on the condom package for correct placement. Be sure the inner ring goes as far into the vagina as it can. The outer ring stays outside the vagina.
• Guide the penis into the condom.
• After sex, remove the condom before standing up by gently pulling it out.
• Don’t reuse condoms.

Limit the number of sex partners you have. Ask your partner if he or she has, or has had, an STI. Tell your partner if you have had one. Talk about whether you’ve both been tested for STIs and whether you should be tested.

Look for signs of an STI in your sex partner. But remember that STIs don’t always cause symptoms. Don’t have sex if you or your partner are being treated for an STI.

Wash your genitals with soap and water and urinate soon after you have sex. This may help clean away some germs before they have a chance to infect you."
409,Stomach Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/stomach-cancer/,Stomach cancer (also called gastric cancer) is the growth of cancer cells in the lining and wall of the stomach.,"Sometimes cancer can grow in the stomach for a long time before it causes symptoms. In the early stages, stomach cancer can cause the following symptoms:

• Indigestion, stomach discomfort, or heartburn
• Nausea
• Loss of appetite
• Fatigue

When the cancer is larger, it can cause these symptoms:

• Blood in your stool or stools that are black in color
• A bloated feeling after eating, even when eating a small amount
• Vomiting after meals
• Unintended weight loss
• Stomach pain, especially after meals
• Weakness and fatigue

Many of these symptoms may be caused by conditions other than cancer. However, if you have any of these problems and they don’t go away, talk to your doctor. The earlier stomach cancer is found, the better the chances for effective treatment.","Your chances of getting stomach cancer are higher if you have had a stomach infection caused by bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (also called H. pylori). That can cause ulcers in the stomach. You’re also more likely to get stomach cancer if you:

• Are a man
• Are older than 50 years of age
• Have a close relative who has had stomach cancer
• Smoke cigarettes
• Abuse alcohol
• Are an African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander
• Have stomach polyps(small growths in the lining of your stomach)","If your doctor suspects that you might have stomach cancer, they will look at your medical history and do a complete physical exam. Your doctor might order a computed tomography (CT scan). Your doctor might also (or instead) refer you to a specialist for an endoscopy to try to see the tumor. For this exam, your doctor will place a thin, lighted tube into your mouth and pass down to your stomach. Your doctor may give you medicine before the test to make you more comfortable.

During endoscopy, your doctor might remove a small piece of your stomach to check it for cancer cells. This is called a biopsy sample. The sample is then sent to a lab where it’s looked at under a microscope to determine if it’s cancerous.","There is no way to prevent stomach cancer. However, you can help reduce your risk of stomach cancer by not smoking and by limiting how much alcohol you drink. Also, maintain a healthy weight and eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables.","Treatments for stomach cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted drug therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. The choice of treatment depends on whether the cancer is just in the stomach or if it has spread to other places in the body. Your age and overall health will also affect the choice of treatment.","Medical treatment may remove or destroy your cancer. Even though you will feel relieved, you may worry, too. You may be afraid that the cancer will return. It’s completely normal to feel this way. It may be comforting to know that your doctor will still want to monitor your closely. You may need to see your doctor every 3 to 6 months for a few years.

If part of your cancer treatment involved removing all or part of your stomach, your doctor will refer you to a nutritionist. The nutritionist will help you plan meals so you get the vitamins and minerals that your body needs. You may also need to take vitamin supplements.

Following treatment, your cancer may not completely go away. It can turn into a chronic condition. This can be stressful for you and your loved ones. You may need chemotherapy or other treatments to help control the cancer. These treatments can keep the cancer small and keep it from growing. When it’s not growing, you can take a break from treatment until it begins growing again.

If you have chronic cancer, it is important to find support for you and your family. Talk to a counselor, a minister or rabbi, or a support group. Know that you aren’t facing cancer alone.","• I have a stomach ulcer. Am I more likely to get stomach cancer?
• Will eating a healthy diet help me to prevent getting stomach cancer?
• My father had stomach cancer. Should I be tested for it?
• What is the best treatment for my stomach cancer?
• Will I be able to eat normally after my treatment?
• After my treatment, will I have to come back often to make sure my stomach cancer doesn’t come back?
• During and after treatment, should I quit drinking alcohol?","American Cancer Society: Stomach Cancer

It is not the same as influenza. That is a respiratory illness. This is an inflammation of your stomach lining. A stomach virus can strike anyone at any age. It can be harmful for babies, older people, and anyone with a low immune system who may develop complications. These viruses are usually mild and go away on their own. Severe cases of the stomach virus can lead to other health problems or death.

• Headache and body aches","Several things can cause a stomach virus:

• Norovirus: This is the main cause. This represents a family of viruses.
• Rotavirus: This is a viral infection. This is common in babies and young kids.

Viral stomach infections are contagious. It is easy to get and give a stomach virus. It is spread by contact with an infected person, surface, or object. Stomach viruses are likely to spread at places with a lot of people. This includes schools, daycares, nursing homes, airplanes, cruise ships, and hospitals. Stomach viruses are common in cold weather months.",Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms. Your doctor may ask you to provide a stool sample.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends children get a rotavirus vaccine. Two different vaccines exist. They require 2 to 3 doses. Children should receive the full vaccine prior to 8 months of age.

You can help prevent or avoid a stomach virus by doing these things:

• Wash your hands often.
• Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough.
• Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects in your home, office, and classroom.
• Use hand sanitizer after being in public.
• Separate the laundry of a sick person from the rest of the family.
• Stay away from people who have the virus.

If you have stomach virus, be responsible. Do not expose others to it. This includes babies, older people, and people with a low immune system. Do not go to school, work, or public places.","There is no medicine that can treat a stomach virus. It has to run its course. You can do things to ease symptoms:

• Eat bland foods.
• Drink clear, fizzy drinks (ginger ale is best).
• Stay hydrated.

Vomiting, diarrhea, and not eating or drinking causes dehydration. If you are dehydrated, you may need to go to the hospital for IV fluids. A saline solution will be injected into your veins to replace your fluids. Signs you are dehydrated include:

• Dark, yellow urine
• Increased thirst
• Feeling dizzy or fainting
• Rapid heartbeat
• Rapid breathing
• Lack of energy
• Confusion
• Irritability
• Babies will be fussy and cry (they will not have tears if they are dehydrated)

Water or sports drinks with vitamins and nutrients are helpful. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.

Stay home and get plenty of rest. Adults can take over-the-counter medicine, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, to help reduce fever and pain. Contact your doctor if your symptoms persist or get worse. Severe symptoms include seizures.","Stomach viruses are often mild and go away on their own in 1 to 3 days. Babies, older adults, or people who have low immune systems should see the doctor right away. This can help prevent their infection from getting worse.","• How do I know if the virus is the norovirus or rotavirus?
• Can I get the virus more than once a season?
• What should I do if I am pregnant and have a stomach virus?

411,Strabismus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/strabismus-cross-eyes/,"Strabismus is an eye disorder. It affects the muscle control in your eyes. The eyes don’t line up properly. Instead, the eyes appear to cross, or one eye may wander to the side. One eye’s vision becomes weaker. This disorder also is called “crossed eyes.” If it is not fixed when a child is young, their brain will always ignore what it sees from the weak eye.","You may notice your child closes one eye to see with the other. You also may see your child turn their head to one side to see. Other symptoms can include:

• Crossed eyes
• Wandering eyes
• Eyes that don’t point in the same direction
• Loss of vision or depth perception

People who develop strabismus as adults are likely to have double vision. That’s because their brain has learned how to read images from both eyes. Then, when strabismus is diagnosed, the brain still sees images from both eyes, even though the eyes are looking at different things. Hence the double vision.

Symptoms may be present all the time or may come and go. It’s normal for newborn babies to have eyes that cross or wander. It happens more when they are tired. If your child is older than 3 months of age, tell your doctor if you see notice these symptoms.","There are six muscles around each eye. When these muscles don’t work together, each eye sees different things. This confuses the brain. The brain learns to focus on the image from the stronger eye.

In most children with strabismus, the cause is unknown. More than half the time, the problem is present at or shortly after birth. This is called congenital strabismus.

Conditions occasionally associated with strabismus in children include:

• Cerebral palsy
• Down Syndrome
• Being farsighted
• Hydrocephalus (abnormal fluid build-up on the brain)
• Traumatic brain injury

Strabismus that develops in adults can be caused by:

• Botulism
• Diabetes
• Graves’ disease
• Guillain-Barré syndrome
• Injury to the eye
• Shellfish poisoning
• Stroke
• Traumatic brain injury
• Vision loss from any eye disease or injury

A family history of strabismus is a risk factor. Farsightedness may be a contributing factor in children.",Your doctor will talk with you about your symptoms and do a physical exam. This will include checking your eyes through various eye tests.,This disorder cannot be prevented or avoided.,"Treatment is important. If not treated, the weaker eye will never see well. Treatment can help your child have normal vision. The earlier the treatment starts, the better.

Treatment focuses on making the weak or wandering eye stronger. This could involve wearing a corrective glasses or an eye patch. Putting eye drops in the “good” eye can make the weak eye stronger. Treatment can temporarily affect vision in both eyes.

Some children need surgery. It is usually not recommended until after other treatments have been tried. Surgery is simple, but it doesn’t always make the eyes perfectly straight. Sometimes surgery has to be repeated later.

Treatment for strabismus may go on for months or even a few years. Your child may have to wear their eye patch less over time. The same is true for eye drops.","Your doctor may recommend your child does eye exercises. These can help the eyes focus on the same spot.

About one-third of children with strabismus will develop amblyopia. This is a lazy eye. If amblyopia is not treated by about age 11, it is likely to be permanent. That’s why early treatment is so important.

If your child has surgery, know that vision problems may remain after surgery. Your child may still have reading problems. Vision may affect the ability to play sports. Adults may have a hard time driving.","• Are there certain eye exercises my child can do that will help?
• How many hours a day does my child need to wear an eye patch?
• Does this condition cause kids or adults to become dizzy?
• If one of my children has strabismus, are my other children at higher risk?
• If treatment is successful, will my child have vision problems later in life?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Strabismus

412,Strep Throat,https://familydoctor.org/condition/strep-throat/,Strep throat is an infection caused by bacteria. It is called “strep” because the bacteria that causes the infection is called streptococcus. Strep throat makes your throat feel very sore with painful swallowing. Your throat may also feel scratchy and raw.,"The symptoms of strep throat include:

• Sore throat
• Fever
• Swollen, sore neck glands
• Red and swollen tonsils
• White patches in the throat or on the tonsils
• Headache

In addition to the symptoms listed above, children may also have these symptoms:

• Abdominal pain
• Vomiting
• Red rash with small spots that is worse under the arms and in skin creases","Strep throat is caused by bacteria. It spreads easily from person to person. You can get it by coming into contact with the nose fluids or saliva of someone who has strep throat. Strep throat is most common in young children, but people of all ages can get it.","Your doctor may use a test called the rapid strep test to diagnose strep throat. For this test, the doctor uses a long cotton swab to take some of the fluid or mucus from the back of your throat. The results of this test can be ready in less than 15 minutes.

Your doctor may also do a culture of your mucus. If so, he or she will send a sample of your mucus to a laboratory. This test is called a throat culture. It can take up to 2 days to learn the results of a strep culture.

The rapid strep test and the culture can tell your doctor if you have strep throat. If something else is causing your sore throat, these tests do not tell what it is.","Strep throat is very contagious. It can be hard to protect yourself when you are around people who are infected with strep throat. Try to avoid people who have strep, when possible. If you must be around someone who has strep throat, be sure to wash your hands frequently. Hand washing is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of germs.","Strep throat is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics kill bacteria. Killing bacteria helps ease the symptoms of strep throat and helps it go away a little faster. Antibiotics can also prevent a few rare, but serious conditions that people who have strep throat might develop. These include rheumatic fever or kidney inflammation.

It is important to take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes. This reduces the risk that your symptoms will return. It also helps prevent antibiotic resistance.

No. Not every sore throat is strep throat. Bacteria only cause a small portion of all sore throats. The rest are caused by viruses or other problems that antibiotics do not help. Your doctor can do a test to check for strep throat.","Strep throat is an infection that typically comes and goes, especially when you’re younger. If you have recurring strep throat, it could be that someone in your family is a carrier of strep. Carriers have the strep bacteria in their throats, but it does not make them sick. Treating carriers can help prevent the spread of strep.","• If I have a sore throat and a fever, should I go to the doctor?
• How long will it be before my test results come back?
• What kind of antibiotic should I take?
• What should I do to make my child more comfortable while he/she has strep throat?
• My child seems to get strep throat a lot. Could this be a problem with his/her tonsils?
• Should I stay away from my family members while I have strep throat?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Strep Throat: All You Need to Know

You can pass the strep infection to other people until you have been treated appropriately with an antibiotic. Children who have strep throat should not go back to school or daycare until their fever has gone away and they have taken an antibiotic for at least 24 hours.

Here are more things you can do to prevent spreading strep throat:

• Frequently wash your hands.
• Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.
• Avoid sharing food utensils (such as drinking glasses, spoons, or forks) while you are sick.

Here are some things that might help you feel better:

• Take ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) to relieve pain and reduce fever. Children should not take aspirin. Aspirin can cause a serious illness called Reye’s syndrome when it is given to children younger than 18 years of age.
• Gargle with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup [8 ounces] of warm water).
• Adults and older children can suck on throat lozenges, hard candy, pieces of ice, or popsicles.
• Eat soft foods (such as yogurt and applesauce) and drink cool drinks or warm liquids (such as broths, soups, and tea).
• Get plenty of rest. Sleep helps your body fight infection.
• Drink plenty of water. This helps keep your throat lubricated and helps prevent dehydration.
• Avoid acidic or spicy foods and drinks (such as orange juice and peppers)."
413,Stroke,https://familydoctor.org/condition/stroke/,"A stroke is a medical condition. It happens when the blood flow to your brain stops. When this happens, it causes your brain cells to die (within minutes of the stroke). There are two types of strokes: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic strokes are the most common. They are caused by a blood clot. That clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain. With a hemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain.

When you have a stroke, you may lose the ability to do something that is controlled by the injured part of your brain. For example, you could lose the use of an arm or leg. You could lose the ability to speak. The damage can be temporary or permanent. IMPORTANT: The sooner you get treatment after stroke symptoms start, the better the chance of getting blood flow to your brain. This prevents more damage. People who have had a stroke are more likely to have another stroke. The risk is especially high during the year after your first stroke.","Call for emergency help immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:

• Sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg on one side of your body
• Sudden dimness or loss of vision, particularly in one eye
• Trouble talking or understanding what others are saying
• Sudden severe headache with no known cause
• Sudden unexplained dizziness
• Falling or unstable walking

Also, these symptoms can tell you if someone else is having a stroke. It’s called the F.A.S.T. test:

• F is for Face drooping. Does one side of the face droop when the person tries to smile?
• A is for Arm weakness. When the person raises both arms, does one arm drift downward?
• S is for Speech difficulty. Can the person repeat a simple sentence (for example, “The sky is blue.”) correctly? Is their speech slurred?
• T is for Time to call for emergency help. It’s important to get help immediately if a person has any of these symptoms.

Another condition that is similar to stroke is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is a “mini-stroke.” It causes the same symptoms listed above. Your symptoms may only last a few minutes. However, do not ignore it. Having a TIA increases your risk of having a stroke later. Call your doctor immediately if you think you are having a TIA.","Certain risk factors contribute to having a stroke. Some stroke risk factors can be changed, treated, or controlled. For example, high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can be controlled. Other risk factors include:

• Smoking
• Being overweight
• Being inactive
• Uncontrolled diabetes
• High cholesterol
• Over age 55 years
• Family history of stroke
• Being African American
• Being female
• Having a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack","Immediate medical care is critical after having a stroke. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and health history. Then they will perform a physical exam. Your doctor also will want to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. They will want to know if you fell and suffered a head injury. If your doctor suspects you have had a stroke, you will have more tests. These tests may include:

• Blood tests. This will give your doctor information about how quickly your blood is clotting and your blood sugar levels. Controlling how quickly your blood clots and your blood sugar level is necessary to prevent further damage.
• Computerized tomography (CT) brain scan. A CT scan is similar to an X-ray. This test will be performed on your head to see your brain. Pictures from the scan can tell your doctor if you have had bleeding, a tumor, a stroke, or other medical conditions. Sometimes, a dye will be injected into your arm to “light up” your blood vessels. This gives your doctor better details of what’s going on in your brain and neck.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI is another type of scan that allows your doctor to see your brain. An MRI is sensitive enough to examine damaged brain tissue and bleeding. Sometimes, a dye is used for an MRI, as well.
• Carotid ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the carotid arteries in your neck. It can show your doctor how well your blood is flowing through your carotid arteries. Also, it shows whether you have a buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) in those arteries.
• Cerebral angiogram. This test involves inserting a thin, flexible tube into your groin (near your upper thigh). The tube travels through your major arteries and into your carotid artery. Dye is used for this test too. Once it is in, an X-ray will help your doctor get a clear view of the arteries in your neck and brain.
• Transesophageal echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to give your doctor clear pictures of your heart. An echocardiogram can detect the source of blood clots in your heart that may have traveled to your brain and caused your stroke. During this test, a flexible tube attached to a small device (transducer) is inserted down your throat. It connects the back of your mouth to your stomach. This gives your doctor clear pictures of your heart and any blood clots.","Changing those risk factors that you can control will help reduce your risk of stroke. This includes:

• Stop smoking.
• Reduce your alcohol intake.
• Control your blood pressure.
• Control your cholesterol.
• Control your blood sugar with medicine, diet, and exercise if you have diabetes.
• Get regular physical activity.
• Maintain a healthy weight.

Have regular checkups so that your doctor can help you manage health conditions that increase your risk of having a stroke. Ask your doctor for advice on making lifestyle changes to decrease your risk of stroke. Talk to your doctor about current guidelines for taking aspirin in low doses to reduce your risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Aspirin can help keep your blood from forming clots that block your arteries. If your doctor recommends taking low-dose aspirin, it is important to follow their instructions so that you get the most benefit with the fewest side effects.","Quick, emergency care is important in treating a stroke. Emergency room treatment depends on whether you had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Immediate treatment options include the use of blood-thinning (clot bluster) medicine, surgery, or other procedures.

Following immediate treatment, controlling the underlying health conditions that caused your stroke is important. That means controlling your diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, and making lifestyle changes.

Stroke rehabilitation is an important part of recovery after a stroke. It helps build your strength, coordination, endurance, and confidence. A main goal of stroke rehabilitation is to help you learn how to live with the effects of the stroke. This will help you be as independent as possible. It may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy. Your doctor will decide what kind of rehabilitation will be helpful for you. Rehabilitation can begin as soon as the stroke is over, and you are stable. In many cases, it starts in the hospital as soon as 24 to 48 hours after a stroke. Most people need to continue rehabilitation for months or years after a stroke.

If you have a loved one who had a stroke, they will need your help and support. Some places offer classes for stroke survivors and their families. You may be able to go to some of your loved one’s rehabilitation sessions. This is a good way to learn how stroke rehabilitation works and how you can help your loved one get better.

Find out what they can do alone, what they can do with help, and what they can’t do at all. Tell the rehabilitation staff what activities your loved one enjoys. Help your loved one practice the skills learned in stroke rehabilitation. For example, avoid helping your loved one do things that they are able to do alone. Practicing skills will build your loved one’s confidence.","Living with stroke will mean managing your health conditions that cause it. Also, it will mean living with the temporary or permanent side effects. The following are the most common side effects of stroke:

• Weakness or paralysis on one side of the body
• Problems with speech and language
• Poor balance or clumsy movement
• Ignoring or being unaware of one side of the body
• Trouble swallowing
• Problems with bladder or bowel control
• Problems with memory, thinking, or problem-solving
• Poor vision and/or changes in vision
• Numbness

Brain injury and loss of function from a stroke can lead to emotional changes, too. Soon after the stroke, you may have trouble controlling your emotions. Your moods may change more quickly than they did before the stroke. For example, you may suddenly start crying or laughing for no reason. Usually, this gets better over time.

It is normal to feel depressed, sad, or frustrated as you get used to the changes caused by a stroke. These reactions can be treated. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling so that they can help.

Driving is another issue if you have had a stroke. Your doctor can advise you if it is safe for you to drive again. Having a stroke can affect your mobility, vision, and thinking. Your reaction time may be slower. These changes can make driving a car unsafe for you and for other people on the road. If your doctor says that it is safe for you to drive again, contact your state’s department of motor vehicles. Ask about the rules for people who have had a stroke. You may have to take a driving test or a class. Driver training programs are often available through rehabilitation centers.

It can be frustrating if you can’t drive after having a stroke. Other options for getting around include public transportation, specialized vans, taxis, and getting rides from friends and family members. Community resources such as senior citizen groups and local volunteer agencies may also be able to help.","• Will taking low-dose aspirin cause me to have an ulcer?

414,Stuttering | Causes and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/stuttering/,"Stuttering is a condition that affects a person’s ability to speak smoothly. It can cause them to repeat words, parts of sentences, or sounds. Someone who stutters might prolong the pronunciation of a single word or sound. They may tense up their facial muscles as they struggle to speak.

Most cases of stuttering begin when children are between 2 and 6 years old, when they are developing their vocabulary. Boys are more likely to stutter than girls. Stuttering usually stops by the time children enter school, but adults can stutter, too. However, fewer than 1% of cases are found in adults.","Typically, the first signs of stuttering appear when a child is 18-24 months old. This is when they start putting sentences together and their vocabulary really starts to expand. It’s normal for children to have some stuttering at this stage.

Your child may stutter for a few weeks or several months. The stuttering may come and go. For most children, stuttering stops by the time they’re 5 years old. But for some, the stuttering is frequent. It might continue to get worse. It might also be accompanied by facial or body movements. For these children, treatment may be necessary.

Stuttering is apparent in a person’s speech flow. For example, when saying the word, “where,” it might sound like, “W… w… w… where.” Words starting with the letters “k,” “g,” and “t” may be difficult starting sounds for people who stutter.

Another sign of a stutter is the prolonged pronunciation of a word, such as, “My graaanndma gave me a cookie.” Repeating entire phrases or sentences is another sign of stuttering. For example, you might hear the person start off smooth and then repeat the last few words: “I can play with you, but I have to check … I have to check … I have to check with my parents first.”

You also may notice physical signs that are characteristic of stuttering. These include the head and eyes rolling backward as the person struggles to get his or her words out. They also include rapid eye blinking, or a tightening of the muscles around the mouth.

Stuttering may increase during certain social situations. For example, speaking in front of a group or talking on the phone may make it worse. Some activities can make it better. These include singing, reading, or speaking in unison with other people.","Research is still being done to identify the cause of stuttering. It can occur from the natural process of organizing your thoughts and words. A combination of factors can also cause people to stutter, including:

• A family history of stuttering
• Intellectual disabilities
• Problems with speech motor control
• Brain injuries or other severe medical conditions
• Emotional and mental health problems","Parents, teachers, and family members are often the first to notice a child is stuttering. Tell your doctor if your child stutters, even at the early age of 2 years old. Your doctor may refer you to early intervention services provided by your local community. They may also refer you to a speech-language pathologist. This is a health professional who specializes in voice, speech, and language disorders.

The speech-language pathologist will consider several factors when diagnosing your child. They will ask you about your child’s history, their stuttering behaviors, and the impact stuttering has on their life. They will also try to determine if your child is likely to outgrow their stuttering. To do this, they will evaluate family history, how long the stuttering has lasted, and if your child has any other speech or language problems.","No one knows why stuttering occurs, so there is no way to prevent or avoid it. Once you suspect or notice that stuttering may be a problem for your child, don’t ignore it. Early intervention can help.","Talk to your doctor if your child stutters, even if they’re young. Early treatment can help prevent stuttering from becoming a lifelong problem. Treatment will depend on the severity and frequency of your child’s stuttering. Your doctor may refer your child to a speech therapist for treatment. You’ll likely have many appointments with the speech therapist. They will also give you speech exercises to do at home. It’s important to follow your speech therapist’s treatment plan.

Treatment also involves teaching parents ways to support their child. You may be encouraged to:

• Provide a relaxed environment at home.
• Give your child many opportunities to speak.
• Speak in a slow and relaxed manner, so your child doesn’t feel pressure to talk quickly.
• Listen when your child speaks. Don’t interrupt or finish their sentences. Wait for them to say what they want to say.
• Focus on the content of what your child is saying, not on how it’s being delivered.

Don’t discipline your child for stuttering. Be patient. Not being patient when your child is speaking only makes the stuttering worse. It embarrasses your child more.","There are many ways you can help your child:

• Build your child’s confidence by remaining patient.
• Stay positive and make eye contact with your child while they’re talking.
• Provide opportunities for your child to practice speaking exercises, such as family dinners, car rides, and family time.
• Avoid certain situations you know will make the stuttering worse.
• Encourage conversation in less stressful situations to make your child relaxed.","• What if my child never stops stuttering? How will that affect their adult life?
• Is there anything I can do at home to help my child?
• How often will we need to see a speech therapist?
• Is it true that singing can sometimes help a person overcome stuttering?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Stuttering

415,Sty,https://familydoctor.org/condition/sty/,"A sty is a painful, red bump that forms on the edge of your eyelid. It may look like an acne pimple. Sties may cause discomfort, but they are not usually serious and are easy to treat. They are very common, especially in children.","The main symptom is a swollen, painful, red bump on the edge of the eyelid. It usually forms on the outside of the eyelid. But sometimes it forms on the inside. You may also have the following:

• Discharge from the eye
• Tearing of the eye
• Scratchy feeling in the eye
• Crusting on the eyelid",null,Your family doctor can diagnose a sty by examining your eye. No special tests are needed.,"The best way to avoid getting sties is to practice good eye hygiene. Make sure you keep your eyes clean. Remove makeup and dirt. Throw away old eye makeup (for example, mascara should be replaced every 2 to 3 months). Do not share makeup with others. Always wash your hands before touching your eyes. If you wear contacts, wash your hands before putting them in or taking them out. Also, make sure that you disinfect your lenses correctly with a contact lens cleaning solution.","Sties can usually be treated at home. They should go away in 7 to 10 days. Don’t try any over-the-counter medicines, drops, or ointments without talking to your family doctor first.

The following are some things you can do to help sties go away:

• Put a warm, damp compress on your eye for 5 to 10 minutes, 3 or 4 times a day. The compress should be warm but not so hot that it burns your eyelid.
• Keep the area around your eye clean.
• Avoid touching or rubbing your eye.
• Avoid wearing eye makeup or contact lenses while the sty heals.
• Never try to squeeze or pop any bumps near your eye. Doing this can spread infection.

If a sty requires medical treatment, your doctor may use antibiotics, minor surgery to drain the it, or a steroid injection to reduce swelling. Your doctor may also treat any underlying conditions that are causing your sty or making it worse.","A sty is usually a harmless condition. It may cause you some irritation, but it should go away on its own. Home treatment measures such as warm compresses can help. If a sty gets infected, you may need to take antibiotic medicine.","• What is the best treatment for me?
• Is it okay for my child to go to daycare with a sty?

You may want to feel that feeling again. But it’s not OK. In fact, it’s dangerous. Using substances like this can affect your brain. A powerful urge to use the drugs, alcohol, and tobacco can control your behavior. This can cause you to use these substances without thinking of how they will affect you. They also may affect your health, relationships, money, and performance at work or school. That’s when substance use becomes substance addiction.

You can avoid substance use disorder by only using medicines as they’re supposed to be used. Follow dosing directions from your doctor for prescription medicines. Follow drug label instructions on over-the-counter medicines. Don’t use tobacco or drink alcohol. When prescription medicines are taken the right way, there is much less chance you’ll become addicted to them. Avoid using drugs classified as “recreational” or illegal.

Substance addiction is dangerous. Sometimes it’s hard to see an addiction in yourself. It’s important to listen to loved ones who express concern about you. They may help you recognize you have a problem. You may have an addiction to drugs, alcohol, or tobacco if:

• You continue to use them even though they cause problems in your life.
• You lose interest in things you used to like to do.
• You don’t care for yourself. For example, you don’t change your clothes every day or you don’t take a shower.
• You feel tired and sad a lot.
• You’re often in a bad mood.
• You’ve developed a tolerance to drugs, alcohol, or tobacco. This means you need to use more and more to get the same “feel good” effect.

Substance addiction is different for everybody. However, you may be more likely to become addicted to drugs, alcohol, or tobacco if:

• You start using them when you’re young.
• You have mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression.
• You hang around with people who abuse drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.
• You’re having trouble at home or work.
• You have a genetic and family history of substance abuse.

If you think you have an addiction, it’s important to visit with your doctor. Don’t be afraid to tell them what drugs or alcohol you’re using, even if they’re illegal drugs. They will keep that information private. You won’t get in trouble with the police. It’s best to be honest with your doctor so they can help you. Your doctor will visit with you about your situation. They may refer you to other doctors to help, too. These may include a psychiatrist or a psychologist. These are mental health doctors. Your doctor also may refer you to a counselor who specializes in substance use disorder."
417,Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS),https://familydoctor.org/condition/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids/,"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained reason a baby under the age of 1 dies while sleeping.

When a baby dies unexpectedly, the police and a medical examiner investigate the death. They look at where the death occurred, do an autopsy on the baby, and look at the baby’s health history.

Part of the frustration of SIDS is that there are no warning",signs or symptoms. All a parent or caregiver can do is take preventive steps to reduce the chance of SIDS (see the “prevention” section in this article).,"SIDS is believed to be related to certain sleeping hazards that can cause the baby to stop breathing. These include:

• Soft bedding covering the baby’s face
• A baby getting wedged or trapped between a mattress and something else in the bed or crib
• A baby lying on their side or stomach and unable to roll over or lift their head
• An adult accidentally rolling on top of the baby while sharing a bed

Babies born with defects in the part of their brain that controls breathing and waking from sleep are more likely to die of SIDS. Respiratory infections may also increase a baby’s likeliness of dying from SIDS.

According to the Safe to Sleep® Campaign, SIDS isn’t contagious. It’s not caused by choking or vomiting, and it isn’t tied to child abuse or the lack of immunizations. It’s not the same as, or caused by, suffocation.","An infant is diagnosed as having died of SIDS after all other causes have been excluded. Professionals will try to determine the cause of death and conduct interviews with parents or caregivers. They also will check the baby’s medical records. They will examine the spot where the baby died, usually a crib or a bed. SIDS is listed as a cause of death after an autopsy.","There is no sure way to prevent SIDS, but there are ways to reduce your baby’s risks. If you are a parent or caregiver, there are ways to keep your baby’s sleep space safe:

• Remove all loose bedding, such as crib bumpers, blankets, pillows, stuffed animals, and toys. These items can cause the baby to choke or stop breathing. They also can strangle the baby.
• Make sure you have the most recent, baby-friendly crib. It should be designed to keep your baby from falling between the mattress and the side of the crib. It’s also important to make sure your baby can’t get their head stuck in the bars of the crib. While an older, used crib may be more affordable, look for a newer one to match your budget and keep your baby safe. Choose a firm crib mattress over a softer one.
• Don’t allow your baby to sleep with you, another adult, or another child. You may forget to return a fussy baby to its crib and accidentally roll on top of it. This causes the baby to stop breathing.
• Place your baby on their back (not their tummy or side) for naps and at night. A baby’s neck and muscles aren’t fully developed that would allow them to lift their head or roll over. When the baby is “stuck” on their tummy, they can’t lift their head to breathe.
• Have your baby sleep in your room but on a separate sleeping surface for at least 6 months, if not their entire first year. Sharing a room with your baby can reduce the risk of SIDS by up to 50%. It allows you to monitor the baby without bringing them into your own bed.
• Keep the room cool. Some research suggests that when a baby gets overheated, they may slip into a deeper sleep. This may result in a hard time waking up when their body is trying to tell them to breathe.

Aside from monitoring your baby’s sleep space, you should also take the following measures to prevent SIDS:

• Keep up on your baby’s vaccinations and well-child visits. Research shows that getting vaccinations on schedule reduces the threat of SIDS by 50%.
• Breastfeed your baby and use a pacifier. This has been shown to reduce the potential for SIDS.
• Keep your baby away from cigarette and other types of smoke both before and after birth.
• Avoid alcohol or drug use during pregnancy.

Premature birth or low birth weight also may be associated with SIDS. Mothers less than 20 years old also may be a factor.","SIDS can’t be treated since the death happens without warning. Your doctor, however, may be able to help you cope with your loss by recommending sources for grief counseling.","Anyone who has ever experienced the death of a baby is heartbroken, no matter what the reason. If you’re struggling with this loss, it’s important to give yourself time to heal and possibly even seek counseling. Ask your doctor for recommendations for grief and counseling services. It’s important to talk about what you are feeling and how it’s affecting your work, home, and relationships.","• Once my child is old enough to roll over, is he or she still at risk for SIDS?
• Should I wake my child up throughout the night when he or she is a newborn?
• Is there a test to determine how well my baby is breathing?
• Can allergies or asthma at a young age cause SIDS?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Sudden Unexpected Infant Death and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome

418,Syphilis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/syphilis/,"Syphilis is a serious infection passed from one person to another through sexual contact. It is caused by a bacteria (germ). You can get syphilis by touching the blood or sores of a person who has syphilis, especially sores on the person’s mouth, penis, vagina, or anus (the opening to the rectum).

Syphilis can be passed from one person to another during sex. If you got syphilis, you could also have gotten HIV or another sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. If you have a syphilis sore, it’s easier for HIV infection to get into your body through the sore. If you have syphilis, you should be tested for HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.

A simple exam and some lab tests can show if you have these infections. If you have HIV and syphilis, make sure your doctor knows about the HIV, so you can get the right treatment and continued care.","The first stage of syphilis is called primary syphilis. It usually occurs 10 days to 3 months after exposure. In men, the first sign of syphilis may be a sore on the penis. In women, the first sign may be a sore around or inside the vagina. You might not even notice the sore, because syphilis sores do not usually hurt. The sores go away after 3 to 6 weeks. You may also have enlarged lymph nodes (glands) in your groin.

If you don’t treat syphilis early, it spreads from the sore into your blood. When syphilis gets into your blood, it can move into the secondary stage and cause many problems. The most common sign is a rash. The rash is usually reddish-brown and can occur anywhere on the body (even on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet). The rash appears 2 to 10 weeks after the appearance of the sores. Other signs of secondary syphilis include fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, body aches, sores in the mouth, and fatigue.

After recovering from the secondary stage of syphilis, the disease can move into the latent stage. This stage produces no symptoms, but the infection is still present in the body.

After many years, people who have syphilis and don’t get treatment may develop the fourth stage of syphilis, called tertiary syphilis. This stage can cause problems in the brain and spinal cord. Tertiary syphilis may damage the heart and other organs, also.

Some people who have syphilis don’t have any signs of infection. In other people, the signs may be very mild. They might not even know they have it. But even if they have no signs or the signs go away on their own, the infection is still alive and can cause serious health problems many years later.",Syphilis is caused by bacteria called Treponema pallidum. You can get syphilis by having sex with an infected person (coming into direct contact with a syphilis sore). It can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy.,"A blood test can tell for sure if you have syphilis. Sometimes other tests can show how far the syphilis has spread. For example, your doctor may want to look at your spinal fluid. This is a way to see if the syphilis bacteria have spread to your nervous system.","The only way to prevent or avoid syphilis altogether is to abstain from sex, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. That is not always practical. Safe sex (using protection) lowers your chances of getting syphilis. This includes using condoms during sex and using “dental dams” during oral sex.","Syphilis can be cured with penicillin, which is an antibiotic. The penicillin is given as a shot. If you have had syphilis for 1 year or less, you only need to get 1 shot. If you have had syphilis longer than 1 year, you will need 2 or more shots. If you’re allergic to penicillin, be sure to tell your doctor.

If you have an advanced case of syphilis, you may need stronger treatment. You may get shots of penicillin every day for 10 days. This can be done in the doctor’s office or at a clinic. A few people have to go to the hospital to be treated with penicillin intravenously (through an IV).

If you’re pregnant, it’s very important to get treated right away. Syphilis can cause birth defects and even death in an unborn baby.

After your treatment, your doctor will ask you to come back several times for blood tests. These tests will show if the antibiotic killed all the syphilis bacteria.","If you have syphilis, it can be cured completely. But you may have it and not know it. Syphilis bacteria can live, inactive, in your spleen and lymph nodes for decades without your knowing it. That is why it is important to talk to your doctor, especially if you have multiple sex partners. Your doctor can test you to see if you have syphilis. The earlier the treatment, the better.","• What is the best treatment for me?
• How long will my treatment last?
• What stage of syphilis am I in?
• Have I passed syphilis on to my unborn baby?
• Is it possible to have sex with my partner without giving him/her syphilis?
• Am I at risk of developing any other diseases?
• I have a sore on my genitals. Are there any steps I can take to stop it from hurting?
• Are there any medicines or supplements I should avoid taking while I’m being treated for syphilis?","American Sexual Health Association

Then your partner can find out if they also have syphilis. If you’re not comfortable telling your sex partner, your doctor can help you. In some places, the local health department can tell sex partners that they may have syphilis and should get a test. If you wish, your name can be kept secret."
419,Teeth Grinding (Bruxism),https://familydoctor.org/condition/teeth-grinding-bruxism/,"Teeth grinding, also called bruxism, is the conscious or unconscious grinding or clenching of teeth. It happens most often in children. About 20% to 30% of children grind their teeth, usually while asleep. You may have heard your child doing it at night. Sometimes, children will grind their teeth during the day when they feel anxious. The good news is that most children will eventually stop grinding their teeth. This often happens around the time they lose their baby teeth.

Physical","symptoms are usually related to the teeth and jaw.

Teeth might look worn down or could be chipped. Grinding can wear down tooth enamel. So, the problem exposes children to future dental issues if left untreated. This could include sensitivity to hot and cold foods and drinks.

Children who grind their teeth often say they have a sore jaw. This can happen when they wake up or when they are chewing. Teeth grinding can lead to headaches, earaches, and facial pain. Excessive grinding can cause TMJ, or temporomandibular joint problems.

Teeth grinding also can be tied to emotional issues, such as:

• Anxiety
• Stress
• Tension
• Depression
• Eating disorders

Some people grind their teeth and don’t have any issues. They may not even be aware that they are doing it, especially if they do it when sleeping. Sometimes the only way people know they grind their teeth is because family members hear them doing it while they are asleep.","Doctors don’t always know what causes teeth grinding. Bruxism in children is more common in those diagnosed with a hyperactivity disorder or health issues, such as cerebral palsy. Certain medicines can also cause it. For some children, teeth grinding occurs because their teeth are not aligned properly.

In older children or adults, it may be linked to daily stress. Whether or not it causes symptoms can depend on many things. These include:

• The level of stress
• How hard you grind or clench your teeth and for how long
• Your ability to relax
• Your sleeping habits
• Whether your teeth are misaligned","A physical exam can usually tell your doctor or dentist if you or your child have been grinding your teeth. Your doctor will notice the appearance of worn teeth and enamel. Medical professionals often consider teeth grinding as a diagnosis when a patient complains of any facial or oral pain, including soreness while chewing. An exam can also rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as ear infections.","In many children, bruxism is their natural reaction to growth and development. These cases can’t be prevented. But stress-related teeth grinding in children and adults can be avoided. Setting a calming bedtime routine is the first step you can take to avoid teeth grinding. Help your child relax at night:

• Limit television and electronics several hours before bed.
• Provide calm music for them to listen to.
• Give them a warm shower or bath.
• Allow them to read or listen while you read.

Reducing stress is important. Talk with your child regularly about their feelings. Help them deal with stress. If you are suffering from bruxism, take steps to reduce stress in your life. Talk to a friend, family member, or counselor about what is causing you stress. Try to eliminate stressors if you can.","Treatment for bruxism can depend on your symptoms or the underlying cause. Some children who don’t have symptoms may not need treatment.

Some treatment options are designed to reduce grinding and clenching. Your doctor may begin by having you or your child wear a mouth guard at night. The mouth guard is specially made to fit your teeth. It’s like mouth guards used by athletes participating in contact sports. There are many types of mouth guards. They are designed to work in different ways. Some are designed to prevent damage to your teeth. Others prevent the upper and lower teeth from touching to eliminate grinding. Your doctor or dentist will help find the right kind of mouth guard for you.

If your grinding is caused by misaligned teeth, your doctor may recommend a visit to the dentist or orthodontist.

Sometimes stress is the underlying cause of your or your child’s teeth grinding. In this case, getting to the root of emotional problems can often help. For example, your doctor may talk with your child about things that worry them. This could include school, home life, or new experiences. They can try to come up with a plan to help your child be less worried and anxious. If there is no sign of improvement, or the emotional problems seem to be more serious, talk to your doctor to explore further evaluation and treatment options.","Teeth clenching or grinding is not dangerous. Most children will outgrow it. But it can cause uncomfortable symptoms that can interfere with daily life. There are steps you can take to reduce and prevent pain. Home care tips include:

• Apply wet heat or ice to sore jaw muscles.
• Massage the muscles in your neck, shoulders, and face.
• Avoid hard, dense, or chewy foods, such as nuts, bagels, or steak.
• Don’t chew gum.
• Learn physical therapy stretching exercises.
• Relax your facial muscles throughout the day.
• Reduce stress.
• Learn relaxation techniques.

If self-care steps don’t help after several weeks and you are still experiencing symptoms, call your family doctor.","• Does grinding your teeth run in the family?

420,Tennis Elbow,https://familydoctor.org/condition/tennis-elbow/,"Tennis elbow is another name for lateral epicondylitis. It occurs when the tendons that attach the muscle to the bone on the outside part of the elbow swell or tear. This weakens the elbow connection and puts great stress on the area. Tennis elbow often causes pain when you use the muscles to lift, grip, or twist.

Tennis elbow begins as an ache on the outside of your elbow. It gets worse over time until it is a severe burning pain. You may notice pain moving from the outside of your elbow to your forearm and the back of your hand when you grip, twist, or lift.

As the condition worsens, your grip may weaken. You may feel pain even when lifting light objects, such as a small book or coffee cup. Pain may increase when you press on the outside of your elbow.

In addition to pain, you may have swelling around your elbow joint.

There are things you can do at home to help relieve pain and swelling.

• Rest your arm by avoiding the movement that caused the condition.
• Take an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine that reduces swelling, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin.
• Apply an ice pack to your elbow for 15 to 20 minutes, 3 times a day.
• Wrap your elbow in a compression bandage.
• Do gentle stretching exercises several times a day.
• Try changing your sports equipment or technique.
• Try changing your work habitat and habits, or job.

Talk to your doctor if these treatments do not help. They may suggest:

• Using a splint or brace to keep your elbow still for 2 to 3 weeks.
• Getting a steroid injection to reduce swelling and pain.
• Getting a pulsed ultrasound to break up scar tissue, promote healing, and increase blood flow.

Once your pain and swelling have decreased, physical therapy can help reinforce your muscles and tendons. This includes stretching, range-of-motion, and strengthening exercises. Most people improve in 4 to 6 weeks.

If your pain does not improve or if it affects your lifestyle, your doctor may suggest surgery. Usually, surgery occurs in an outpatient center. This means you don’t have to stay in the hospital. During surgery, the doctor will make a small cut on the outside of your elbow. They will remove the damaged tendon tissue and reattach normal tendon tissue to the bone.",null,"Overuse causes most cases of tennis elbow. It occurs when repeated movements cause swelling and pain in your joint and tendons. Any type of repeated motion or stress on the tendons can cause it. Playing tennis is only one of the ways you can get tennis elbow. People who play other racquet sports, such as racquetball or squash, and fencing are at risk. Certain jobs can lead to tennis elbow. Examples include painters, butchers, carpenters, musicians, manicurists, and dentists. People who work on an assembly line or use computers are at risk as well.

In some cases, the tendons can swell after a direct blow to the elbow. In other cases, the condition isn’t related to an activity at all.

Tennis elbow can occur at any age. It is most common in people 30 to 50 years of age. It affects both men and women.","There are several things your doctor will do to diagnose tennis elbow. First, they will review your health history and lifestyle. Then, they will examine your elbow and arm to check for pain, swelling, and stiffness. They also may move your arm, elbow, wrist, and fingers. The doctor may order an X-ray or MRI of your arm. These tests help ensure you don’t have a break or fracture.","You may be able to avoid or prevent tennis elbow. It helps to maintain strength and flexibility in your wrists and arm muscles. You can do this by using light weights to strengthen and doing exercises to stretch. This is especially important for people whose sports or jobs put them at risk. Make sure you warm up your elbow, wrist, and arm before activity. Try to avoid repetitive movements. Wearing a splint during activities may help prevent the condition from getting worse.",null,"Most people recover from tennis elbow after treatment. You may need physical therapy or a brace to help manage ongoing symptoms or prevent them from coming back.

• The pain does not improve or gets worse.
• The area becomes red or swollen.
• You have trouble moving your arm.
• You see a lump or bulge on your arm.","• What caused my tennis elbow?

421,Testicular Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/testicular-cancer/,"Testicular cancer occurs in one or both of a person’s testicles. The testicles are located in the scrotum (the skin sac that hangs beneath your penis). Testicles can vary in size and are round, smooth, and firm. They produce male hormones and sperm.

Testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer in young and middle-aged, white men. It can occur in older men, as well. In rare cases, it can occur in younger boys. Black and Asian men are less likely to develop it.","The most common sign of testicular cancer is a hard, painless lump on the testicle. Other symptoms include:

• Pain or a dull ache in your scrotum
• Enlarged testicle
• Swelling of your scrotum
• Heavy feeling in your scrotum
• Pain in your lower back or stomach
• Tender or enlarged breasts",Cancer is caused by abnormal cell growth. Most cases of testicular cancer are caused by germ cells. These are cells that make sperm. There is no evidence linking testicular cancer to a vasectomy.,"Early detection is important. Regular, self-examinations may be your first clue. Contact your doctor if you notice something unusual. Your doctor will perform a physical exam. He or she will feel your scrotum and testicles for lumps. Your doctor may do a transillumination test. This is done by shining a light to your scrotum. If the light does not pass through a lump, it could be cancerous. Not all lumps or tumors are cancerous. To confirm cancer, your doctor will do other tests. These may include a blood test, ultrasound, X-ray, or computed tomography (CT) scan. If you have cancer, your doctor will check to see what type and stage it is. There are two types of testicular cancer. Seminoma cancer grows slowly. Nonseminoma cancer grows quickly. You may have a combination of the two","You cannot prevent or avoid testicular cancer. Although this type of cancer is rare. Risk factors include: • A family history of testicular cancer • Caucasian (white) descent • Having an undescended testicle (This means the testicle did not drop down into your scrotum. The risk exists even if you had surgery to correct that.) • Small or misshaped testicles • Having an HIV infection • Klinefelter syndrome (a rare disorder in which a man has an extra X chromosome) Treatment depends on your type and stage of cancer. Your general health also is important. Most men who have testicular cancer will require surgery. This involves removing the cancerous testicle. You may need other treatments. If your cancer is severe, has spread, or reoccurs, you may need radiation or chemotherapy. Radiation kills cancer cells using X-rays or radio waves. Chemotherapy kills cancer cells with powerful medicines. Testicular cancer is treatable and curable. Early detection improves your outcome. You can still have children with one testicle. Removing both testicles means you will be infertile. You may be able to store your sperm before treatment. Talk to your doctor about regular exams and concerns after treatment.

422,Testicular Torsion,https://familydoctor.org/condition/testicular-torsion/,"Testicular torsion happens when testicles rotate and the spermatic cord becomes twisted. The spermatic cord supports the testes in the scrotum. When the cord twists, the blood supply to the testicle is cut off. If it’s not treated quickly, the testicle can die and will have to be removed. Or it can become so damaged it won’t work properly anymore.

423,Thalassemia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/thalassemia/,"Thalassemia is a group of inherited blood disorders that prevent your body from producing the amount of hemoglobin it needs. Hemoglobin is located within your red blood cells. It’s what carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Not having enough hemoglobin also leads to anemia. This medical condition makes you feel tired, weak, and short of breath.

There are two main types of thalassemia:

• Alpha thalassemia: Missing or mutated genes related to the alpha globin protein.
• Beta thalassemia (also called Cooley anemia): Gene defects that affect production of beta globin protein.

Inheriting the gene from both parents is called thalassemia major. Inheriting it from one parent is called thalassemia minor. Most carriers (people who have the gene but do not have the disorder) are symptom free.","Thalassemia symptoms depend on the type of thalassemia you have and the severity of the anemia. Some people have little or even no symptoms. Other people have mild to severe symptoms. Symptoms of thalassemia may include one or more of the following:

• Paleness.
• Tiredness, low energy, or muscle weakness (also called fatigue).
• Lightheadedness or shortness of breath.
• Lack of appetite.
• Dark urine.
• Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes).
• In children, slow growth and delayed puberty.
• Bone deformities in the face.
• Abdominal swelling.

Alpha thalassemia can be harmful to pregnant women. It can lead to a stillborn birth.

Children who are born with thalassemia may show signs of the disease right away, or symptoms may appear later. Most signs and symptoms usually show up within the first 2 years of life. If your child has delayed growth, it’s important to find out if he or she might have thalassemia. Untreated thalassemia can cause heart failure and infection.

Thalassemia can lead to other health problems:

• An enlarged spleen. Your spleen helps your body fight infections and filters out damaged blood cells. If you have thalassemia, your spleen may have to work harder than normal, which can cause it to enlarge. If your spleen becomes too large, it may have to be removed.
• Infections. People who have thalassemia are more likely to get blood infections, especially if they have a lot of blood transfusions. Some types of infection can be worse if you’ve had your spleen removed.
• Bone problems. Thalassemia can cause bone deformities in the face and skull. People who have thalassemia may also have severe osteoporosis (brittle bones).
• Too much iron in your blood. This can cause damage to the heart, liver, or endocrine system (glands in the body that make hormones, like the thyroid gland and adrenal glands).","Thalassemia is an inherited gene mutation. It is passed on from one or both parents.

The type of thalassemia you have depends on which mutated genes you inherit from your parents, and how many genes you inherit.

• Alpha thalassemia: Involves 4 genes (you get 2 of these genes from your mother and 2 of these genes from your father). If you only get 1 mutated gene, you will have no signs or symptoms of thalassemia. However, you can still pass on the gene mutation to your children (this is called being a “carrier”). If you get 2 mutated genes, you will have mild symptoms. If you get 3, you’ll have moderate to severe symptoms. A baby who inherits all 4 mutated genes will be very sick, and probably won’t live long after birth.
• Beta thalassemia: Involves 2 genes (you get 1 gene from your mother and 1 gene from your father). If you get only 1 mutated gene, you’ll have mild signs or symptoms of thalassemia. If you get 2 mutated genes, you’ll have moderate to severe symptoms that usually develop in the first 2 years of life.","If your doctor thinks you or your child might have thalassemia, he’ll do a physical exam and ask about your medical history. Thalassemia can only be diagnosed with blood tests. Doctors use several different types of blood tests to look for thalassemia. Some tests measure the number and size of red blood cells, or the amount of iron in the blood. Others look at the hemoglobin within the red blood cells. DNA testing helps doctors identify which genes are missing or damaged.","The only way to prevent an inherited condition, such as thalassemia, in your child is not to become pregnant.","Treatment for thalassemia depends on which type of thalassemia you have and the severity of your symptoms. If you have no or only mild symptoms, you may need little or no treatment.

Treatment for moderate to severe forms of thalassemia often includes regular blood transfusions and folate supplements. Folate (also called folic acid) helps your body make healthy blood cells. Alpha thalassemia can sometimes be mistaken for low-iron anemia, and iron supplements may be recommended as a treatment. But iron supplements have no effect on thalassemia.

If you have many blood transfusions, too much iron may build up in your blood. If this happens, you will need chelation therapy to remove extra iron from your body. You shouldn’t take iron supplements if you receive blood transfusions.

In the most severe cases, bone marrow or stem cell transplants may help by replacing damaged cells with healthy ones from a donor. A donor is usually a relative such as a sibling.","Although you can’t prevent inheriting thalassemia, you can manage the disease so you can have the best quality of life possible. Key steps include:

• Follow your treatment plan. Get blood transfusions as often as your doctor recommends. Make sure to take your iron chelation medicine and/or folic acid supplements.
• Get ongoing medical care. Have regular medical checkups and get the medical tests your doctor suggests. These may include tests relating to thalassemia, as well as your overall health. Be sure to get any vaccinations for flu, pneumonia, hepatitis B, and meningitis that your doctor recommends.
• Take care of yourself. Eat healthy and stay hydrated. Lower your chance of getting an infection by washing your hands often, and avoiding crowds during flu and cold season. Keep the area around your transfusion site clean. Call your doctor if you develop a fever or other signs of infection.
• Look for information and support. Join a support group or talk with others who have the disease to learn coping strategies. Be sure to discuss any changes in your treatment plan with your doctor.","• How can I tell is I am a thalassemia carrier?

• Alpha thalassemia most often affects people who are of Southeast Asian, Indian, Chinese, or Filipino descent.
• Beta thalassemia most often affects people who are of Mediterranean (Greek, Italian and Middle Eastern), Asian, or African descent.

Severe types of thalassemia can cause a stillbirth during a woman’s pregnancy. If you or your partner knows you are a carrier for thalassemia, talk to your doctor or a genetic counselor before getting pregnant. Certain tests may be able to show which type of thalassemia you are carrying. Once you are pregnant, prenatal testing can show whether or not your baby has thalassemia."
424,Thyroid Nodules,https://familydoctor.org/condition/thyroid-nodules/,"The thyroid is a small gland located at the base of your throat (near your Adam’s apple). It regulates body functions such as heart rate, metabolism, and the rate at which your body burns calories. A thyroid nodule is a lump in the thyroid gland in your neck. More than 90% of all thyroid nodules are benign (non-cancerous). Some are cysts filled with fluid.

Thyroid nodules are more common in women than in men. They also tend to run in families. They are sometimes associated with the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This condition is a common cause of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), which affects your body’s ability to maintain an efficient metabolism and burn calories.","Most thyroid nodules don’t cause symptoms. For people who do have symptoms, they may have trouble swallowing or breathing or have a feeling of fullness, pain, or pressure in the throat or neck. Some people might notice a lump in their neck when they look in the mirror, but this is uncommon. Some people experience rapid unintended weight loss, feelings of nervousness, or an irregular heartbeat.","Doctors aren’t always sure why some people get thyroid nodules, but they’re very common. The chances of getting one increase as you get older. Almost 50% of adults will develop thyroid nodules by the time they’re 60 years old.

The nodules are sometimes associated with other medical conditions, including:

• Iodine deficiency
• Hyperthyroidism(overactive thyroid)
• Hashimoto’s disease (hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid)
• Cancer","Often, a doctor finds the lump during a routine checkup or during other tests. They can feel it.","Doctors aren’t sure what causes most thyroid nodules, so most likely, you can’t prevent them. But you can make sure you eat enough food that contains iodine (table salt, dairy products, seafood, meat, etc.), which can prevent one cause of thyroid nodules.","Some patients who have small benign nodules may choose watchful waiting. This isn’t a form of active treatment but rather an observation period. The nodule may go away on its own or stay the same size. Patients treated this way should be checked by their doctor every 6 months to monitor the growth of the nodule. As long as the nodule does not grow, there’s usually no need to worry.

Other forms of treatment include taking hormones or radioactive iodine to shrink the nodules or injecting the nodules with ethyl alcohol (ethanol) to shrink the nodules. If a nodule is cancerous or grows despite hormone pill treatment, surgery to remove the nodule may be needed.","Most people who have thyroid nodules lead a normal life. You might need to check in with your doctor more often, but there usually are no complications.

If you do have complications, they can include problems swallowing or breathing. You may also sustain significant weight gain or weight loss. Work with your doctor to treat these symptoms.

If your thyroid nodules are a symptom of thyroid cancer, you may need surgery. During the surgery, the doctor will remove most, if not all, of your thyroid. Following the surgery, you’ll take daily thyroid replacement hormones for the rest of your life.","• Is my thyroid nodule cancer?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Your doctor can do several different tests. One test is called fine-needle aspiration. Your doctor will take a tissue sample from your thyroid gland and examine it under a microscope to see if it’s cancerous. The tissue sample is taken with a very small needle.

Another test your doctor may do is an ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the thyroid’s shape and the size of the nodules. It can help your doctor determine whether the nodule is a solid tumor or a cyst filled with fluid.

A third test is a thyroid scan. Your doctor will inject harmless radioactive iodine into a vein in your arm. The iodine is absorbed by your thyroid gland and makes it “glow” as your doctor takes a special picture. Your doctor can learn about the nodule depending on how much or how little of the iodine shows in the picture.

Additionally, your doctor may order a lab test (blood draw) to check your thyroid hormone levels."
425,Thyroiditis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/thyroiditis/,"Thyroiditis refers to a group of disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid. Your thyroid is the gland located in the front of your neck below your Adam’s apple. The thyroid makes hormones that control your metabolism and affect how your body works. Metabolism is how your body processes substances to produce energy or burn calories.

There are several types of thyroiditis:

• The cause is antibodies that attack the thyroid.
• Symptoms are those of hypothyroidism.
• Hypothyroidism is permanent but can be treated.

Subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain’s thyroiditis)

• The possible cause is a viral infection.
• Symptoms include pain in the thyroid and those of hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism.
• Symptoms improve within a few months.
• Hypothyroidism is rarely permanent but can be treated.

Acute thyroiditis (suppurative thyroiditis)

• The cause is bacteria or infection.
• Symptoms include pain in the thyroid, mild illness, and those of hypothyroidism.
• Symptoms improve after treatment of the infectious cause.

• The cause may be antibodies that attack the thyroid or an autoimmune disorder.
• Symptoms are those of hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism.
• Symptoms improve within 12 to 18 months.
• Hypothyroidism may be permanent but can be treated.

• The cause is antibodies that attack the thyroid after delivery of a child.
• Symptoms of hyperthyroidism appear 1 to 3 months after delivery. Symptoms of hypothyroidism begin about 4 to 8 months after delivery.
• Symptoms improve within 12 to 18 months.
• Hypothyroidism may be permanent but can be treated.

• The cause is use of radioactive iodine for treatment of hyperthyroidism or radiation therapy for treatment of certain cancers.
• Symptoms are those of hypothyroidism.
• Hyperthyroidism may get better but then come back. Hypothyroidism often is permanent but can be treated.

• The cause is the use of prescription drugs, such as amiodarone, lithium, interferons, and cytokines.
• Symptoms are those of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
• Symptoms continue as long as the drug is taken.","Thyroiditis symptoms vary since it is a group of disorders with several types.

Thyroiditis can trigger rapid thyroid cell damage. This causes thyroid hormone to leak into your blood and increases thyroid hormone levels. When this happens, you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). Possible symptoms are:

• Weight loss
• Nervousness, anxiety, or irritability
• Trouble sleeping
• Rapid heart rate
• Fatigue
• Muscle weakness
• Tremors (shaking hands or fingers)
• Diarrhea or loose stools

Thyroiditis also can lead to slow, long-term thyroid cell damage. This causes thyroid hormone levels in your blood to be low. When this happens, you have symptoms of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). Possible symptoms are:

• Unplanned weight gain
• Fatigue
• Constipation
• Dry skin
• Depression
• Muscle aches

People who have thyroiditis also may have pain and swelling in the thyroid gland (in the front of the neck).","The cause of thyroiditis depends on the type of disease you have. Most types occur when your immune system attacks the thyroid gland. This causes inflammation (the body’s response to injury) and damages the thyroid cells. The reason for the attack often is an autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto’s.

Other types of thyroiditis occur from use of radiation or certain medicines. Viral or bacterial infections also may cause thyroiditis.","Lab tests often can diagnose thyroiditis, including what type you have. Your doctor will start with a blood test. This measures the amount of thyroid hormone in your blood. It will show if your hormone levels are too high or too low. Blood tests check your level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as well. TSH is produced in the pituitary gland and can affect your thyroid hormone levels. Blood tests also can show if you have antibodies present in your body.

Your doctor may do a radioactive iodine uptake test. This measures your thyroid’s ability to absorb iodine, a mineral that is needed to produce thyroid hormone.

In some cases, you may need a biopsy to determine what is attacking the thyroid.","Most cases of thyroiditis cannot be prevented. If you have a health issue that requires treatment using radioactive iodine or radiation therapy, talk to your doctor about your risk of thyroiditis. You may be able to start with other treatments to avoid your chance of thyroiditis. If you take prescription drugs that can cause thyroiditis, talk to your doctor about your risk and if you can stop taking them. You still may not be able to avoid thyroiditis.","Treatment for thyroiditis depends on your type and what symptoms you have.

If you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called a beta blocker. This helps to lower your heart rate and reduce tremors. Since hyperthyroidism often is temporary, your doctor likely will taper the dose of this medicine as your symptoms improve.

If you have symptoms of hypothyroidism, your doctor may prescribe thyroid hormone replacements. These help to restore your body’s hormone levels and get your metabolism back to normal. It can take several tries to get the right dose of synthetic thyroid hormone. If you have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, you will likely have to take this medicine for the rest of your life. The hypothyroidism from Hashimoto’s is usually permanent.

Talk to your doctor if you have pain in your thyroid. They may recommend a mild anti-inflammatory, such as aspirin or ibuprofen to manage the pain. Severe thyroid pain may require treatment with steroid therapy.","Thyroiditis and its symptoms may be temporary. In this case, you will be able to live a normal life following treatment. If the condition returns or is permanent, work with your doctor to manage symptoms.

If you do not get treatment, damage to your thyroid may continue and could lead to more health issues. For women, you may have problems with fertility or your children could be born with birth defects.

Low functioning thyroid can lead to heart conditions, elevated cholesterol, swelling, and other conditions in both men and women.","• What type of thyroiditis do I have?
• What is the likely cause of my thyroiditis?
• What are the results of my blood test(s)? What do these results mean?
• Will I need to take medicine? If so, for how long and what are the side effects?

426,Tick-Borne Relapsing Fever,https://familydoctor.org/condition/tick-borne-relapsing-fever/,"Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a bacterial infection spread by ticks. The infection normally shows up as repeated episodes of fever, along with headache, muscle and joint aches, and nausea. It occurs in the western United States. It is usually associated with sleeping in rustic cabins in mountainous areas.

Though not common, it is possibly for untreated TBRF to cause serious health problems, even death.","The main symptom of TBRF is a sudden fever that comes on within 2 weeks of being bitten by a tick. Multiple bouts of fever happen. Each can last about 3 days. The fever then goes away for about 1 week before returning. If left untreated, the cycle can continue several times.

Some other symptoms of TBRF may include:

• Headache
• Chills
• Sweats
• Muscle or joint aches
• Nausea
• Vomiting

In some cases, the fever ends in a “crisis” stage. This consists of shaking chills, intense sweating, falling body temperature, and low blood pressure.","In the United States, TBRF is usually caused by a bite from certain types of ticks. These ticks, called “soft” ticks, carry the Borrelia bacteria. They are typically found in higher elevations of the western states. This includes the mountains of the West and the high deserts and plains of the Southwest.

Soft ticks behave differently than “hard” ticks, such as dog ticks or deer ticks:

• Their bite is brief, usually lasting less than half an hour.
• They don’t search for prey in tall grass or brush. Instead, they live in the nests of rodents and small animals. They feed on the rodent as it sleeps.

TBRF is often associated with sleeping in rustic cabins. The soft ticks live in the nests of rodents that live in the cabin’s walls, attics, or crawl spaces. The ticks come out at night briefly to feed. The bites are quick and painless. You usually don’t know you’ve been bitten.","TBRF and other tick-borne diseases can be diagnosed with a blood test. If you have been exposed to ticks and you are having repeated episodes of fever, call your doctor right away.","The best ways to prevent getting TBRF are to:

• Be careful when choosing a cabin or building to sleep in. Look for evidence of rodents. This could include nests or droppings. Avoid staying in buildings where you see these signs of infestation.
• Use an insect repellent with at least 20% DEET. It can be put on clothing or sparingly on the skin. Don’t apply it to the face or hands of children.
• Treat clothing, tents, or other gear with repellents containing 0.5% permethrin.

You can prevent other tick-borne diseases by avoiding being bitten by ticks. When you are outdoors, follow these guidelines:

• Avoid areas that are wooded, brushy, or have tall grass.
• Walk in the center of trails.
• Wear light-colored clothing. This makes it easier to see and remove ticks from your clothes.
• Wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Tuck your pant legs into your socks or boots for added protection.

After you get home, check everything and everyone for ticks.

• Bathe or shower as soon as you can to wash off any ticks that have not attached to you.
• Check your entire body for ticks. Use a mirror for places you can’t see. Check your children and your pets. Common tick locations include the back of the knees, groin area, underarms, ears, scalp, and the back of the neck.
• Check any gear you used, including coats, backpacks, or tents.
• Tumble dry clothes or blankets on high heat in the dryer for 10 to 15 minutes. This should kill any ticks. If clothes are dirty, wash them in hot water and dry on high heat for 60 minutes.","If you have TBRF, your doctor will most likely prescribe antibiotics to fight the bacteria. It is important that you take all of your antibiotic medicine as your doctor prescribes, even if you are feeling better. This will ensure that you get rid of the disease completely. It also helps prevent building up a resistance to antibiotics.","If treated early, many people with TBRF are cured with the antibiotics. They don’t have any lasting effects from the illness. But some people experience complications. These can include:

• Drooping of the face
• Heart inflammation
• Inflammation around the brain and spinal cord
• Liver problems
• Pneumonia
• Seizures
• Widespread bleeding
• Death

It is very important to see your doctor right away if you think you may have TBRF. Early treatment can prevent complications and improve your outlook for recovery.","• I’ve been bitten by a tick. Do I need any treatment?
• Which form of treatment is best for me
• Is there anything I can do to avoid developing complications?
• What tick or insect repellent should I use for my child?
• Which tick or insect repellent is best for me?
• I have HIV. Should I avoid areas where ticks may live?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Tick-borne Relapsing Fever (TBRF)

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","People at highest risk for TBRF are those who stay in rustic cabins in the mountainous areas of the West where soft ticks live. You are also at risk for TBRF if you have had a tick bite or if you have found any ticks on your body in the past 3 weeks. People who spend time outdoors in areas where ticks are common, either for work or recreation, are at higher risk of getting any tick-borne disease.

Don’t panic. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible. Pull up with steady, even pressure. Be careful not to squeeze or twist the tick body. Sometimes parts of the tick remain in the skin. You can leave them alone or carefully remove them the same way you would a splinter. Do not use heat (such as a lit match), petroleum jelly, or other methods to try to make the tick “back out” on its own. These methods are not effective.

Wash the area where the tick was attached thoroughly with soap and water. Keep an eye on the area for a few weeks and note any changes. Call your doctor if you develop a fever or other symptoms of TBRF. Be sure to tell your doctor that you were bitten by a tick and when it happened."
427,Tinnitus: Causes and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/tinnitus/,"Tinnitus causes a persistent ringing, buzzing, or hissing sound in the ears—and it can affect your focus, sleep, and overall well-being. While it’s not a disease itself, tinnitus often signals an underlying issue. Learning about tinnitus causes and treatment can help you understand what’s triggering the noise and what options are available to manage or reduce it.

Tinnitus is a problem that causes you hear a noise in one ear or both ears. In most cases, nothing outside of you caused that noise. It’s an internal noise that only you hear in your ear.","The main symptom of tinnitus is hearing sounds in your ears that aren’t really there. The sound could be ringing. It may also sound like blowing, roaring, clicking, buzzing, hissing, or humming. The noises can be soft or loud. They can be high pitched or low pitched.","Tinnitus is not a disease. It’s a symptom of an underlying health problem. There are many possible explanations for tinnitus, so understanding common tinnitus causes and treatment options can help you and your doctor identify the best path forward. Here are some common causes of tinnitus:

Certain medicines can damage the inner workings of the ear (for example, taking high doses of aspirin every day).","Your doctor will take a detailed medical history, including a family history of hearing loss. They will want to know about any medical conditions you may have and any history of infections. Your doctor also needs to know what medicines you’re taking, including herbal products or supplements. They will check your ears and may give you a hearing test. They may also order other tests to find out what is causing your tinnitus. These could include a head CT scan, a head MRI scan, or blood vessel studies. Your doctor might refer you to an otolaryngologist. This is a doctor that specializes in the ear, nose, and throat (also called an ENT doctor).","To prevent tinnitus or keep it from getting worse, avoid long-term exposure to loud noises and activities that put you at risk for hearing loss. If you know you’re going to be around loud noises, take precautions by wearing earplugs or noise-canceling headphones. Keep the volume low if you listen to music through headphones.

Avoid things that seem to make your tinnitus worse, such as nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine.","Treatment will depend on what is causing your tinnitus. If earwax is causing your tinnitus, your doctor will remove it. If a medicine you’re taking is causing the issue, your doctor may recommend you stop taking that medicine. But never stop taking a prescription medicine without talking to your doctor first.

If an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, is causing your tinnitus, your doctor can create a treatment plan for you to follow. Usually, tinnitus goes away once the condition that is causing it is treated. If diabetes is causing your tinnitus, take your prescribed medicine and follow your doctor’s orders for diet and exercise to manage the condition.

When no specific cause can be identified, your doctor will probably focus on making your tinnitus easier to tolerate.

• Hearing aids: For people who have tinnitus and hearing loss, using a hearing aid may be helpful. When you wear a hearing aid, things you need to hear will be louder than the ringing, buzzing, or clicking sound. Hearing aids are available by prescription or over the counter. Talk to your doctor about which is best for you.
• Sound generators (maskers): Wearable sound generators can be placed behind your ear and create white noise (constant background noise) or other sounds. This “masks” the tinnitus and makes it less noticeable. Some people also use bedside sound generators to help them sleep.
• Counseling: Some people who have tinnitus become anxious or depressed because a hearing loss can isolate a person, socially. If you have tinnitus and are struggling, seek help through a counselor and/or a support group to help you cope. Counseling can also be used to help you take the focus off your tinnitus.
• Tinnitus retraining therapy: This method uses a mix of counseling with maskers or other approaches. The goal is to teach your brain to ignore the sounds you hear. This isn’t a quick fix, but many people find it useful with time and practice.

• Medicines: Currently, there are no medicines specifically designed for treating tinnitus. Some medicines, such as certain ones used to treat anxiety, have been shown to relieve tinnitus for some people. Talk to your doctor about whether medicine might relieve your symptoms.
• Relaxing: Stress can make tinnitus worse. Your doctor can suggest relaxation techniques that might help you deal with your stress.

While there’s no universal cure, many people find relief by working with their doctor to explore personalized tinnitus causes and treatment strategies","For many people with tinnitus, the condition is just a mild distraction. But for some, tinnitus causes distress and negatively affects their quality of life. It can cause anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and poor concentration. To lessen the impact of tinnitus on your life, try the following:

• Avoid loud noises and sounds.
• Control your blood pressure and diabetes.
• Exercise regularly for good circulation.
• Get plenty of sleep and avoid fatigue.

Take the focus off your tinnitus. Use techniques such as sound generators and counseling to push it to the background. Remember that the more you think about tinnitus, the more bothersome it will become.","• The noise in my ears makes it hard for me to sleep. What can I do?
• What are the tinnitus causes and treatment options?
• Will I lose my hearing?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","People commonly describe the noise as a “ringing in the ear.” It also can be roaring, clicking, buzzing, or other sounds. Some people who have tinnitus hear a more complex noise that changes over time. You may hear the noise constantly, or it may come and go.

There are two types of tinnitus.

• Subjective tinnitus happens when you hear a sound that’s not really there. These phantom sounds are caused by certain nerves that aren’t functioning properly or because there is a problem with part of your ear.
• Objective tinnitus is caused by an actual sound that occurs inside or near the ear, such as from nearby blood vessels. Your doctor can hear this sound during an exam. This type of tinnitus rare.

Most of the time, tinnitus is caused by sensorineural hearing loss (nerve damage in your ear). Sometimes it’s caused by something as simple as earwax blocking the ear canal. Other causes include:

• Exposure to loud noises, which can lead to noise-induced hearing loss over time
• Hearing loss related to aging

• Eustachian tube dysfunction (the tube that leads from the middle ear to the back of the throat)
• Inner ear infections, such as otitis media or labyrinthitis
• Meniere’s disease, an inner-ear condition that involves hearing loss and dizziness

Allergies, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, diabetes, tumors, and head injuries can also cause tinnitus. If you have a foreign object in your ear or a build-up of ear wax, you may also experience tinnitus.

In many cases, the cause of tinnitus can’t be identified."
428,Tobacco Addiction,https://familydoctor.org/condition/tobacco-addiction/,"It’s no secret that smoking or chewing tobacco is dangerous for your health. Many people try to quit and are successful. Still, many others try to quit and fail. That may be due to the addictive nature of smoking or chewing tobacco. It can cause changes in your body and in the way you act. The changes in your body are caused by an addiction to nicotine. That’s the main ingredient in tobacco products. These changes may have occurred gradually over time and become habits.

When you have a tobacco habit, many things seem to go along with having a cigarette or a dip or chew. These might include having a cup of coffee or an alcoholic drink, being stressed or worried, talking on the phone, driving, socializing with friends, or wanting something to do with your hands or mouth.

You also may be facing pressures from friends who use tobacco products. Don’t let anyone or anything convince you that it’s okay to smoke or chew. If you need help saying no, talk to someone you can trust, like a teacher, counselor, your family doctor, or the 800-QUITNOW hotline.

Wanting to quit is a good first step. You’ll have the best chance of stopping if you do the following:

• Prepare.
• Get support and encouragement.
• Learn how to handle stress and the urge to use tobacco.
• Get medication and use it correctly.
• Be prepared for relapse.
• Keep trying.

Steps to make quitting easier include:

• Pick a stop date. Choose a date 2 to 4 weeks from today so you can get ready to quit. If possible, choose a time when things in your life will change, like when you’re about to start a break from school. Or just pick a time when you don’t expect any extra stress at school, work, or home.
• Make a list of the reasons why you want to quit. Keep the list on hand so you can look at it when you have a nicotine craving.
• Keep track of where, when, and why you use tobacco. You may want to make notes for a week or so to know ahead of time when and why you crave a cigarette or chew. Plan what you’ll do instead. You may also want to plan what you’ll say to people who pressure you to use tobacco products.
• Throw away all your tobacco. Clean out your room if you have smoked there. Throw away your ashtrays and lighters—anything that you connect with your smoking habit. Get rid of all old chewing tobacco containers and anything else you used.
• Tell your friends that you’re quitting. Ask them not to pressure you about quitting. Find other things to do with them besides smoking or using chewing tobacco.
• When your stop date arrives, stop. Reward yourself for each tobacco-free day, week, or month. For example, buy yourself a new shirt or ask a friend to see a movie with you.

Nicotine replacement products provide nicotine without using tobacco. These products are available as gum, a patch, nasal spray, an inhaler, and lozenges. You can buy the nicotine gum, patch, and lozenge without a prescription from your doctor. Nicotine replacement works by reducing your body’s craving for nicotine. This reduces withdrawal","symptoms. It lets you focus on the changes you need to make in your habits and environment. Once you feel more confident as a nonsmoker, dealing with your nicotine addiction is easier.

Some prescription medicines help people stop smoking. These medicines do not contain nicotine, but help you resist your urges to smoke. Ask your doctor for his or her recommendation.

Tell your family and friends how to help. Their support will make it easier for you to quit.

Reward yourself for stopping. For example, with the money you save by not buying tobacco products, buy yourself something special.

You may have a habit of using tobacco to relax during stressful times. Luckily, there are good ways to manage stress without smoking or chewing. Relax by taking a hot bath, going for a walk, or breathing slowly and deeply. Think of changes in your daily routine that will help you resist the urge to smoke. For example, if you used to smoke when you drank coffee, drink hot tea instead.

You may feel irritable. You also may get angry or upset faster, have trouble concentrating, and feel hungrier than usual. You may have headaches and cough more at first (while your lungs are clearing out). All of these can be symptoms of withdrawal from nicotine. The worst symptoms will stop in a few days. However, you may still have cravings for tobacco. Those cravings have less to do with nicotine addiction and more to do with the habit of smoking or using chewing tobacco.

Some people gain weight when they stop smoking. The main reason some people gain weight is because they eat more food as a substitute for smoking or chewing. You can avoid gaining weight by watching how much you eat, staying busy, and working out. Other people may lose weight when they stop smoking.

Most people try to quit more than once before they succeed. Don’t give up if you slip. Remind yourself of why you want to quit. Think about what happened to make you slip. Figure out how you’ll handle that situation differently next time. Then start again.

Tips to help you quit smoking.

Smoking causes lung cancer and many other types of cancer, heart disease, serious breathing problems, stomach ulcers and acid reflux, gum disease, and damage to babies of pregnant women who smoke. Smoking can also cost you time lost working or having fun because you’re sick. Chewing tobacco is just as bad as cigarette smoke. You may hear more about the harm cigarettes do to the body but chewing tobacco can hurt your health. Additionally:

• Cigarettes contain tar, carbon monoxide, and chemicals like DDT (pesticide), arsenic, and formaldehyde (a gas used to preserve dead animals). Tar and carbon monoxide cause serious breathing problems. Tobacco smoke also causes cancer.
• Nicotine is addictive. Nicotine raises your risk of heart attack and stroke.
• Smoking just a few cigarettes a day is bad for your health. Once you start smoking, it’s hard to stop.
• Chewing tobacco can cause sores and white patches in your mouth. Also, it can cause diseases and cancers of the mouth, gums, and throat. It can give you bad breath, discolor your teeth, and cause tooth loss. One chew contains 15 times the nicotine of a cigarette (meaning the risk of addiction is much higher).
• Smoking can shorten your life by as much as 14 years.
• Smoking gives you bad breath, makes your clothes and hair smell bad, makes your skin wrinkle more easily, makes you tired more quickly when you exercise, raises your heartbeat and your blood pressure, weakens your immune system, negatively affects your sexual performance, and weakens your tendons and ligaments.

Quitting smoking is important. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) supports health coverage for evidence-based treatment of tobacco use. Additionally, the AAFP recommends that all tobacco users in the United States be aware of the existence of such treatments and have access to all evidenced-based FDA-approved therapies and counseling.

If you smoke or chew tobacco, you should see a doctor immediately. Your family doctor can help you develop a plan to stop using tobacco. He or she can give you information on telephone hotlines or self-help materials. Your doctor can recommend a stop-smoking program. These programs are often held at local hospitals or health centers.",null,null,null,null,null,"• Is it more difficult to quit smoking the longer you’ve smoked?

Many people try to quit and are successful. Still, many others try to quit and fail. That may be due to the addictive nature of smoking or chewing tobacco. It can cause changes in your body and in the way you act. The changes in your body are caused by an addiction to nicotine. That’s the main ingredient in tobacco products. These changes may have occurred gradually over time and become habits.

When you have a tobacco habit, many things seem to go along with having a cigarette or a dip or chew. These might include having a cup of coffee or an alcoholic drink, being stressed or worried, talking on the phone, driving, socializing with friends, or wanting something to do with your hands or mouth.

You also may be facing pressures from friends who use tobacco products. Don’t let anyone or anything convince you that it’s okay to smoke or chew. If you need help saying no, talk to someone you can trust, like a teacher, counselor, your family doctor, or the 800-QUITNOW hotline.

Wanting to quit is a good first step. You’ll have the best chance of stopping if you do the following:

• Prepare.
• Get support and encouragement.
• Learn how to handle stress and the urge to use tobacco.
• Get medication and use it correctly.
• Be prepared for relapse.
• Keep trying.

Steps to make quitting easier include:

• Pick a stop date. Choose a date 2 to 4 weeks from today so you can get ready to quit. If possible, choose a time when things in your life will change, like when you’re about to start a break from school. Or just pick a time when you don’t expect any extra stress at school, work, or home.
• Make a list of the reasons why you want to quit. Keep the list on hand so you can look at it when you have a nicotine craving.
• Keep track of where, when, and why you use tobacco. You may want to make notes for a week or so to know ahead of time when and why you crave a cigarette or chew. Plan what you’ll do instead. You may also want to plan what you’ll say to people who pressure you to use tobacco products.

429,Tonsillitis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/tonsillitis/,"Tonsillitis is an inflammatory disease. It occurs when your tonsils become infected by a virus or bacteria. Tonsils are the oval-shaped areas of pink tissue at the back of your throat. There are two tonsils, one on each side. They help fight infection by reacting to germs that enter through your nose and mouth. Infected tonsils become inflamed and swollen.

Tonsillitis is more common in children than adults.

Swollen tonsils often are the first sign of tonsillitis. It may feel like your throat or neck glands are swollen. Other tonsillitis","symptoms may include:

• Redness
• Sore throat
• White or yellow spots or film on your tonsils
• Trouble swallowing
• Fever
• Chills
• Bad breath
• Ear pain
• Headache
• Hoarse voice or loss of voice (laryngitis)
• Trouble sleeping or sleep apnea (when breathing stops briefly during sleep)

Children who have tonsillitis may have stomach pain. This is more common when strep is the cause of tonsillitis.

Contact your doctor if your child has symptoms of tonsillitis. This includes:

• A sore throat that lasts more than two days (with or without a fever or stomach pain)
• A fever above 103°F
• Extreme illness, fatigue, or weakness
• Labored breathing or swallowing

If your child can’t breathe or is drooling because they can’t swallow, get emergency care right away.","Viral infections cause most cases of tonsillitis. For example, the virus that causes mononucleosis, or mono, (called the Epstein-Barr virus) can cause tonsillitis. Bacterial infections only cause tonsillitis about 15% to 30% of the time. The main bacteria are a certain type of streptococcus, or strep. In these cases, the illness may be called strep throat.","Contact your doctor if you or your child has symptoms of tonsillitis. Your doctor will ask about symptoms. They will also check your ears, nose, and throat for swelling and signs of infection.

Your doctor will use a swab to take a sample from the back of your throat. The sample may be used for a rapid strep test or a throat culture. Both tests can show if your infection is caused by strep or another kind of bacteria. A rapid strep test only takes a few minutes to show results. However, a throat culture must be sent to a lab and takes 24 hours or more. It is more reliable than a rapid stress test, which can give a false negative result. The doctor may order both tests to ensure a diagnosis.

In some cases, your doctor may do a blood test to determine the cause. For example, a blood test can check for mono.","Tonsillitis is not contagious, but the infections that cause it are contagious. It is spread through contact with other people, but you can prevent getting and giving it by:

• Washing your hands often
• Not sharing food and drink with others
• Avoiding close contact with people who are sick","Treatment for tonsillitis varies based on the cause. For a bacterial infection, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. Be sure to follow your doctor’s orders and take all the medicine on time. If you don’t, your infection may come back. Antibiotics also help reduce your risk of infecting others. You won’t be contagious after about 24 hours of treatment. However, if tonsillitis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won’t help.

There are some things you can do at home to help relieve your symptoms:

• Drink plenty of fluids. This includes warm, soothing liquids, such as soup, broth, or tea with honey and lemon.
• Eat soft foods, especially if it hurts to swallow.
• Gargle with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water).
• Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain. Keep in mind that children younger than 18 years of age should not take aspirin. Doing so can cause a serious illness called Reye’s syndrome.
• Suck on a throat lozenge or hard candy.
• Use a cool-mist humidifier to moisten the air.
• Rest your body and your voice.
• Change your toothbrush as you start to get better. A “dirty” toothbrush can re-infect you.

If your tonsils are so swollen that you have difficulty breathing, your doctor may prescribe steroids.","Surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) used to be common. Today, doctors only recommend surgery if tonsillitis is severe or recurring (chronic). A tonsillectomy is an outpatient surgery, meaning you don’t have to stay in the hospital.

If tonsillitis is left untreated, pus can collect in the back of your throat behind your tonsils, forming an abscess. If you have an abscess, your doctor will need to drain it with a needle. In some cases, you may need a tonsillectomy to remove the abscess.","• What is the cause of my tonsillitis?
• How long does it take to get test results? What do the test results mean?
• What medicines can I take and what are the side effects?
• Is there anything else I can do to relieve my symptoms?
• My child gets tonsillitis a lot. Do they need surgery to remove their tonsils?
• What are the benefits and risks of a tonsillectomy?
• If I have mono or strep throat, will I get tonsillitis?","Last Updated: September 16, 2024

430,Tourette Syndrome and Tics,https://familydoctor.org/condition/tics-and-tourette-syndrome/,"Tourette syndrome is a movement disorder that starts in childhood. It causes a person to make repeated twitches, movements, or sounds that they have little or no control over. These are called tics. Several different tics can happen at the same time, but they may not always occur together.

On TV, in movies, and in the news, Tourette syndrome is often associated with cursing, or making offensive comments. However, only a small percentage of people who have Tourette syndrome have this symptom.","The main symptom of Tourette syndrome is tics. Tics are rapid movements or sounds that are repeated over and over for no reason. A person with a tic can’t control the movement or sounds. Examples of common tics include:

• Throat clearing
• Eye blinking
• Sniffing
• Grunting
• Shoulder shrugging
• Jumping
• Kicking
• Arm jerking

Some tics are small and are not that noticeable. Others can be constant movements or sounds that can’t be controlled. Tics often get worse when a person feels stressed, tired, anxious, or excited. They can become better when a person is calm or focused on an activity. Usually, they aren’t a severe problem.

If a child has Tourette syndrome, the tics usually start when they are between 5 and 10 years old. They often start with a tic in the head or neck area. Other tics may follow. The movements and sounds may change over time. Some tics go away after a few months. Sometimes a person will have 1 or 2 tics for many years.

Children who have Tourette syndrome usually have their worst symptoms when they are between 9 and 13 years old. After that time, the tics may fade in intensity or go away completely. Less than half of the people who have Tourette syndrome as children have moderate to severe tics as adults.

It is possible for your child to have a tic but not have Tourette syndrome. Talk to your family doctor if you think your child may have a tic or Tourette syndrome.",Doctors don’t know exactly what causes tics and Tourette syndrome. They do know that Tourette syndrome seems to run in families. It is more common in boys than in girls.,"There is no lab test to diagnose Tourette syndrome. Your child’s doctor may do an examination or run tests to rule out other causes of the symptoms. To be diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, a person must:

• Have both motor (body movement) and vocal (involving the voice) tics. These don’t have to occur at the same time.
• Have tics that occur regularly or on and off for at least 1 year.
• Have begun having tics before the age of 18.",There is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid having tics or Tourette syndrome.,"There is no cure for Tourette syndrome. But there are medicines that can help. In most cases, people with mild symptoms are not treated. The side effects of the medicines may be worse than the symptoms themselves. But if their tics get in the way of their daily lives, people can be treated with medicine. The type of medicine used depends on the symptoms and if the person has any other medical problems. Behavioral therapy may also help.","Tourette syndrome can affect all parts of a person’s life. This includes their health, education, employment, and relationships. It also has an effect on their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

Many children with Tourette syndrome have other conditions, as well. These include:

• Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
• Obsessive-compulsive disorder (thoughts or behaviors that are repeated over and over)
• Depression
• Anxiety
• Other behavioral or conduct problems

Your doctor can help you find out if your child has any of these other conditions.

It is important to diagnose Tourette syndrome as early as possible. This will help make sure your child gets the right treatment and support so they can lead productive and healthy lives.","• How can I help my child fit in at school and around other kids?
• Is there a medicine that could help my child?
• Could my child also have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
• Are there other therapies that could help my child?

431,Toxic Shock Syndrome | Symptoms and Causes,https://familydoctor.org/condition/toxic-shock-syndrome/,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an uncommon but serious, life-threatening complication of certain types of infections. It is caused by either staph (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria or strep (Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. The bacteria produce toxins that can quickly lead to organ failure and even death.

Toxic shock syndrome was originally linked to the use of super-absorbent tampons. But changes in tampons and usage habits have made it less common. Today about half of toxic shock syndrome cases are caused by tampon use. Many cases are the result of bacteria getting into areas of injured skin. These include cuts and scrapes, surgical wounds, or chickenpox blisters. Toxic shock syndrome affects men, women, and children.","You are at higher risk for developing toxic shock syndrome if you have:

• Recently given birth
• A staph infection
• Been on your menstrual period
• Had recent surgery
• A wound infection
• Foreign bodies or packings (such as those used to stop nosebleeds) inside the body

A sudden fever of 102°F or higher is a warning sign for anyone who is at risk for toxic shock syndrome. Other symptoms might include:

• Headache
• Vomiting
• Low blood pressure
• Confusion
• Diarrhea
• Muscle aches
• Red rash on the palms of your hands or bottom of your feet

If you or your child has symptoms of toxic shock syndrome, go to the emergency room right away. The infection can get worse quickly. It can cause organs such as the liver or kidneys to fail. It can also cause seizures, bleeding, and heart failure. If left untreated, it can lead to death.

Toxic shock syndrome can lead to death in up to 50% of cases. There may be significant challenges if you survive the initial infection. This may include recovering from organ failure or from being on life support.","Most cases of toxic shock syndrome are caused by a toxin that is produced by staph bacteria. Some cases are caused by a toxin from strep bacteria. Not all staph or strep infections lead to toxic shock syndrome.

Toxic shock syndrome gained national attention in the late 1970s. It was tied to tampon use during a woman’s menstrual period. Newer research shows using a tampon for longer than the recommended time without changing it can create the perfect environment for a staph infection. But the use of a tampon is not the only way. The same danger exists with certain birth control devices when they are used longer than the recommended time. These could include a diaphragm, sponge, or cervical cap.

With tampon use, many researchers believe that inserting a tampon can scratch the vagina. This makes it vulnerable to an infection. They also think tampons made with artificial fibers are more likely to trap bacteria than tampons made with 100% cotton.

Toxic shock syndrome can also occur for other reasons. It can occur when a wound from a burn or surgery doesn’t heal properly. It can also happen from a skin infection, just after childbirth, and even in the case of a serious nosebleed that requires the use of packed medical gauze to stop it.","There is no rapid test for toxic shock syndrome. Doctors can test for staph bacteria using a blood sample or a sample taken from an infected wound. However, relying on that alone takes too long when your body is in distress. Doctors usually diagnose toxic shock syndrome based on symptoms such as a high fever, low blood pressure, and a rash.

Toxic shock syndrome can affect multiple organs. Your doctor may order other tests to see how far the illness has spread. These could include a CT scan, chest X-ray, or lumbar puncture.","The best way to avoid toxic shock syndrome is to prevent infections. Good hand-washing is always a good defense. If you have an open wound or burn, be sure it is properly cleaned. Watch for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus. Ask your doctor how you should take care of the wound or burn to avoid getting a staph infection.

You can reduce your risk of toxic shock syndrome by using tampons carefully. Doctors suggest that you should do the following during your period:

• Alternate between tampons and pads so you don’t create an environment for the bacteria to grow.
• Avoid using high-absorbency tampons.
• Change your tampon frequently, as recommended on the package (usually every 4 to 8 hours).
• On the lighter days of your period, use pads instead of tampons.
• Wash your hands before and after inserting a tampon.

You can get toxic shock syndrome more than once. If you’ve had it before or you’ve had a serious staph or strep infection, don’t use tampons.","Toxic shock syndrome is a medical emergency. Call your doctor right away if you are having symptoms. You’ll probably need to go to the hospital. Once there, the medical staff may start an IV to give you fluids, antibiotics, and blood pressure medicine. If your kidneys are failing, you also may be given blood plasma and kidney dialysis. If you are a woman who has a tampon, diaphragm, sponge, or cervical cap in place, it will be removed. If your infection is due to an infected wound, the wound will be cleaned thoroughly. Once you are stable, you may be moved to the intensive care unit for monitoring.",null,"• Could there be something other than toxic shock syndrome causing my symptoms?

432,"Toxic Synovitis, or Transient Synovitis of the Hip",https://familydoctor.org/condition/transient-synovitis-of-the-hip/,"Transient synovitis of the hip, also called toxic synovitis, is an inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the hip joint. Usually only one hip is affected. This condition is called “transient” because it lasts only a short time. Transient synovitis of the hip is the most common cause of sudden hip pain in children.

Transient synovitis of the hip usually occurs in children between 3 and 10 years of age. Sometimes it occurs in children younger than 3 years of age. It is more common in boys than in girls.","The main symptom is pain in the hip. In some children, the hip pain gets worse very quickly. In other children, the hip pain gets worse slowly. At first, the hip pain may be so mild that they don’t know there is something wrong.

When the pain gets bad enough, children who have toxic synovitis have a hard time walking. If your child has transient synovitis of the hip, he or she may have pain whenever the hip is moved. Your child may walk with a limp. Because of the pain, your child may have trouble standing. Some children may have pain of the inner thigh or knee area, instead of around the hip. Many children who have this condition want to lie on their back with the knee on the side that hurts bent and turned out with their foot pointed away from their body. This position may lessen the pain.",Doctors don’t know the exact cause of transient synovitis of the hip. It might be caused by a virus or it might be from an allergic reaction to an infection somewhere else in the body.,"Your doctor will look at your child’s hip to find out what kind of movement makes the pain worse. Your doctor may order blood tests, X-rays, and an ultrasound. These tests will help your doctor make sure that the cause of hip pain isn’t caused by something more serious.","Since doctors don’t know what causes transient synovitis of the hip, it can’t be prevented or avoided.","Rest at home is the most important way to help your child’s hip get better. Your child may need to take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, such as ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin), to reduce the swelling and inflammation around the hip joint. Also, your doctor may advise you to apply heat to your child’s hip. Massage may make the area to make it feel better, too.

Your child’s doctor will probably ask you to take your child’s temperature regularly and to report any temperature higher than 99.5°F. A fever may mean that your child has a problem other than hip synovitis. To make sure that your child is doing well, your doctor may want to recheck your child 12 to 24 hours after the first visit.

With rest and medicine, your child’s hip will probably get better in 3 or 4 days. After the pain leaves, your child can resume his or her usual activities. In most children, there are no complications from transient synovitis of the hip. They recover completely. To make sure everything is all right, your doctor may want to take another X-ray of your child’s hip in about 6 months.","If the pain is still bad after 10 days, your child should be rechecked by your doctor. Your doctor may order some tests to make sure there isn’t something else wrong with your child’s hip.","• What is the likely cause of my child’s hip pain?
• What is the best treatment option?
• Do I need to take my child’s temperature on a regular basis? What should I do if he/she develops a fever?
• How long before my child can expect relief from his/her pain?
• Is there anything I can do at home to help relieve my child’s pain?

433,Toxoplasmosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/toxoplasmosis/,Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. It can live in a cat’s intestines and be spread through its feces. It also can live in dirt and on some food we eat.,"Most people do not show signs of toxoplasmosis. This is because their immune systems attack the parasite and prevent illness. You may have flu-like symptoms, such as:

• Fatigue
• Headache
• Body aches
• Fever
• Swollen lymph nodes (glands in your neck)

People who have a weak immune system may have worse symptoms. These can include:

• Confusion
• Blurry vision
• Trouble with balance and coordination
• Seizures
• Lung problems

You may have a weak immune system if you:

• Have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
• Have cancer
• Have had an organ transplant
• Are receiving chemotherapy agents or other medicines that suppress your immune system","People get toxoplasmosis when they come into contact with the parasite. This can happen in several ways.

You can get it through food if you:

• Eat raw or undercooked meat, especially pork, lamb, or wild game
• Touch something, such as a cutting board or dish, that has been in contact with raw or undercooked meat and then touch your mouth, eyes, or face
• Eat unwashed raw fruits and vegetables
• Drink water with the parasite in it

Cats can carry the parasite, especially if they hunt animals or eat raw meat. You can expose yourself to the parasite through your cat’s feces, either in its litter or in dirt that has cat droppings in it. You also can get it from touching anything that has been in contact with cat droppings.

People who have an organ transplant or a blood transfusion can get toxoplasmosis if the organ or blood is infected. This is very rare.","Routine screening for toxoplasmosis is not recommended. Contact you doctor if you have symptoms or are at risk. They will do a blood test to check for the parasite. If the test is positive, your doctor will check to see if the infection is active or not.

Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or if you have a weak immune system. These people are at an increased risk.","There are many things you can do to protect yourself and prevent toxoplasmosis.

• Wear gloves when you work outside. Cover children’s sandboxes when not in use. Cats often use gardens and sandboxes as litter boxes.
• Wash your hands after being outside, especially before you eat or prepare food.
• Wash your hands after touching cats, soil, or raw meat.
• Wash or peel all fruits and vegetables before eating them.
• Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or face when preparing food.
• Use hot soapy water to clean items that have been in contact with raw meat.
• Clean the counter after preparing food.
• Cook meat and poultry until it is no longer pink in the center or until the juices run clear.
• Avoid eating undercooked meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables.
• Avoid drinking untreated water. This is more common in underdeveloped countries.
• Avoid drinking unpasteurized (raw) goat’s milk or eating raw eggs.
• Control flies and cockroaches as much as possible. They can spread contaminated soil or cat feces onto food.

If you are at risk, you should take extra precautions.

• Keep your cat indoors so that it does not pick up the parasite.
• Feed your cat only dry or canned cat food. Like humans, cats can become infected by eating raw or undercooked meat.
• Avoid touching outdoor or stray cats.
• Have someone else take care of your cat or change your cat’s litter box while you are pregnant. If you have to change the cat litter yourself, wear gloves while you do it. When you finish, wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Clean the litter box daily. Disinfect it with boiling water for 5 minutes.","Healthy people who are not at risk do not need treatment for toxoplasmosis. Any symptoms you may have should go away within a few weeks or months. If you are pregnant or have a weak immune system, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics.","Women who get toxoplasmosis while pregnant are at risk of passing it to their unborn babies. In most cases, infected babies are born healthy but may have future health issues. These include damage to the eyes and brain.

Women who were infected at least 6 to 9 months before pregnancy should have immunity. This means the infection will not be active during pregnancy, and the risk of passing it to your baby is low.

There is no benefit to testing your cat’s droppings for toxoplasmosis. Once cats are infected, they only spread the parasite in their droppings for the first few weeks.","• Should I be screened for toxoplasmosis?
• Is it safe for me to keep and pet my cat while pregnant?
• Do I need treatment for toxoplasmosis?
• What medicines should I take and what are the side effects?
• How do I know if my unborn baby has toxoplasmosis?
• What are the possible health issues my unborn baby could have?
• Once I have toxoplasmosis, will I always have it?
• Am I at risk of having other health issues?
• My cat doesn’t go outside. Could it still get toxoplasmosis?
• Is it safe for me to eat rare meat?
• How hot should the water be when I clean my cutting board?
• Is there a specific kind of cutting board that is safer to use?
• Are automatic litter boxes safer than regular litter boxes?","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Toxoplasmosis

434,Transient Ischemic Attack,https://familydoctor.org/condition/transient-ischemic-attack-tia/,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a stroke. It is considered a warning stroke. During this type of stroke, blood flow to your brain is blocked for a few minutes to a few hours. The average amount of time is one minute. Most symptoms go away within 24 hours. That is far less than a major stroke. There is usually no long-term damage following a TIA. This type of stroke significantly increases your risk of a major stroke.","TIA symptoms are similar to a major stroke. They include:

• Weakness/loss of feeling in your face, arm, or leg
• Trouble seeing in one or both eyes
• Difficulty smiling or speaking
• Confusion
• Sudden, severe headache
• Difficulty walking or balancing","All strokes are caused by reduction or loss of blood flow. The most common cause is a blood clot. This is same for a major stroke. Blood clots are caused by cholesterol buildup. As cholesterol blocks your arteries, it forms a blood clot. Eventually, the clot breaks free. The clot travels to your brain. That’s where the TIA occurs. Managing your cholesterol levels through diet, exercise, and medicine lowers your risk.

Other medical conditions can increase your chances of having a stroke. These include high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of stroke. This includes not smoking and limiting alcohol. Other risks include age, heredity, gender, and ethnicity. If you’ve had one stroke, you are at a higher risk of having another one.","It’s difficult to identify a TIA from a major stroke as it’s happening. Self-awareness is important. Getting to a hospital or calling 911 also is important. That’s because treating a TIA or major stroke fast prevents further damage. A doctor will perform a physical exam. They will ask you about your medical history. This includes questions about other medical conditions and your lifestyle. The doctor will listen to your heart and lungs and test you for signs of numbness, weakness, or other neurologic problems.

A TIA may only last minutes but could last longer. You, a family member or friend should remember your symptoms and what time they began. All tests and exams will happen after you have the TIA.

Certain imaging tests can diagnose a stroke. They include:

• Carotid ultrasonography. This uses sound waves to examine the blood flow through your carotid arteries. These are the arteries in your neck that supply blood to your brain.
• CT (computerized tomography). A large x-ray machine will be used to take detailed internal pictures of your body.
• CTA (computerized tomography angiography). This combines a CT scan with an injection of a special dye that will help create pictures of blood vessels and tissues in your body.
• MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to form pictures of the inside of your body.
• MRA (magnetic resonance angiography). Similar to an MRI, this test specifically looks at your blood vessels.
• TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram). In this test, ultrasound is used to create images of your heart.
• TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram). In this test, the ultrasound probe is inserted into your esophagus to take pictures of your heart. Since your esophagus and heart are next to each other in your chest, this shows details of the heart that may not be seen on a transthoracic echocardiogram

Sometimes an arteriography (a test that creates a picture of your arteries using dye and X-rays) is used to diagnose a TIA or minor stroke.","After a TIA, your doctor may want you to take aspirin. Aspirin can help keep your blood from forming clots that block your arteries. If taking low-dose aspirin is right for you, it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions. Your doctor may also prescribe a statin. Statin drugs help to lower your cholesterol levels and avoid cholesterol buildup in your arteries.

You also can reduce risk through healthy living and managing diseases that cause strokes. Maintain a healthy diet, exercise, don’t smoke, limit alcohol, and take your medicines. This is good advice whether you are at risk or not. See your doctor if you have a medical history, family history, or other risk factors. A TIA is a warning for a future, major stroke. Without lifestyle changes and medicine, a second TIA or major stroke can happen within a year of your first TIA. Even with healthy changes, there’s no guarantee you won’t have a stroke.","Most of the time, your body treats a TIA on its own. The blood clot quickly dissolves. A TIA still requires immediate attention. Go to an emergency room when you recognize symptoms. Time is critical in treating all strokes. The sooner you are treated, the better your recovery and outcome.

• Antiplatelet medicine. Antiplatelet medicines help prevent blood clots. They don’t allow certain cells in the blood (called platelets) to clump together. This reduces the risk of blockages in the arteries that can lead to heart attack and stroke. They are sometimes prescribed along with aspirin therapy.
• Anticoagulants (blood thinners). Blood thinners don’t actually thin the blood. They decrease the ability of the blood to clot. This helps prevent clots from forming in the blood vessels. It also may prevent clots from becoming larger. Large clots can cause more serious problems.
• Surgery. Surgery would open a clogged artery. You may need medicine and surgery. Endarterectomy surgery is necessary for people with a narrow neck artery. This surgery cleans blockages from that artery.","TIA’s do not cause long-term damage (walking, talking). Anxiety and worry about another stroke is common. This is true even after making lifestyle changes and taking medicine. Teach yourself, your family, and friends to recognize the signs of a stroke. The phrase FAST helps you remember the symptoms.

F — Face. You can’t smile. Your face or mouth is drooping. This is limited to one side of your face.

A — Arms. You can’t raise one or both arms.

S — Speech. You can’t speak, repeat a simple phrase. Your speech is slurred.

T — Time. Time is the most important factor in treating a stroke. Receiving treatment within 3 hours of your symptoms provides the best outcome and recovery. The sooner, the better.

Teach your family and friends the FAST rule in case you cannot communicate.","• How much does family history increase your risk of stroke?
• Can medicines cause stroke?
• Can caffeine cause a stroke?
• Are there other conditions that could cause these symptoms?
• What should I do if I am more than 4.5 hours from a hospital for treatment?
• What are the complications of an untreated stroke?
• Can I die from a TIA?","American Stroke Association: Transient Ischemic Attack

435,Traumatic Brain Injury,https://familydoctor.org/condition/traumatic-brain-injury/,"A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is any sudden injury to your brain. It happens when a bump, blow, jolt, or other injury damages the brain. It can occur from a strong or violent strike to your head.

TBIs can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much damage there is. Concussions are a mild form of TBI. Mild forms cause temporary symptoms that usually go away a few days or weeks after the injury. The most severe TBIs can cause permanent brain damage, coma, or death.","Some symptoms of a traumatic brain injury happen immediately after the traumatic event. Others may not appear for several days or weeks.

For a mild injury, it’s normal to feel dizzy, nauseated, or have a headache. Other mild symptoms include:

• Ringing in your ears
• Neck pain
• Blurry vision
• Confusion
• Slow reflexes
• Brief loss of consciousness

These mild symptoms usually go away after a few days or weeks.

In addition to these symptoms, moderate or severe TBIs may include:

• Lasting nausea or vomiting
• Lasting headache
• Dilated (larger than normal) pupils
• Trouble waking up, walking, or speaking
• Slurred speech
• Weakness or numbness in your arms or legs
• Drainage of bloody or clear fluids from your ears or nose
• Seizures

These types of TBIs are serious and can have lasting effects. Your mood can change, making you feel angry, anxious, or sensitive. Short-term memory can be affected, as well as your ability to think and focus. You may have trouble controlling your impulses.

Always seek medical care if you have hit your head. If your symptoms are severe, call 911 or go to the emergency room. Contact a doctor if someone you know has a head injury and acts strange.","There are many things that can cause a traumatic brain injury. Many TBIs occur in motor vehicle accidents. Others can happen as a result of:

• Falls
• Assaults
• Sports or recreation injuries (especially high-contact sports like football, boxing, and mixed martial arts)
• Gunshot wounds
• Child abuse, including shaken baby syndrome
• Military actions (blast injuries)

There are different types of injuries that can happen to the brain.

• A concussion occurs from a hard fall or hit to the head. It jars your brain and causes shock or trauma. Most of the time you don’t lose consciousness. You may feel dazed and off-balance. You also may have brief decreased vision or memory.
• A brain contusion is a bruise of the brain. It causes bleeding in your brain and swelling. This type of bruise is on your brain and not visible on your skin.
• A skull fracture is when the skull cracks. If this happens, broken bones can cut into your brain and cause bleeding or other damage.
• An intracranial hematoma is bleeding inside the skull that collects and clots. A mass of clotted blood forms between your brain and skull. It may not show up for a few days, or even weeks, after an injury.","Your doctor will perform a neurological exam. He or she will ask you questions about the injury and symptoms. They also will test your physical and mental reflexes. The exam helps your doctor determine how severe your brain injury is. You may need other tests, such as an X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests take pictures of your head and brain. They show if there is a skull fracture or bleeding, bruising, or blood clots in your brain.","There are some things you can do to lower the risk for a TBI. You should:

• Always wear a seatbelt in the car.
• Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
• Wear a helmet in sports and activities, like biking, skating, horse riding, skiing, and snowboarding.
• Avoid dangerous sports and activities.
• Use child car seats correctly. Always buckle your young child into a car seat before you drive.
• Make living areas safe for children. Install window guards to keep children from falling out of windows. Use safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs.
• Make sure the surface of playgrounds where your kids play is made of shock-absorbing material, such as mulch or sand.
• Make living areas safe for seniors. Remove tripping hazards, use nonslip mats in showers and bathtubs, and install handrails and grab bars on stairs or in the bathroom.","Traumatic brain injury is an emergency situation. Treatment depends on the type, location, and severity of the injury.

If you have a mild injury, treatment will consist mainly of rest. You can also take over-the-counter pain medicine can help relieve headaches or neck pain. You should be watched closely at home for any new or worsening symptoms. You may go back to see the doctor for a check-up.

If you have a moderate or severe injury, your doctor will start by stabilizing your injury. This involves getting oxygen to your brain and body, maintaining blood flow, and managing blood pressure. These precautions help prevent further damage. You may receive medicines in the hospital or you could need surgery. A surgeon can repair a skull fracture, stop bleeding in the brain, remove blood clots, or relieve pressure inside the skull. Surgery may be needed immediately. Sometimes blood clots take time to form, and surgery is needed days or weeks after the injury.

Many people with moderate to severe TBI need rehabilitation. The type of rehab you need will depend on many factors, including how severe the injury was and what part of the brain it affected. For example, if the injury affected the part of your brain involved with speech, you may need speech therapy. Or, if it affected the area of the brain that controls movement, you may need physical therapy. Your rehab may take place in the hospital, in a skilled nursing facility, in an outpatient clinic, or at home. It usually involves many specialists. The goal of any therapy or rehabilitation is to improve your ability to perform daily activities.","Some traumatic brain injuries have lasting effects. You may be left with disabilities. These can be physical, behavioral, communicative, and/or mental. Customized treatment helps you to have as full and normal a life as possible.

If you have lasting effects from your injury, you might find it helpful to find a support group. There, others who have experienced similar injuries can help you learn about issues related to your injury, teach you coping strategies, and offer emotional support. Ask your doctor or rehabilitation therapist if there are any support groups near you.","• Could I have a traumatic brain injury and not know it?
• Will my symptoms show up weeks later?
• For a mild traumatic brain injury, how long before I can return to my daily routine?
• Does a traumatic brain injury cause permanent brain damage?
• Can you recommend a support group for people who have traumatic brain injuries?","Brain Injury Association of America: About Brain Injury

437,Trigeminal Neuralgia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/trigeminal-neuralgia/,"Trigeminal neuralgia is a painful condition that causes an extreme burning, electric or shock-like pain in the face. The pain can be so extreme that it can get in the way of normal activity. Even the fear of oncoming attacks can be so stressful that performing day-to-day tasks is a challenge.","The pain from trigeminal neuralgia may last a few seconds or minutes, then ease and then recur. Usually, these cycles of pain occur for a few days or weeks, and then stop for days, weeks or even years before returning. Over time, the cycles tend to recur more quickly, with shorter breaks in between.

The pain sometimes is triggered by very normal activities, such as chewing, smiling, talking, shaving or brushing your teeth. At times, even the wind on your face can cause pain to start. Some people who have trigeminal neuralgia notice numbness or tingling of the face in the days leading up to an attack.","Trigeminal neuralgia occurs when the trigeminal nerve is pinched or damaged. The trigeminal nerve connects many different parts of your face to your brain. It is made up of three branches. The upper branch links the brain to the scalp and forehead. The middle branch connects to the cheek, side of the nose, top lip, and upper jaw, teeth, and gums. The lower branch extends to the lower jaw, teeth, gums, and bottom lip.

The damaged area of the nerve is often located at the base of the brain. This is where the nerve extends to parts of the face. A blood vessel that grows too close and presses on the nerve may cause damage. It could also wear away the nerve’s protective coating (called myelin). Something like a tumor can also cause damage by putting extra pressure on the nerve. In many cases, a cause of the nerve damage cannot be found.","No one specific test can confirm you have trigeminal neuralgia. Often, the diagnosis is made by ruling out other possible causes of your pain. Your doctor may try to pinpoint the cause by asking you questions about your symptoms and medical history. They may check for other things that could be causing your pain, such as jaw, sinus, or tooth problems. Your doctor may order a type of brain scan called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see if a blood vessel is pressing against your trigeminal nerve. An MRI can also look for signs of a tumor or other problems.","Anyone can get trigeminal neuralgia, so you can’t really prevent it. It’s more likely for people older than 50 years of age. It’s also more common in people who have multiple sclerosis. This is because multiple sclerosis damages the myelin that protects the nerves. Women are more likely to get it than men. The condition seems to be passed down in families, probably because relatives’ blood vessels form in similar ways.","Trigeminal neuralgia can be treated in many ways. Some treatments will work well for some people and less so for others. Don’t get discouraged if the first treatment you try doesn’t work. Let your doctor know how you are doing and ask about other options

Your doctor may prescribe an antiseizure drug. These medicines change how nerves send information. That is why they can help with the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia. Examples include carbamazepine, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, topiramate and valproic acid.

Certain types of antidepressants can also help with the pain. These alter the chemical action in your brain that leads to sensing pain. Some examples include amitriptyline, bupropion, doxepin, duloxetine, imipramine, paroxetine, nortriptyline, and venlafaxine.

Combinations of two or even three medications may be more effective than a single medication. You may need to try different medications and combinations to find the most effective treatment. Side effects, such as feeling tired, can limit the use of some medications.

Your doctor might suggest you try a nerve block. This is an injection with an anesthetic. It can stop the nerve from hurting, at least for a little while.

If medicines do not help enough and the pain is affecting your ability to function, you may need surgery. During surgery, your doctor will damage or destroy certain nerves using chemicals, electric currents, radiation, or other means. The trigeminal nerve itself might be cut to eliminate or reduce the pain. Any surgery in which nerves are destroyed will cause some ongoing numbness. However, pain can sometimes return after surgery and be worse than before.","Not knowing when you’ll have flareups of facial pain is stressful. That’s why it is important to work with your doctor to find a treatment plan that will work for you. Also, become as knowledgeable about your condition as possible. That way, you can play a more active role in your care. Find a support group of other people who have trigeminal neuralgia. Having a safe space to vent and share stories can go a long way in boosting your mental and emotional health. It also reminds you that you aren’t alone.","• I have multiple sclerosis. Am I at risk of trigeminal neuralgia?
• I’ve had trigeminal neuralgia. How can I prevent it from happening again?
• How long will this condition last? Will it go away permanently?
• Will I need surgery to treat trigeminal neuralgia?
• Will lifestyle changes help treat or prevent trigeminal neuralgia?","American Chronic Pain Association

438,Tuberculosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/tuberculosis/,"Tuberculosis, also called TB, is an infection caused by bacteria. Tuberculosis usually affects the lungs. But it can also affect other parts of the body. This could include the joints, kidneys, spine, and brain.

• Latent or Inactive TB:The bacteria are present in your body but aren’t making you sick or contagious. Your immune system is protecting your body from the bacteria. You aren’t able to spread the disease.
• Active TB:The bacteria are present and are causing symptoms. Your immune system wasn’t able to fight them. You may be able to spread the disease.

If it isn’t treated properly, TB can be fatal.","Your symptoms will depend on what area of your body is affected. Usually TB affects the lungs. The symptoms of active TB in the lungs include:

• Bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer
• Coughing up blood or sputum (mucus from deep inside the lungs)
• Chest pain
• Fever
• Fatigue
• Loss of appetite
• Unintended weight loss
• Chills
• Night sweats

If TB affects your joints, you may develop pain that feels like arthritis. If TB affects your bladder, it may hurt to go to the bathroom and there may be blood in your urine. TB of the spine can cause back pain and leg paralysis. TB of the brain can cause headaches and nausea.

Healthy people are often able to fight off the infection. They usually don’t develop active TB but the bacteria are dormant (inactive) in their lungs. If your body isn’t able to contain the infection and the bacteria continue to grow, active TB can develop. This can happen years after you’re infected. It usually happens when something causes your immune system to weaken. Most of the time, you’ll have symptoms if you have active TB. But sometimes people have active TB and don’t know it.","TB is caused by bacteria. The bacteria spread through the air from one person to another. The bacteria enter the air when a person with active TB in the throat or lungs talks, laughs, sneezes, or coughs. Anyone who is nearby can then breathe in that air and breathe in the bacteria. Then they become infected.

TB bacteria is spread only through the air. You can’t get TB by:

• Shaking someone’s hand
• Sharing food or drink
• Sharing toothbrushes
• Touching something an infected person has touched

Once you breathe in the bacteria, they settle in your lungs and begin to grow. Sometimes the bacteria move from the lungs to other areas of the body. This could include the kidneys, spine, and brain.

When you have an active infection in your lungs or throat, you’re contagious. This means you can spread the disease to other people. When the disease is in other parts of your body, and not your lungs or throat, you’re usually not able to spread it.

It’s not easy to get tuberculosis. Usually, you have to be in close contact with someone who has active TB. You need to be around them for an extended period of time. TB tends to be spread between family members, close friends, and people who live or work together.

If you do get infected, you’re at higher risk of developing active TB disease if you have a weakened immune system. This could include:

• Babies and young children
• People with chronic conditions such as diabetes
• People with HIV/AIDS
• Recipients of organ transplants
• Cancer patients going through chemotherapy","The most commonly used method to check for tuberculosis is a skin test. Blood tests can also be used. If you have a positive skin test or blood test, it means you have been exposed to a person who has tuberculosis. You have been infected with the bacteria that cause the disease. The test doesn’t tell you if you have a latent TB infection or if you have active TB disease.

If your skin test is positive, you will likely have a chest X-ray and a physical exam. This will tell your doctor which kind of TB you have. Usually, a person can be infected with the bacteria that cause TB but not actually have active tuberculosis. Of the people who are infected with the bacteria, only a few (about 10%) go on to develop active TB.","The best way to prevent getting a tuberculosis infection is to avoid being in close contact with a person who has active TB disease.

There is a vaccine against tuberculosis. It’s used in countries where TB is common. It’s not often used in the United States because the chances of being infected with TB are low.","Tuberculosis is treated with antibiotic medicine. The medicine(s) your doctor recommends will depend on many factors. These include your age, your health, whether your TB is active or latent, and whether your TB is drug resistant. This means that certain medicines won’t work on it.

You will need to take your TB medicine(s) for 6-9 months. Your doctor will tell you exactly how and when to take your medicine, and for how long. It is very important that you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. Take your medicine at the same time every day. Don’t skip doses or stop taking your medicine. This could make your TB harder to treat.

If you’re infected with TB but don’t have active TB, you can take medicine to prevent the disease from developing. This is called preventive therapy. If you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully, you won’t develop TB disease.

Common medicines used to treat tuberculosis include:

• Isoniazid
• Rifampin
• Ethambutol
• Pyrazinamide

Depending on your doctor’s recommendations, you may take 1 or more of these medicines. These medicines don’t usually cause side effects. However, TB drugs can damage your liver.

Don’t drink alcohol or take acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) while taking TB medicines. Alcohol and acetaminophen can increase the risk of liver problems. Always check with your doctor before you take any other medicine. Some medicines interact with TB medicines and can cause side effects.

While taking these medicines, your doctor may want to monitor you every month. For example, you may need to visit your doctor for tests, to get another prescription, and to check for any side effects or problems.

Although side effects from tuberculosis medicine aren’t common, they can be serious. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms:

• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Abdominal pain, tenderness or soreness
• Blurry vision or color-blindness
• Dark (coffee-colored) urine
• Fever that lasts 3 days or longer
• Jaundice (the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes)","If you have active TB disease, it will take several weeks of treatment before you are no longer contagious. Until then, it’s important to take steps so you don’t spread the bacteria.

• Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking your medicine.
• Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue any time you cough, sneeze, or laugh. Put the tissue in a closed bag before you throw it away.
• Avoid close contact with other people.
• Sleep in a bedroom by yourself. Air out the room often so the bacteria don’t stay in the room.
• Stay home from work or school until your doctor says it’s okay to return.

If you develop active TB disease, you may need to be monitored medically for the rest of your life. This could include regular checkups and probably chest X-rays. This is done to make sure you stay free of TB disease, even after you have taken the full course of TB medicine.","• How common is tuberculosis in the United States?

439,Tuberous Sclerosis,https://familydoctor.org/condition/tuberous-sclerosis/,"Tuberous sclerosis is a rare disease that causes tumors, or growths, in the brain and other organs. These growths can occur in the skin, kidneys, eyes, heart, or lungs. They are usually benign (not cancerous). However, when severe, tuberous sclerosis can shorten your life.

The first signs of tuberous sclerosis may occur at birth. Other people develop symptoms over time. Some of the first signs are seizures that are hard to control and spots on the skin. Some people may have learning problems.

Tuberous sclerosis affects every 1 in 6,000 newborns in the United States. The disorder occurs in both boys and girls and in people of all races and ethnic groups.","Your doctor may suspect tuberous sclerosis if your baby has a condition called cardiac rhabdomyomas (benign heart tumors) at birth. Another sign in infants is having seizures, especially a kind called infantile spasms.

Other symptoms can appear later in childhood or even in adulthood. They include:

• White spots on your skin that glow under a special lamp
• A rash on your face that may look like acne
• Problems with your kidneys
• Areas of very thick skin, often on your back
• Growths under or around your nails
• Pitted teeth
• Mental disabilities
• Developmental delays
• Autism spectrum disorder

The symptoms of tuberous sclerosis are different for different people. Some people may have mild symptoms. Others may have intellectual disabilities and seizures that are hard to control.","Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition. That means it is caused a change in your genes, the elements that make your body. Sometimes, it can be passed down through a family. If one parent has it, every child born to that parent has up to a 50% chance of inheriting it, too. But in most cases of the disease, there is no family history.","Your doctor will talk with you about your symptoms and health history. They may order several tests. They may do a CT scan or MRI of your head. They may do a CT scan of your chest or an echocardiogram of your heart. They may also do an ultrasound of the kidneys. Sometimes your doctor might perform an ultraviolet light examination of your skin. This helps identify if you have white spots on your skin that can come with tuberous sclerosis.

It is possible to diagnose the disease in an infant, especially one with a benign heart tumor or seizures. But many times, children aren’t diagnosed until they are older and other symptoms start to appear.","There is no way to prevent or avoid tuberous sclerosis. If you have a family history of the disease and you want to have children, talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a genetic counselor or medical geneticist.","There is no cure for tuberous sclerosis. However, your doctor can treat many of the symptoms:

• Seizures: Medicine may control these. Some children may need surgery on their brain to help with seizures.
• Small growths on the face: These can be removed with laser treatment, though they do tend to come back.
• Brain tumors: These can be treated with medicine.
• Kidney tumors: Surgery is often needed for these.
• Developmental problems: Your doctor may refer your child to an occupational therapist.
• Intellectual disability: Your doctor may recommend special education for your child.","Tuberous sclerosis is a lifelong condition, though many people who have it live a normal life. Their symptoms are mild or can be treated by their doctor. If symptoms are more severe, the disease can have more of an impact on your life. For example, children who have uncontrollable seizures or a severe mental disability may need assistance for the rest of their lives.

Anyone who has tuberous sclerosis is at higher risk of developing complications related to brain tumors or kidney lesions. That is why it is important to see your doctor regularly. They can help monitor your symptoms and catch complications early.

Some communities offer support systems for tuberous sclerosis. If you’d like to connect with other families experiencing the same thing, ask your doctor if there’s a group in your area.","• My child is having seizures. Do they have tuberous sclerosis?
• Can my child’s tuberous sclerosis be treated with surgery?
• Are there any medicines that can make my child better?
• Will my child have intellectual disabilities?
• I have one child who has tuberous sclerosis. If I have another baby, will they have tuberous sclerosis, too?
• Is there a tuberous sclerosis support group in my area?","National Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Tuberous Sclerosis

440,Type 1 Diabetes,https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetes-type1/,"Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your body doesn’t make or use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone. It causes too much blood glucose (sugar) to build up in the blood. There are two main types of diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes, the focus of this article, occurs when your body doesn’t produce any insulin. It is an autoimmune disease that develops gradually over time. If often has no initial symptoms. It’s sometimes called juvenile diabetes because it’s usually discovered in children and teenagers, but it may appear in adults, too.

Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough insulin or doesn’t use the insulin as it should. In the past, doctors thought only adults were at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, an increasing number of children in the United States are now being diagnosed with the disease. Doctors think this increase is mostly because more children are overweight or have obesity and are less physically active.","Symptoms vary from person to person. The early stages of diabetes have very few symptoms. You may not know you have the disease. But damage may already be happening to your eyes, your kidneys, and your cardiovascular system. Common symptoms include:

• Extreme hunger
• Extreme thirst
• Frequent urination
• Unexplained weight loss
• Fatigue or drowsiness
• Blurry vision
• Slow-healing wounds, sores, or bruises
• Dry, itchy skin
• Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet
• Frequent or recurring skin, gum, bladder, or vaginal yeast infections

If blood sugars are extremely high, people can develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This is a very dangerous complication of uncontrolled diabetes. People with DKA might have:

• Nausea or vomiting more than once
• Deeper, faster breathing
• The smell of nail polish remover coming from your breath
• Weakness, drowsiness, trembling, confusion, or dizziness
• Uncoordinated muscle movement

If diabetes is left untreated, your blood sugar levels become too high. When this happens, symptoms may include shortness of breath, pain in the abdomen, vomiting, dehydration, and even coma and death.","In type 1 diabetes, your body doesn’t make insulin. This is because the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin. Doctors aren’t sure why this happens. You have a greater risk of type 1 diabetes if one of your parents or one of your siblings has it. According to the American Diabetes Association, if you have a close family member who has type 1 diabetes, you are 15 times more likely to develop the disease yourself.","If you have a family member who has type 1 diabetes, your doctor may want to screen you early because you are at greater risk for developing diabetes.

After examining you, discussing your symptoms, and going over your health history, your doctor may test for diabetes if they suspect you’re at risk. To check for diabetes, your doctor may request the following tests:

• Fasting blood sugar test. This test is usually done in the morning, after an 8-hour fast (not eating or drinking anything except water for 8 hours before the test). The blood test typically involves a finger stick to get a drop of blood. But it could also be done by inserting a small needle into a vein in your arm to withdraw blood. That blood will be sent to a lab for testing. If your blood sugar level is 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher, your doctor will probably want to repeat the test. A blood sugar level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher on 2 occasions indicates diabetes. A blood sugar level of 100 mg per dL to 125 mg per dL suggest you have prediabetes. A blood sugar level of less than 99 mg per dL is normal.

• Oral glucose tolerance test. During this test, you will drink a beverage containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This tastes like sweet water. Two hours later, a doctor or nurse will measure the amount of glucose in your blood. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes.

• Random blood sugar test. This test measures the level of glucose in your blood at any time of day. It doesn’t matter when you last ate. Combined with symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes.

• A1C blood test. This test provides information about a person’s average levels of blood glucose over the previous 3 months. The results are reported as a percentage. A normal A1C level is below 5.7%. If your A1C is higher than that, it means your blood sugar has been higher than normal during that three-month period. A test result between 5.7% and 6.4% indicates prediabetes. A result of 6.5% or above indicates diabetes.

It is important to tell your doctor if you have a family member who has type 1 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented or avoided, but it can be managed.","The single most important thing you can do when you have diabetes is control your blood sugar level. You can do this by through a combination of taking insulin and eating right, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight.

• Your diet should include lots of complex carbohydrates (such as whole grains), fruits, and vegetables. It’s important to eat at least 3 meals per day and never skip a meal. Eat at about the same time every day. This helps keep your insulin or medicine and sugar levels steady. Avoid empty calories, such as foods high in sugar and fat, or alcohol.

• Exercising helps your body use insulin and lower your blood sugar level. It also helps control your weight, gives you more energy, and is good for your overall health. Exercise also is good for your heart, your cholesterol levels, your blood pressure, and your weight. These are all factors that can affect your risk of heart attack and stroke. Talk with your doctor about starting an exercise program.

• Maintain a healthy weight. Losing excess weight and maintaining a healthy body weight will help you in two ways. First, it helps insulin work better in your body. Second, it will lower your blood pressure and decrease your risk for heart disease. Even a 10% reduction in weight can lower your blood sugar levels.

• Take your medicine. Insulin therapy is necessary for all people who have type 1 diabetes. You’ll have to give yourself a shot (either with a syringe or with an insulin pen). Your doctor will tell you which kind of medicine you should take and why.

Your doctor will test your blood sugar every 3 months with an A1C test. Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar on your own throughout the day if you are taking insulin. You will need to use a blood glucose monitor to check it on your own. This involves pricking your finger for blood and putting a test strip in the blood. Putting the test strip in the monitor gets the results. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are also an option to help people with diabetes measure their blood glucose around the clock

If your blood sugar gets too low, you might feel tired, experience problems with muscle coordination, sweat, have difficulty thinking or speaking clearly, twitch, feel like you’re going to faint, become pale, lose consciousness, or have a seizure. At the earliest sign of any of these symptoms, eat or drink something that will raise your blood sugar fast. This could include candy, juice, milk, or raisins. If you don’t feel better in 15 minutes or if monitoring shows that your blood sugar level is still too low, eat or drink another item to raise your blood sugar fast. Always keep a supply of these items on hand for emergencies.

You may not know if your blood sugar is too high unless you test it yourself. However, you may experience common symptoms such as frequent urination, extreme thirst, blurry vision, and feeling tired. Some factors unrelated to food can make your blood sugar high. This includes not taking your insulin correctly, overeating at a meal, illness, having hormonal changes, and stress.

If your blood sugar level is too high, you may need to take an extra dose of rapid- or short-acting insulin to return to normal. Your doctor can tell you how much insulin you need to take to lower your blood sugar level.","You can live a normal life with well-controlled diabetes. However, you must pay close and regular attention to your diet, weight, exercise, and medicine. If you don’t control your diabetes, you will have too much glucose in your blood. This can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and damage to the nerves and kidneys. You could also lose your vision and sensation in your legs. These are known as diabetic complications.

The longer your diabetes is uncontrolled, the more damage you do to your health. That’s why treatment is important at any age. Keeping blood sugar levels very close to the ideal can minimize, delay, and in some cases even prevent the problems that diabetes can cause.","• How did I get diabetes?

• If I have diabetes, will my children develop it, too?

• Will I need to take insulin?

• If I don’t have a family history of diabetes, can I still get it?

• Can your diabetes get worse even if you do everything right?","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Diabetes

441,Ulcers - Stomach Ulcer Symptoms,https://familydoctor.org/condition/ulcers/,Ulcers are sores on the lining of your stomach or small intestine. Sores also could be on your esophagus (throat). Most ulcers are located in the small intestine. These ulcers are called duodenal ulcers. Stomach ulcers are called gastric ulcers. Ulcers in the throat are called esophageal ulcers.,"• Discomfort between meals or during the night (duodenal ulcer)
• Discomfort when you eat or drink (gastric ulcer)
• Stomach pain that wakes you up at night
• Feel full fast
• Bloating, burning, or dull pain in your stomach
• Comes and goes days or weeks at a time
• The discomfort lasts for minutes or hour

If your ulcer becomes perforated (torn), it becomes a bleeding ulcer. This can cause the following symptoms:

• Nausea
• Vomiting blood
• Unexpected weight loss
• Blood in your stool or dark stools
• Pain in your back",A bacterial infection called Heliocobacter pylori (H. pylori) is typcially what causes ulcers. Acids from the foods we eat can make the pain and discomfort worse. Long-term use of aspirin or anti-inflammatory medicines (ibuprofen) are also a common cause of ulcers. Stress and spicy foods can make an ulcer worse.,"Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. They may do an endoscopy. This procedure involves inserting a thin, flexible tube attached to a camera down your throat and into your stomach. Your doctor will test your blood, breath, or stool for H. pylori. They also can test a sample of your stomach lining. Your doctor also will ask you if you regularly take aspirin or anti-inflammatory medicines.","You cannot prevent an ulcer caused by an H. pylori infection. However, you can reduce your risks by limiting aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicines. Avoid foods that are acidic (orange juice) and spicy to reduce discomfort. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.","Several other medicines can be used to help treat ulcers. Two types of medicines (H2 blockers and PPIs) reduce the amount of acid that your stomach makes. Over-the-counter antacid medicine provides temporary relief. Smoking and alcohol make the discomfort worse. In severe cases, you may need surgery. Ulcers get worse without treatment. If aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicine irritates your stomach, your doctor may suggest the medicine, misoprostol.","If you have an ulcer, avoid the things that make your ulcer symptoms worse. This means to avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and smoking. If you take aspirin or ibuprofen for chronic pain, talk to your doctor. They may suggest an alternative. Keep your diet balanced. Try eating small, frequent meals when you’re having pain.","• How can I tell the difference between an ulcer and the stomach flu?
• Where is my ulcer located?
• Am I at risk of getting multiple ulcers?
• What are the side effects of ulcer medicines?
• Are ulcers a sign of another health condition?
• Can eating hot stuff give you stomach ulcers?

Your doctor also might suggest triple therapy. This is a combination of 2 antibiotics and a protein pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs are pills that reduce the amount of stomach acid made by glands in the lining of your stomach.

Your doctor might suggest medicines to reduce stomach acids. You may have to take these for up to 8 weeks."
442,Undescended Testicles,https://familydoctor.org/condition/undescended-testicles/,"Testicles are part of the male body. They make male hormones and sperm. Most men have two testicles, located in their scrotum.

While male babies are growing in their mother’s uterus, their testicles are inside their abdomen. Usually, the testicles move down into the scrotum right before or after birth. An undescended testicle occurs when it doesn’t move down into the scrotum.

Undescended testicles are common. Up to 30% of premature male babies have at least one undescended testicle. The rate decreases to 3% to 5% in full-term male babies. An undescended testicle will often move down on its own in the first few months. If this doesn’t happen after about 6 to 9 months, it may require treatment.","In most cases, there are no symptoms that occur with an undescended testicle. The only sign is the absence of one or both testicles in the scrotum.","Most of the time, the cause of an undescended testicle is unknown. Some babies have retractile testes. This is caused when a muscle reflex pulls the testicle up out of the scrotum. Other babies may have a testicle that is too small to locate by exam. A baby may be missing one or both testicles completely. This is caused by a developmental issue during pregnancy.","An undescended testicle is often diagnosed during a child’s newborn exam. The doctor will feel the baby’s scrotum to see if both testes are there. If your doctor can’t feel at least one inside the scrotum, it’s important to find out the cause. Your doctor may perform an ultrasound or CT scan to try and locate the testicle","You can’t prevent or avoid an undescended testicle. There are several reasons to treat an undescended testicle. First, undescended testicles may not make sperm. Testicles are in the scrotum because the temperature is cooler there than it is inside the body. A cooler temperature helps the testicles make sperm. A baby boy with an undescended testicle can start to lose the ability to make sperm by 12 months of age. Second, an undescended testicle is more likely to develop a tumor. When the testicle is inside the scrotum, a doctor can feel it to check for a tumor. This leads to early detection and treatment of testicular cancer. Getting the testicle down into the scrotum early in life can lead to better outcomes. There are several treatment options for an undescended testicle. For babies who have retractile testes, the testicle will often descend on its own. Hormone therapy is one type of treatment. It involves injections (shots) of a hormone called hCG. This helps the testicles make male hormones (testosterone). A higher level of male hormones may move the testicle down into the scrotum. If the testicle hasn’t come down by the time your baby is 9 months old, the doctor may suggest surgery. The operation is called orchiopexy. The surgeon makes a small cut in the groin to bring down the testicle. The surgery and healing time are short. If you’re an adult with an undescended testicle, the surgeon will likely remove it. This is because moving the testicle down at this point won’t improve your ability to make sperm. Removing it also may lower your risk of cancer. An undescended testicle can be cured. Sometimes, it can descend on its own. Other times, your doctor may recommend medicine or surgery to treat the issue. An undescended testicle that is left untreated can lead to future health problems. These include an increased risk of infertility and cancer.",null,null,"• How do I know if my baby boy has an undescended testicle?

443,Urinary Incontinence,https://familydoctor.org/condition/urinary-incontinence/,"Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control. This means that you can’t always control when you urinate. Urinary incontinence can range from leaking a small amount of urine (such as when coughing or laughing) to having very strong urges to urinate that are difficult to control. This can be embarrassing but talk to your doctor about it. It can be treated.

Millions of adults in the United States have urinary incontinence. It’s most common in people older than 50 years of age, especially women. Aging can reduce how much urine your bladder can hold. It can make your stream of urine weaker and can cause you to feel the urge to urinate more often. This doesn’t mean you’ll have urinary incontinence just because you’re aging. With treatment, it can be controlled or cured. Urinary incontinence But can also occur in younger people, especially women who have just given birth.

Be sure to talk to your doctor if you have this problem. If you hide your incontinence, you risk getting rashes, sores, skin infections and urinary tract infections. Also, you may find yourself avoiding friends and family because of fear and embarrassment.

Kegel exercises help strengthen the muscles that control the bladder. They can be done anywhere, any time. Although designed for women, the Kegel exercises can also help men. It may take 3 to 6 months to see an improvement.

Bladder training (timed voiding) is a way of learning to manage urinary incontinence. It is generally used for stress incontinence, urge incontinence, or a combination of the 2 types (mixed incontinence).

Bladder training can help in the following ways:

• Lengthen the amount of time between bathroom trips
• Increase the amount of urine your bladder can hold
• Improve your control over the urge to urinate

Other ways to treat urinary incontinence include medicines or the use of medical devices. For example, estrogen cream inserted in the vagina can be helpful for some women who have mild stress incontinence. Several prescription medicines are available to treat urge incontinence. For men, prescription medicine is available to shrink the prostate and improve flow of urine through the prostate. Medical devices that deliver biofeedback or electrical nerve stimulation can be effective. Talk to your doctor about possible options for your type of incontinence, including a combination treatment approach.

In some cases, surgery may be an option. Treatment depends on what type of urinary incontinence you have and what is causing it.",There are 5 types of urinary incontinence:,"Urinary incontinence can be caused by many different medical problems, including weak pelvic muscles or diabetes. Some common causes include:

• For women, thinning and drying of the skin in the vagina or urethra, especially after menopause
• For men, enlarged prostate gland or prostate surgery
• Weakened and stretched pelvic muscles after childbirth
• Certain medicines
• Build-up of stool in the bowels
• Overweight and obesity, which increases pressure on the bladder and muscles that control the bladder
• Urinary tract infections
• Vascular disease
• Diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis
• Aging
• Dementia",It is important to talk to your family doctor about your symptoms. This is the best way for your doctor to determine which type of urinary incontinence you have. Your doctor may also request a sample of urine. You may need to keep a diary of your urination habits (when you go and how much). Your doctor may order a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate your bladder. Your doctor will use all this information to determine your type of urinary incontinence.,"You may be able to prevent urinary incontinence by working to keep pelvic muscles strong. But even so, it doesn’t guarantee that you will never have urinary incontinence.

There are also lifestyle changes you can make to prevent urinary incontinence. You may find it helpful to make some changes in your diet. Alcohol, caffeine, foods high in acid (such as tomato or grapefruit), and spicy foods can irritate your bladder. Talk to your doctor if you think your diet may contribute to your incontinence.

Some people find that limiting how much they drink before bedtime helps reduce nighttime incontinence.

Losing weight if you are overweight can also help reduce incontinence.","Treatment depends on what’s causing the problem and what type of incontinence you have. If your urinary incontinence is caused by a medical problem, the incontinence will go away when the problem is treated. Kegel exercises and bladder training help some types of incontinence through strengthening the pelvic muscles. Medicine and surgery are other options.","Do not let urinary incontinence control your life. Do not let it keep you at home or affect your typical activities. All it takes is a little planning. For example, if you know you are going to not be near a bathroom, consider using a panty liner or pad. When you are at an event away from home, scope out the locations of bathrooms. Take frequent bathroom breaks. Try to drink less while you are out.

Most importantly, talk to your doctor and those close to you about your urinary incontinence. You may be embarrassed at first, but they can help you work on solutions—especially your doctor. It is important to know that you aren’t alone in this.","• What type of urinary incontinence do I have?
• What is the likely cause of my urinary incontinence? Can this condition be treated?
• If so, will treating the condition cure my urinary incontinence? When can I expect relief from my symptoms?
• Should I start doing Kegel exercises? How often?
• Would a bladder training program help manage my urinary incontinence?
• Will any lifestyle changes help manage my urinary incontinence?
• I’m embarrassed by my urinary incontinence.

This may happen when you cough, laugh, lift something, or exercise. Stress incontinence usually occurs when the pelvic muscles are weakened, for example, by childbirth or surgery. Stress incontinence is common in women.

This occurs when the need to urinate comes on very suddenly, often before you can get to a toilet. Your body may only give you a warning of a few seconds to minutes before you urinate. Urge incontinence is most common in the elderly and may be a sign of a urinary tract infection or an overactive bladder.

This type of incontinence is the uncontrollable leakage of small amounts of urine. It’s caused by an overfilled bladder. You may feel like you can’t empty your bladder all the way and you may strain when urinating. This often occurs in men and can be caused by something blocking the urinary flow, such as an enlarged prostate gland or tumor. Diabetes or certain medicines may also cause the problem.

This type occurs when you have normal urine control but have trouble getting to the bathroom in time. You may not be able to get to the bathroom because of arthritis or other diseases that make it hard to move around.

This type involves having more than one of the types of incontinence listed above."
444,Urinary Tract Infection (UTI),https://familydoctor.org/condition/urinary-tract-infections/,"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the kidneys, the bladder and the urethra. The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs that lie against the spine in the lower back. As blood flows through the kidneys, they remove waste and store it in the bladder as urine. The bladder is the balloon-like organ located in the pelvis, which is between your abdomen and thighs. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder and out of the body. Common UTI symptoms can include a strong urge to urinate that doesn’t go away or a burning feeling while urinating.

A painful burning feeling when you urinate is often a sign of a urinary tract infection (sometimes also called a bladder infection). However, painful urination can occur even if you don’t have an infection. Certain drugs, like some used in cancer chemotherapy, may inflame the bladder. Something pressing against the bladder (like an ovarian cyst) or a kidney stone stuck near the entrance to the bladder can also cause painful urination.

Painful urination can also be caused by vaginal infection or irritation. You might be sensitive to chemicals in products such as douches, vaginal lubricants, soaps, scented toilet paper, or contraceptive foams or sponges. If it hurts to urinate after you’ve used these products, you’re probably sensitive to them.","Sometimes germs can grow in the urinary tract but you won’t have any symptoms. This is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Your doctor can test to find out if you have this. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated in pregnant women, but does not need to be treated in most other women.

Possible signs of a urinary tract infection include the following:

• A burning sensation or pain when you urinate
• Feeling like you need to urinate more often than usual
• Feeling the urge to urinate but not being able to
• Leaking a little urine
• Cloudy, dark, smelly or bloody urine

In a child, UTI symptoms may include any of the symptoms listed above and may also include:

• Fever
• Diarrhea
• Vomiting
• Irritability or fussiness
• Being less active
• Stomach pain
• Back pain
• Wets his or her clothes even though he or she is potty trained

Yes. Painful urination can be a symptom of a more serious problem. You should tell your doctor about your UTI symptoms and how long you’ve had them. Tell your doctor about any medical conditions you have, such as diabetes mellitus or AIDS, because these could affect your body’s response to infection. Tell your doctor about any known abnormality in your urinary tract, and if you are or might be pregnant. Tell your doctor if you’ve had any procedures or surgeries on your urinary tract. He or she also need to know if you were recently hospitalized (less than 1 month ago) or stayed in a nursing home.

If your doctor thinks your pain may be from vaginal inflammation, he or she may wipe the lining of your vagina with a swab to collect mucus. The mucus will be looked at under a microscope to see if it has yeast or other organisms. If your pain is from an infection in your urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder), your doctor may swab it to test for bacteria. If an infection can’t be found, your doctor may suggest other tests.

If the treatment isn’t working, your UTI symptoms will stay the same, get worse, or you will develop new symptoms. Call your doctor if you have a fever (higher than 100.5 degrees), chills, lower stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. You should also call your doctor if, after taking medicine for 3 days, you still have a burning feeling when you urinate. If you are pregnant, you should also call your doctor if you have any contractions.","UTIs are caused by bacteria (germs) that get into the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Any part of your urinary tract can become infected, but bladder and urethra infections are the most common.

Yes, sometimes a UTI can damage the kidneys. It’s important to seek treatment right away if you think you or your child has a UTI.","Your doctor will usually be able to tell what’s causing your pain by your description of your symptoms, along with a physical exam. Testing your urine (urinalysis) can also help your doctor identify what type of infection you have. Usually, a sample of your urine is taken in your doctor’s office and sent to a lab to check for infection.","There are many lifestyle choices that can help you prevent UTIs. These are some of the things you can do to protect yourself from them:

• Drink plenty of water to flush out bacteria. For some people, drinking cranberry juice may also help prevent urinary tract infections. However, if you’re taking warfarin, check with your doctor before using cranberry juice to prevent urinary tract infections. Your doctor may need to adjust your warfarin dose or you may need to have more frequent blood tests.
• Don’t hold your urine. Urinate when you feel like you need to. Some children don’t go to the bathroom often enough. If your child does this, teach him or her to go to the bathroom several times each day.
• Wipe from front to back after bowel movements. Teach your child to wipe correctly.
• Urinate after having sex to help wash away bacteria.
• Use enough lubrication during sex. Try using a small amount of lubricant (such as K-Y Jelly) before sex if you’re a little dry.
• If you get urinary tract infections often, you may want to avoid using a diaphragm as a birth control method. Ask your doctor about other birth control choices.
• Avoid taking or giving your child bubble baths.
• Wear loose-fitting clothing (including underpants), and dress your child in loose-fitting clothing.
• If you are uncircumcised, wash the foreskin regularly. If you have an uncircumcised boy, teach him how to wash his foreskin.","If you are a healthy adult man or a woman who is not pregnant, a few days of antibiotic pills will usually cure your urinary tract infection. If you are pregnant, your doctor will prescribe a medicine that is safe for you and the baby. Usually, symptoms of the infection go away 1 to 2 days after you start taking the medicine. It’s important that you follow your doctor’s instructions for taking the medicine, even if you start to feel better. Skipping pills could make the treatment less effective.

Your doctor may also suggest a medicine to numb your urinary tract and make you feel better while the antibiotic starts to work. The medicine makes your urine turn bright orange, so don’t be alarmed by the color when you urinate.","If you have 3 or more urinary tract infections each year, your doctor may want you to begin a preventive antibiotic program. A small dose of an antibiotic taken every day helps to reduce the number of infections. If sexual intercourse seems to cause infections for you, your doctor many suggest taking the antibiotic after intercourse.","• Do I need any tests, such as urinalysis?
• What is the likely cause of my urinary tract infection (UTI)?
• Do I need medicine? How should I take it?
• What are the possible side effects of the medicine?
• When should I expect relief from my UTI symptoms?
• What UTI symptoms would indicate that my infection is getting worse? What should I do if I experience these symptoms?
• I get UTIs a lot. What can I do to prevent them?
• Do I need preventive antibiotics? If so, should I be concerned about antibiotic resistance?

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Women tend to get urinary tract infections more often than men because bacteria can reach the bladder more easily in women. The urethra (the opening to your urinary tract) is shorter in women than in men, so bacteria have a shorter distance to travel.

The urethra is located near the rectum in women. Bacteria from the rectum can easily travel up the urethra and cause infections. Bacteria from the rectum is more likely to get into the urethra if you wipe from back to front (instead of front to back) after a bowel movement. Be sure to teach children how to wipe correctly.

Having sex may also cause urinary tract infections in women because bacteria can be pushed into the urethra. Using a diaphragm can lead to infections because diaphragms push against the urethra and make it harder to completely empty your bladder. The urine that stays in the bladder is more likely to grow bacteria and cause infections.

Frequent urinary tract infections may be caused by changes in the bacteria in the vagina. Antibacterial vaginal douches, spermicides, and certain oral antibiotics may cause changes in vaginal bacteria. Avoid using these items, if possible. Menopause can also cause changes in vaginal bacteria that increase your risk for urinary tract infection. Taking estrogen usually corrects this problem but may not be for everyone.

If you have a UTI and it isn’t treated, it may lead to a kidney infection. Kidney infections may cause early labor. Fortunately, asymptomatic bacteriuria and bladder infections are usually found and treated before the kidneys become infected. If your doctor treats a urinary tract infection early and properly, it won’t hurt your baby.

You doctor may want to check to see if an anatomical (physical) problem is causing the UTIs. If so, surgery may be needed to fix the problem. Some children who have bladder or kidney problems have to take medicine every day so they won’t get another UTI."
445,Uterine Fibroids,https://familydoctor.org/condition/uterine-fibroids/,"Fibroids are benign growths (not cancer) in the muscular wall of the uterus. These growths can be very tiny or as large as a cantaloupe.

Fibroids are very common. Between 20% and 80% of women develop fibroids by the time they reach 50 years of age. Most women get uterine fibroids in their 40s and 50s, and many women have them without knowing it.

Once a fibroid is formed, it tends to grow larger until menopause. After menopause, fibroids tend to shrink because women have less estrogen at that stage of their lives.","Many women who have fibroids don’t have symptoms. In other women, fibroids can cause heavy bleeding during the menstrual period. Periods may last much longer than usual. Fibroids may also cause pain or a feeling of pressure or heaviness in the lower pelvic area (the area between the hip bones), the back or the legs. Some women have pain during sexual intercourse. Others have a constant feeling that they need to urinate. There may also be a feeling of pressure in the bowel. Some women have constipation or bloating. Uterine fibroids can also cause infertility as well as complications during pregnancy and labor.","Doctors do not know what causes uterine fibroids. Some researchers believe they may be genetic (run in families). Other researchers think they could be related to hormone levels.

Other factors that can increase a woman’s risk of developing uterine fibroids include:

• Fibroids are common as women age, especially as they approach menopause.
• Ethnic origin.Black women are more likely to develop fibroids than white women.
• Women who are overweight are at higher risk for fibroids. For heavy women, the risk is two to three times greater than average.
• Eating habits.Eating a lot of red meat (e.g., beef) and ham is linked with a higher risk of fibroids. Eating plenty of green vegetables seems to protect women from developing fibroids.","Even if you have no symptoms, your doctor may discover that you have fibroids during a routine pelvic exam. They may be able to feel the fibroids during the exam and even estimate the size.

Your doctor also may order imaging tests to confirm the diagnosis. Or they may suggest looking inside you with a scope. This can be done through laparoscopy or hysteroscopy. In laparoscopy, your doctor will make a small incision (cut) near your navel and insert the scope. In hysteroscopy, your doctor will insert the scope into your vagina and cervix (no incision needed).","Because doctors don’t know for sure what causes them, uterine fibroids cannot be completely prevented or avoided. However, lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and eat less red meat, can help reduce your risk.","There are many treatment options for women who have fibroids. Fibroids that don’t cause any symptoms may not need treatment. For fibroids that do cause symptoms, treatment options include medicine, noninvasive or minimally invasive procedures, or traditional surgery. Your doctor will help you figure out the best treatment option for your fibroid.

Your doctor will consider many things before helping you choose a treatment. Some of these things include:

• Whether or not you are having symptoms from the fibroids
• If you might want to become pregnant in the future
• The size of the fibroids
• The location of the fibroids
• Your age and how close to menopause you might be

Medicines don’t get rid of fibroids, but they can help control symptoms and make fibroids smaller.

Your doctor may recommend a noninvasive or minimally invasive procedure to remove or destroy the fibroid.

A noninvasive procedure means that your doctor does not have to make an incision (cut your skin) to destroy or remove the fibroid. MRI-guided focused ultrasound therapy is a new, noninvasive way of treating fibroids. During this procedure, you lie in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner while it takes pictures of your uterus. The scanner shows your doctor exactly where the fibroid is. Your doctor then points ultrasound (sound waves) at the fibroid. The ultrasound waves heat up and destroy the fibroid. This is the least invasive procedure for treating fibroids but not every patient is a candidate for it. Your doctor can help you determine if it would work for you.

A minimally invasive procedure means that your doctor makes only a very small incision (cut) in your skin to destroy or remove the fibroid. Minimally invasive procedures include the following:

• Uterine fibroid embolization(also called uterine artery embolization): Fibroids will shrink or go away completely if their blood supply is stopped. During uterine fibroid embolization, the doctor injects tiny particles into the arteries that supply blood to the fibroids. These particles stop the blood flow to the fibroid. Over time, the fibroid will shrink. The procedure works even if you have several fibroids.
• Myomectomy: During this procedure, your doctor surgically removes the fibroids from your uterus. The surgical tools are inserted in the body either through very small cuts in the abdomen, or through the vagina and cervix.","It is very possible to live your life without even knowing you have uterine fibroids. If you have symptoms, you and your doctor can discuss a treatment plan to manage symptoms or remove the fibroids.

If you are planning to become pregnant, talk to your doctor. Uterine fibroids can cause problems during pregnancy and delivery for some women. Other women experience no problems with it.","• What could have caused my uterine fibroid(s)?
• How large is/are my uterine fibroid(s)?
• Does my uterine fibroid require treatment?
• Could I choose not to have the fibroid removed?
• I’d like to spare my uterus. Is uterine fibroid embolization a good treatment option for me?
• Do uterine fibroids put me at risk for any other health conditions?
• Is it safe for me to exercise? What about sexual activity?","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development: Uterine Fibroids

This Uterine Health Guide is here to help you better understand it all.

If you have a number of fibroids or fibroids that are very large, your doctor may recommend a hysterectomy. During a hysterectomy, your doctor removes the entire uterus from your body. A hysterectomy can be done through an abdominal incision (cut) or through a vaginal incision."
446,Vaginal Discharge,https://familydoctor.org/condition/vaginal-discharge/,"Glands inside your vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. Vaginal discharge is completely normal. This is your body’s way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean.

Small amounts of yeast fungus are often found in a healthy vagina. But if too much grows, it can cause a yeast infection. Yeast infections usually aren’t caught from a sex partner. You may be more likely to get a yeast infection if you are using antibiotics, are pregnant, have diabetes, or stay hot and sweaty for long periods. Some women get frequent yeast infections for no obvious reason.

Bacterial vaginosis is usually caused by Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria. Why some women get this infection isn’t clear. It’s probably not caught from a sex partner.

Trichomoniasis is caused by an organism called Trichomonas vaginalis. You can be infected but have no signs for a long time. Trichomoniasis is usually caught by having sex without a condom with someone who is infected.","Vaginal discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn’t smell bad. The color and thickness of the discharge change with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when you breastfeed, or when you’re sexually excited.

Changes that may signal a problem include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness, or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that’s stained with blood when you’re not having your period could also be a sign of a problem. If you have any of these signs, you should talk to your doctor.

You should also be on the lookout for symptoms of yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis. These are 3 different infections that can cause changes in your vaginal discharge

• White, cottage cheese-like discharge
• Swelling and pain around the vulva
• Intense itching
• Painful sexual intercourse

• A white, gray, or yellow discharge
• A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap
• Itching or burning
• Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva

• A watery, yellow discharge or greenish bubbly discharge
• An unpleasant odor
• Pain and itching when urinating
• Most apparent after your period","Vaginal discharge is a completely normal part of how your body maintains a healthy vagina. But changes can occur if the normal balance of healthy bacteria (germs) in your vagina is upset. Many things can disturb the balance of a healthy vagina, including:

• Douching (cleaning the vagina with a liquid solution)
• Feminine hygiene sprays
• Certain soaps or bubble baths
• Antibiotics
• Diabetes
• Pregnancy
• Infections","If your vaginal discharge increases, changes color or odor, or is suddenly itchy or irritated, see your doctor. You may have a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis. Your doctor will need to examine you to make a diagnosis. The exam will include questions about your symptoms. Your doctor will also perform a pelvic exam to look for swelling and discharge. Your doctor will probably also collect a sample of the discharge to send to the lab.","There is no need to prevent normal vaginal discharge. However, abnormal vaginal discharge may be prevented by following these tips.

• After using the toilet, always wipe from front to back. This may help prevent getting bacteria from your rectal area into your vagina.
• Wear cotton underpants during the day. Cotton allows your genital area to “breathe.” Don’t wear underpants at night.
• Avoid wearing tight pants, pantyhose, swimming suits, biking shorts, or leotards for long periods.
• Change your laundry detergent or fabric softener if you think it may be irritating your genital area.
• The latex in condoms and diaphragms and the sperm-killing gels that are used for birth control can be irritating for some women. If you think one of these things is a problem for you, talk to your doctor about other types of birth control.
• Avoid hot tubs.
• Bathe or shower daily and pat your genital area dry.
• Don’t douche.
• Avoid feminine hygiene sprays, colored or perfumed toilet paper, deodorant pads or tampons, and bubble bath.","There are different treatment methods, depending on what is causing the abnormal vaginal discharge.

Yeast infections are usually treated with a medicine you put into your vagina. Yeast infections can also be treated with oral medicine.

If you have yeast infections often, your doctor may suggest you use a medicine you can buy without a prescription. But if you have any questions about what’s causing your vaginitis, you should call your doctor. Many other things besides a yeast infection can cause vaginitis.

Bacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotic medicine, usually a pill.

It’s usually treated with oral antibiotics.

Sometimes. Talk to your doctor if you’re sexually active. You may also need to avoid having sex or use condoms until you’ve been treated.","Abnormal vaginal discharge is completely treatable. However, it may reoccur— sometimes with regularity. Some women suffer from frequent yeast infections. Vaginosis can also keep coming back. If so, talk to your doctor. It could mean you need a longer treatment period.","• What is the likely cause of the changes in my vaginal discharge?

Douching can also spread an infection into the uterus, increasing your risk of getting pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the fallopian tubes that can cause you to be unable to have children.

Douching isn’t necessary to keep your body clean. Smells you may notice usually come from outside the vagina (vulva). Keeping this area clean with gentle soap and water can prevent smells.

Two sexually transmitted infections, chlamydia and gonorrhea, can also cause vaginal discharge. These are infections of the cervix caused by bacteria. Sometimes the only symptom may be an increase of vaginal discharge. Both of these infections can be treated with antibiotic shots or pills."

• Vaginal itching
• Burning
• Discharge

Other symptoms could include bad-smelling discharge, colored discharge, redness, or burning during urination.

Most women will have vaginitis at some point in their lives. It is normally a mild problem that can be treated and cured easily. If left untreated, it could cause complications:

• Having BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk of getting an STI.
• If you’re pregnant, BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk of preterm labor or birth.
• Untreated BV could cause more serious infections to spread to the uterus or fallopian tubes.

Some women experience recurrent infections. Talk to your doctor if your problem becomes chronic. They may be able to suggest lifestyle changes that can help you.

The most common include:,"Your doctor will ask you about your health history. They will do a pelvic exam. They will examine the vulva, the vagina, and the cervix. They will look for abnormal discharge from the vagina. They may look at a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscope. They might do additional tests for specific causes, such as a sexually transmitted infection (STI).","Vaginitis is common and can be hard to prevent. But there are actions you can take to reduce your risk of getting it:

• Avoid clothes that hold in heat and moisture. This includes tight pants and non-cotton underwear.
• Do not douche. This introduces a foreign substance into your vagina. It could disrupt the natural balance of bacteria or yeast and cause infection.
• Limit your number of sexual partners. This can reduce exposure to new sources of germs that can cause vaginitis.
• Use condoms. When you have sex, use condoms. They can reduce the amount of new bacteria or other germs that can enter your vagina.
• Keep sex toys clean. Clean any sex toys immediately after use. Never share sex toys with other people.
• See your doctor. If you are showing signs of vaginitis, see your doctor.","Your treatment will depend on what is causing the vaginitis.

• Bacterial vaginosis –This can be treated with antibiotics. These may be in pill form that you take by mouth. Or it could be a cream or gel you insert directly in your vagina.
• Yeast infection –This is usually treated with cream that you insert into your vagina. You can buy it over the counter but talk to your doctor first. They can make sure it is a yeast infection and not another kind of vaginitis. Sometimes yeast infections are treated with pills that you swallow.
• Trichomoniasis –This is typically treated with a single-dose antibiotic. Because this is an STI, your partner should be treated, too.

• Douching
• Having a new sexual partner
• Having multiple sexual partners
• Having unprotected sex
• Smoking cigarettes
• Using an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control
• Taking antibiotics

Common symptoms of BV include a thin white or gray discharge, and a fish-like odor. Some women with BV don’t have any symptoms.

These happen when the natural acid in your vagina decreases. This allows yeast (candida) to grow and cause an infection. The acidic imbalance of the vagina can be changed by:

• Your period
• Pregnancy
• Diabetes
• Douching
• Antibiotics
• Birth control pills
• Steroids

A common symptom of yeast infections is a thick, white discharge. Sometimes it can look like cottage cheese. Sometimes it is watery. It often does not smell. In addition, the vulva and vagina are often red and itchy.

This is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by a parasite that is spread between sexual partners.

Common symptoms of trichomoniasis include itching, burning, and soreness in the vagina and vulva. You could feel burning during urination. Some women have a gray-green discharge that could smell bad.

You could have an allergic reaction to a product you use, such as douches, soaps, fabric softeners, or spermicides.

448,Varicose Veins,https://familydoctor.org/condition/varicose-veins/,"Varicose veins are veins that swell above the surface of the skin. They may be twisted and are often blue or dark purple. Varicose veins are mostly found on the legs or feet, but they can be found on the groin. Those that you see are just under the surface of the skin. There are often deeper and larger varicose veins that you can’t see. Hemorrhoids are a form of varicose veins in the rectal area.","Varicose veins can be painful and include several symptoms such as:

• A feeling of heaviness or tiredness in the legs
• Aching or throbbing were varicose veins are present
• Swelling of the feet, ankles, and lower legs that gets worse throughout the day, but goes down overnight or if you elevate your legs (this swelling is called venous stasis)
• Itchy skin
• In severe cases, ulcers or blood clots may develop

If you begin to have any of these symptoms, let your doctor know immediately.","Varicose veins do not increase your risk of dangerous blood clots. These clots form in veins deep inside your legs or arms. They can also form in varicose veins. These can be treated by your doctor with warm compresses or medicines.

Veins return blood back to the heart so that it can be recirculated to the rest of your body. There are valves in your veins that allow the blood to flow toward the heart. In some people, the valves may stop working correctly (often because the valves have stretched over the years). This can allow blood to flow back down into the veins. Blood then pools in the veins, causing them to swell even more. The veins in your legs are vulnerable because they work against gravity to get the blood back to your heart. This is why most varicose veins are found in the legs.","Your doctor often will be able to diagnose varicose veins simply by examining your legs. Other times, your doctor may order tests to look at how well your blood is flowing before diagnosing you.","Some people are more at risk for developing varicose veins. Risk factors include:

• Genetics: Varicose veins tend to run in families.
• Gender: Women are at greater risk of developing varicose veins.
• Pregnancy: Hormonal changes, pressure from the uterus, and increased blood volume make varicose veins common during pregnancy.
• Age: The risk for varicose veins increases with age. About 50% of people over the age of 50 have varicose veins.
• Obesity: Being overweight puts additional pressure on your veins.
• Job: If your work means you must stand for long periods of time without moving around, you are more likely to get varicose veins.

There are several things you can do at home to improve the symptoms of varicose veins:

• Lose weight, if you are overweight.
• Avoid standing for long periods of time.
• Raise your legs while you are sitting. If possible, keep them above the level of your heart.
• Wear loose clothing.","Your doctor may recommend that you wear compression stockings. These are stockings that provide gentle, consistent pressure. This will help keep blood from pooling in your legs and reduce swelling from venous stasis when you are sitting or standing. Compression stockings can be found at pharmacies and medical supply stores.

If your symptoms don’t get any better with at-home care, or if you don’t like the way varicose veins look, there are more invasive treatment options available.

450,Vision Loss,https://familydoctor.org/condition/vision-loss/,"Vision loss is losing your ability to see well without some sort of vision correction. Vision correction tools include eyeglasses, contact lenses, permanent artificial lenses, or surgical correction to the eye. Vision loss can happen gradually (slowly over time) or suddenly. You may have partial vision loss or complete loss of vision.","You may have vision problems if you have trouble with normal activities, such as reading mail, watching television, signing your name, paying bills, or walking up and down stairs. You might also have trouble recognizing people. You may notice that you squint a lot in order to see things clearly.","Vision changes, such as trouble focusing on close objects, are a normal part of aging. The main causes of vision loss in people older than 40 years of age are:

• Macular degeneration. This is caused by changes in the macula. The macula is the part of the eye that gives you clear, sharp vision.
• Glaucoma. This is usually caused by high pressure from the fluid inside the eye.
• This is caused by a clouding of the lens inside the eye.
• Diabetic retinopathy. This affects people who have diabetes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the eyes.

Other common causes of vision loss include injury, infections, and vision changes associated with certain illnesses.","You may not realize that your vision is getting worse. This is especially true if it is happening gradually. It may be that someone close to you is the first to notice that you’re not seeing well.

Visit your doctor if vision problems keep you from doing your normal activities. They can recommend the right treatment for you, depending on what is causing your vision loss.","Vision loss may be prevented, depending on what is causing it. For example, you may prevent diabetic retinopathy by preventing type 2 diabetes. You may be able to prevent cataracts by wearing polarized sunglasses when you’re outside. However, you generally can’t prevent age-related vision loss.","Your doctor can help you find specialists to treat your vision problems. For many patients, a team approach is the best way to treat vision loss. Some of the specialists your doctor may recommend include:

• An ophthalmologist to treat the eye disease causing the vision problems.
• An optometrist to manage the vision problems. This type of doctor can prescribe optical aids, such as special magnifiers.
• A physical therapist to help you with balance and walking problems, and to teach you how to use a cane if you need one.
• An occupational therapist to help you with normal daily activities and to teach you how to use optical aids.
• A social worker or therapist to help you cope with the emotional issues of vision loss.","There are many corrective tools that can help you see when you’re progressively losing your vision. Sometimes, there are even surgical options that can remove the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses.

Sometimes vision loss can’t be corrected. Some forms of vision loss can leave you blind. This can have a dramatic impact on your life. There are many resources that can help you adjust to vision loss, including the American Foundation for the Blind. You may also want to speak with a therapist to process the emotions of your vision loss. Many people with vision loss lead productive lives with meaningful relationships.","• Do I have a disease that is causing my vision loss?
• Can my vision loss be treated?

451,Vitiligo | Symptoms and Treatment,https://familydoctor.org/condition/vitiligo/,"Vitiligo is a skin-coloring disorder. It produces white patches on your skin. It mostly occurs in areas that are exposed to the sun. This includes your face, neck, arms, hands, legs, and feet. It can affect your mouth, nose, and eyes. It also can affect unexposed parts, like your genitals. People of any age and race can get vitiligo.","The main sign of vitiligo are white patches of skin. It’s more common to have patches that are symmetric on both sides of your body. Or you may have white patches on only one side of your body. Vitiligo may or may not spread over time.

Other symptoms of vitiligo can include:

• White skin hairs where your skin is white.
• Early onset of gray or white hair on your head (less than 35 years of age).
• White eyebrows, eyelashes, or beard.
• White patches in your mouth (mainly in people who have a naturally darker skin color).

Vitiligo is not physically harmful, but it can have emotional and mental effects. Talk to your doctor about joining a support group or getting counseling. This can help you cope and manage possible depression.

Be careful about exposing your skin in the sun. Your white patches are extra sensitive because the skin cells are dead. Other parts of your body may become sensitive to the sun with treatment. Sun exposure can increase the contrast between your skin colors. Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 that protects against UVA and UVB. Wear sunscreen every time you’re in the sun to try to reduce your risk of sunburn and skin cancer.

Stay away from tanning beds. They won’t help return color to your white patches.

Choose a symptom and answer simple questions using our physician-reviewed Symptom Checker to find a possible diagnosis for your health issue.","Vitiligo occurs when skin cells that produce pigment (color) die. It causes white patches on areas of your skin. No one knows exactly why these skin cells die. Most scientists believe it is caused by an autoimmune disorder. This means the body’s immune system attacks and causes the death of the skin pigment cells. People who have other autoimmune disorders, such as certain types of hyperthyroidism, may have an increased risk of vitiligo. There is some evidence that genetics plays a role in this process. Some people may inherit an increased risk of developing vitiligo from their parents.","See your doctor if you think you have vitiligo. He or she will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. He or she will ask about your health and family history. Your doctor may do a biopsy on your skin. This consists of sending a sample of skin cells to a lab to look at the cells. It can confirm the disease if your cells lack melanocytes, which produce pigment. Your doctor also may do a blood test. This can check for the presence of an autoimmune disorder.","It’s hard to avoid or remove vitiligo, since the cause is unknown. However, you should take care of your skin to protect it from the sun. This includes using a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or more. You should also cover your skin and limit sun exposure.","There are treatment options for vitiligo. They depend on how severe your condition is. This includes the size, location, and number of white patches. The goal of treatment is largely cosmetic. Most people do it to improve their appearance and feel better about themselves

Forms of treatment are time consuming. They’re not guaranteed to work or last, though they can be permanent. They also don’t prevent new patches from appearing.

Treatment options come in the following forms:

This involves applying a cream to the white patches. It contains corticosteroids. The topical cream may return color, or pigment, to your white patches. It may not return full color, depending on your natural skin tone. Possible side effects include skin lines, wrinkles, or shrinkage.

This is a type of light therapy. Psoralen is a chemical that primes your skin. You can take pills by mouth or apply cream to your skin. Then, you receive monitored exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The psoralen and UVA react to stimulate new skin cells. The goal is to return color to your white patches. This type of treatment has a lot of side effects. The psoralen can cause nausea, vomiting, itching, a rash, or abnormal hair growth. The exposure can cause sunburn or hyperpigmentation (too much color). It also can increase your risk of skin cancer.

This treatment is most common for people who have white patches on more than 50% of their bodies. It involves de-coloring, or fading, your natural skin tone to match your white patches. Treatment consists of applying cream to your skin 1 to 2 times a day. You can do this until all of your skin is similar in color. The main side effect is swollen skin, known as eczema. The symptoms are red, itchy, and dry skin.

This can be used if other treatments don’t work. During surgery, your doctor removes skin from an area of your body that still has color. That skin is then transplanted (grafted) on the white patches. This option works best if you have small white patches.

In addition to medical options, you can use cosmetics to cover your skin. This includes makeup, creams, dyes, or self-tanning lotions. Talk with your doctor about which treatment is best for you.",null,"• Why do I have vitiligo?

452,Vomiting and Diarrhea,https://familydoctor.org/condition/vomiting-and-diarrhea/,"Vomiting (throwing up) and diarrhea (watery bowel movements) are common symptoms of gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis is the inflammation and irritation of the stomach and intestines. Vomiting and diarrhea at the same time can be harmful, because they can cause dehydration. Dehydration occurs when you lose too much fluid. Young children and the elderly can become dehydrated quickly, but dehydration can occur at any age.

An oral rehydration solution, or ORS, is a great way to replace fluids and nutrients lost through vomiting and diarrhea. An ORS is safe for babies, children, and adults. An ORS can come in several forms, including a powder that you mix with water, a liquid that is already mixed, and as frozen popsicles. You can purchase these at most grocery stores and drugstores.

To use an ORS for vomiting, try giving small amounts of ORS often, such as 1 teaspoonful every minute. If the person is able to keep the drink down, slowly increase how much you give. If the person vomits after you give the ORS, wait 30 to 60 minutes after the last time he or she vomited, and then give him or her a few sips of an ORS. Small amounts every few minutes may stay down better than a large amount all at once. When the person stops vomiting, you may increase how much of the ORS you give each time and add clear broths or clear sodas. Remember, small amounts are less likely to cause an upset stomach. If a person only has diarrhea and isn’t vomiting, he or she may have an ORS and other liquids as needed. Your doctor may ask you to keep track of how much the child or senior drinks. You can use a dropper, a spoon, or a measuring cup to help you keep track.","Vomiting and diarrhea are usually considered symptoms themselves. You will know you are vomiting when you begin throwing up. You will know you have diarrhea when you begin having watery bowel movements.

The main result or sign of both vomiting and diarrhea is dehydration. It can be hard to tell if a person is dehydrated. Usually, by the time a person has signs of dehydration, they have been dehydrated for a while. If you notice any of the following signs of dehydration, especially in babies, children, and the elderly, talk to your doctor. If dehydration is severe, your loved one may need to be given fluids intravenously (by vein through an IV tube) to replace fluids lost through vomiting or diarrhea.

• Little or lack of urine, or urine that is darker than usual.
• Urinating less frequently than usual (fewer than 6 wet diapers a day for infants and 8 hours or more without urinating for children).
• Thirst (babies may show thirst by crying, being irritable and eager to drink when something is offered).
• Irritability.
• Not eating as well as usual.
• Weight loss.
• Dry mouth.
• No tears when crying.
• In babies who are younger than 18 months old, sunken soft spots on the top of their heads.
• Skin that isn’t as springy or elastic as usual.
• Sleepiness.","Vomiting and diarrhea can be caused by a number of things. These include viruses, bacteria, parasites, certain medicines, or certain medical conditions. Foods that are hard to digest (such as too many sweets) and undercooked (raw or partially raw) meat or fish can also cause vomiting and diarrhea.","Vomiting and diarrhea can be diagnosed at home. Neither condition requires a trip to the doctor. However, call your doctor if the vomiting and diarrhea don’t seem to be getting better, or if the person who is vomiting and/or has diarrhea:

• Is younger than 6 months old.
• Is older than 6 months old and has a fever higher than 101.4°F.
• Has signs of dehydration (see box above).
• Has been vomiting longer than 8 hours or is vomiting with great force.
• Has blood in his or her stools.
• Has blood in his or her vomit.
• Has not urinated in 8 hours.
• Might have swallowed something that could be poisonous.
• Has a stiff neck or bad headache.
• Is listless or unusually sleepy.
• Has had abdominal pain for more than 2 hours.","Avoiding foods that might be undercooked or raw can prevent vomiting and diarrhea. Since it can be caused by many things, though, it may not always be possible to avoid.","Anyone who has had several bouts of vomiting or diarrhea will need to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.

• For babies: If you are breastfeeding, continue to give your baby breast milk. Breast milk has fluids and electrolytes needed to prevent dehydration. Your doctor may also want you to give your baby an oral rehydration solution (ORS). If you feed your baby formula, try switching to one that is lactose free while your baby is sick. Lactose can make diarrhea worse. Your doctor may also suggest switching from formula to an ORS for 12 to 24 hours, and then switching back.
• For toddlers and young children: Use an ORS, which contains the right mix of salt, sugar, potassium, and other nutrients to help replace lost body fluids. Children older than 1 year may also have clear soups, clear sodas, or juice mixed 50-50 with water to help prevent dehydration. You should avoid giving your child plain water and soft drinks. Water alone does not contain enough salt and nutrients to help with dehydration. Soft drinks are typically very high in sugar and can irritate your child’s stomach.
• For adults and seniors: To replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea, adults and seniors should try to drink at least seven eight-ounce glasses of water each day. Seniors may also use ORS or liquid meal replacements to help replace lost body fluids.","Vomiting and diarrhea usually don’t last long. If it’s caused by an infection, vomiting and diarrhea are a way for the body to get rid of the infection. Giving medicines that stop vomiting and diarrhea may actually interfere with the body’s efforts to heal. Antibiotics are usually not necessary either. Talk to your family doctor if you or a loved one is frequently vomiting or having diarrhea.","• Can vomiting and diarrhea at the same time be the signs of another health condition?
• What, if any, medicines can help treat vomiting and diarrhea?
• What should I do if I think my child has food poisoning?
• My child has frequent diarrhea. Should I be worried?
• My child has diarrhea occasionally. Should I be worried?
• What should I do if my child won’t eat or drink anything when he or she is vomiting or has diarrhea?

453,Vulvar Cancer,https://familydoctor.org/condition/vulvar-cancer/,"The vulva is the skin and fatty tissue between the upper thighs of women. It extends from the area of the anus to about an inch below the pubic hairline. Cancer of the vulva most often affects the two skin folds (or lips) around the vagina, known as the labia.

Vulvar cancer is not very common. However, it is very serious because it is cancer. It can affect a woman’s sexual functioning. It can make sex painful and difficult. If found early, vulvar cancer has a high cure rate and the treatment options involve less surgery.","Tell your doctor if you have any of these warning signs of vulvar cancer:

• Vulvar itching that lasts more than a few weeks
• A cut or sore on the vulva that won’t heal
• A lump or mass on the vulva
• Vulvar pain
• Bleeding from the vulva (different from your usual menstrual bleeding)
• Burning in the genital area that lasts even after your doctor has treated the burning
• Any change in size, color, or texture of a birthmark or mole in the vulvar area","Vulvar cancer most often affects women 65 to 75 years of age. However, it can also occur in women 40 years of age or younger. Vulvar cancer may be related to genital warts, a sexually transmitted disease caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).","If your doctor finds an abnormal area on the vulva, they may want to take a small piece of tissue to look at under a microscope. This procedure can be done in the doctor’s office. It is called a biopsy. A biopsy is the only way to find out if you have vulvar cancer.","Currently, there is no known way to prevent vulvar cancer. However, you may reduce your risk by not smoking or vaping.

HPV infections may increase your risk for developing vulvar cancer but can be prevented by taking the HPV vaccine.","Vulvar cancer is usually treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of treatments. The type of surgery depends on the size, depth and spread of the cancer. Your doctor will review all the options for surgery and the pros and cons of each option. Even with surgery, some people may also need radiation therapy.

When vulvar cancer is found and treated early, the cure rate is more than 90%. The key to a cure is to tell your doctor about any warning signs early and to have a biopsy right away. After treatment, be sure to go to all follow-up appointments that your doctor recommends.","If surgery is part of your treatment, your body may look different afterward. Talk to your doctor about this so that you are prepared. These changes may make you feel different or less attractive. It may take time to get used to the changes. Remember, your friends and family love you. Let them support you during this time. Do not push them away.

Even with treatment, vulvar cancer may not completely go away. Or, if it does, you may live in fear of it coming back. That can cause much stress for you and your loved ones. Consider joining a support group or talking to a therapist about your feelings. Invite your family to do the same.","• Can a Pap smear detect vulvar cancer?

454,Vulvodynia,https://familydoctor.org/condition/vulvodynia/,"Vulvodynia is the word that describes pain and discomfort in the vulva. The vulva is a woman’s external genital area, or the area around the opening to the vagina.","The pain associated with vulvodynia is usually described as a burning, stinging, itching, irritating, or raw feeling. Sexual intercourse, walking, sitting, or exercising can make the pain worse.

Vulvodynia usually starts suddenly and may last for months to years. Although it isn’t life threatening, the pain may make you cut back on some of your normal activities. It can also make you upset or depressed. It might even cause problems in your relationship with your spouse or partner. This is because it can make sexual intercourse painful.","The exact cause of vulvodynia isn’t known. Some factors may include:

• Frequent yeast infections
• Chemical irritation of the external genitals (from soaps, feminine hygiene products, or detergents in clothing)
• Rashes on the genital area
• Previous laser treatments or surgery on the external genitals
• Nerve irritation, injury, or muscle spasms in the pelvic area
• Diabetes or sensory diabetic neuropathy
• Precancerous or cancerous conditions on the cervix

Sexually transmitted diseases do NOT cause vulvodynia.","Your doctor may need to do a pelvic exam and tests to check for bacteria and yeast. If any test results don’t seem normal, your doctor may want you to have a colposcopy or a biopsy. Colposcopy is an exam of the genital area that uses a special magnifying glass. If you have a biopsy, your doctor first numbs your genital area with a painkiller, then takes a small piece of tissue that will be examined under a microscope.","Doctors aren’t sure what causes vulvodynia, so there is no sure way to prevent or avoid it. If your vulvodynia is caused by uncontrolled diabetes or sensory diabetic neuropathy, follow your doctor’s recommendations for managing your diabetes, including taking your prescribed medicine and adhering to improved diet and exercise.","Some types of vulvar pain get better with creams or pills made to treat yeast infections. Sometimes the pain goes away if you use creams that contain estrogen or cortisone. But cortisone cream isn’t good to use for long periods of time. Some antidepressant medicines can help nerve pain and irritation. Other treatments that may help include interferon injections, laser therapy, or surgery.

Muscle spasms in your pelvic area can also make vulvar pain worse. Physical therapy or biofeedback treatments (treatments that help you strengthen and relax your pelvic muscles) may help ease the spasms. If you decide to try one of these treatments, look for a therapist trained in women’s health. With practice, you can learn to relax your pelvic muscles with exercises you do at home.

If you have diabetes, follow your doctor’s treatment plan to manage your diabetes and gain control of your insulin levels.","Some of the following steps may help ease your vulvodynia symptoms. If they help, keep doing them. If they don’t help, stop, and talk with your doctor about other possible treatments.

• Try to avoid using soap in the genital area. Just wash with water. Don’t use creams, petroleum jelly, bubble baths, bath oils or feminine deodorant sprays.
• Wash your genital area frequently with plain water to wash away any vaginal secretions that may cause irritation. Rinse with clear water from a squeeze bottle after urinating.
• Wear only all-cotton underwear and loose clothing. Avoid wearing pantyhose or other close-fitting synthetic clothing.
• Use only white, unbleached toilet tissue and 100% cotton unscented sanitary products (tampons and pads).
• Report any increased discharge and irritation to your doctor so that yeast and bacterial infections can be treated right away.
• Try to avoid using contraceptive devices and contraceptive creams that might irritate your genital area. Talk with your doctor about other methods of birth control.
• Wash new underwear before wearing. Always rinse underwear thoroughly after washing to remove soap residue.
• Don’t sit around in a wet swimsuit for a long period of time. Doing so can cause an excess of bacteria and yeast in the genital area.","• What is the likely cause of my pain?
• Do I need any tests?
• What can I do to relieve my pain?
• Will medicine or some other treatment help?
• Is it safe for me to have sex? What if the pain starts to interfere with my relationship?","American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: Vulvodynia

455,Warts and Wart Removal,https://familydoctor.org/condition/warts/,"Warts are small growths on the skin that normally don’t cause pain. Some warts itch and may hurt, especially if they’re on your feet. There are five kinds of warts:

• Common warts usually appear on the hands.
• Flat warts usually appear on the face and forehead.
• Genital warts (condyloma) appear on the genitals, in the pubic area and between the thighs.
• Plantar warts are found on the bottoms of the feet.
• Subungual and periungual warts are found under or around the fingernails and toenails.",The primary symptom of warts is a rough-surfaced fleshy growth on your skin.,"Warts are a type of infection caused by viruses in the human papillomavirus (HPV) family. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Warts can grow on all parts of your body. They can grow on your skin, on the inside of your mouth, on your genitals, and on your rectal area. Common types of HPV tend to cause warts on the skin (such as the hands and fingers). Other HPV types tend to cause warts on the genitals and rectal area. Some people are more naturally resistant to the HPV viruses and don’t seem to get warts as easily as other people.","Most of the time, your doctor will be able to identify a wart just by looking at it. In some cases, they may also scrape the wart to look for tiny dots. These are the tell-tale signs of clotted blood vessels and are common in some warts.

In some cases, your doctor may be uncertain if your skin growth is a wart. If so, they may remove part of the wart to send to a laboratory for identification.","Some warts can be prevented, others cannot. Warts may be naturally occurring, depending on what’s causing them. But warts also may be passed from person to person by touch. It is also possible to get warts from using towels or other objects that were used by a person who has warts.

Warts on the genitals are very contagious and can be passed to another person during oral, vaginal, or anal sex. It is important not to have unprotected sex if you or your partner have warts on the genital area. Warts also can grow on the cervix (inside the vagina) without a person knowing it.

But some warts won’t go away on their own and need to be treated. Treatment may decrease the chance that the warts will be spread to other areas of your body or to other people.

There are many ways to remove common warts from the skin (such as on the fingers, feet, and knees). Talk to your doctor about which treatment is right for you. Also talk with your doctor before treating warts on your face.

• Applying salicylic acid. You can treat warts on places such as the hands, feet, or knees by putting salicylic acid (one brand name: Compound W) on the warts. After you take a bath or shower, pat your skin dry with a towel. Then apply the salicylic acid. The acid sinks in deeper and works better when it is applied to damp skin. Before you take a shower or a bath the next day, use an emery board or pumice stone to file away the dead surface of the warts. Apply the acid every day for many weeks as directed.
• Applying cantharidin. Your doctor may “paint” the chemical cantharidin on your warts. Most people don’t feel any pain when the chemical is applied. However, you may experience some pain and blistering of the wart about 3 to 8 hours later. Follow your doctor’s instructions for at-home care. When you return to your doctor for your follow-up visit, they will remove the dead skin of the wart. If the wart isn’t gone after one treatment, your doctor may suggest another treatment.
• Applying liquid nitrogen. Your doctor may use liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. This treatment is called cryotherapy or cryosurgery. This is a two-step process that does not hurt the skin around the wart. Applying liquid nitrogen to the wart causes a little discomfort. To completely remove a wart, the treatments may be needed every 1 to 3 weeks for a total of 2 to 4 times. If no improvement is noted, your doctor may recommend another type of treatment.
• Other treatments for warts on the skin. Your doctor may choose to burn the wart, cut it out, or remove it with a laser. These treatments are effective, but they may leave a scar. They are normally reserved for warts that have not cleared up with other treatments.

Genital warts must be treated by your doctor. Warts in the genital area can be removed, but there’s no cure for the viral infection that causes the warts. This means that the warts may come back even after they have been removed.

Note that warts on the skin and warts on the genitals are removed in different ways. Don’t try any home remedies or over-the-counter drugs to remove warts on the genital area. You could hurt your genital area by putting certain chemicals on it."
456,West Nile Virus,https://familydoctor.org/condition/west-nile-virus/,"West Nile virus is an infectious disease that can cause flu-like symptoms. It’s usually spread by infected mosquitos. It first appeared in the United States in 1999. Most people infected with the virus have mild symptoms or no symptoms. Rarely, the virus can enter the brain and cause life-threatening complications.

You may have a higher risk for infection by the virus if you live in an area where it has been found in humans, birds, horses, or mosquitoes. However, even in areas where the virus has been reported, it’s very unlikely that a person will get sick from a mosquito bite.","Most people infected with West Nile virus have no symptoms. However, about 1 in 5 people may have mild, flu-like symptoms, which include:

• Skin rash
• Fever
• Headache
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Diarrhea
• Loss of appetite
• Swollen lymph nodes (lymph glands)
• An achy feeling in the back and muscles

Symptoms usually occur 3 to 14 days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms can last from a few days up to several weeks. They usually go away on their own. Contact your doctor if you have any of these symptoms and have recently been bitten by a mosquito.

About 1 in 150 people who are infected with West Nile virus develop a more severe illness. This happens when the virus enters the brain. There it can cause encephalitis. This is inflammation of the brain. It can also cause meningitis. This is inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord. Symptoms of these illnesses include:

• A sudden high fever (above 102°F)
• Severe headache
• Stiff neck
• Feeling disorientated or confused
• Tremors or muscle jerks
• Seizures
• Weakness or partial paralysis

These illnesses can be life-threatening. If you have any of these symptoms, get medical help right away.","West Nile virus is most often spread by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected by biting birds that carry the virus. People can get the virus when an infected mosquito bites them. This happens most often in the warm-weather months of spring, summer, and early fall. You can’t get the virus from another person or from your pet.

In a small number of cases, people have gotten the virus through blood transfusions and organ transplants. However, the risk of getting the virus in these ways is very low.

A few cases have also been reported of the virus being passed from a pregnant or breastfeeding woman to her baby. These cases are extremely rare.","Your doctor will do a physical examination and ask about your symptoms. They will want to know if you’ve been bitten by a mosquito recently. They may order blood tests to confirm if you have West Nile virus. Sometimes your doctor may order a spinal tap to check for the virus. This involves collecting a sample of the fluid that surrounds your spinal cord and brain. If you’re having severe symptoms, your doctor may order a CT scan or an MRI to look for inflammation in the brain.

If you’re infected with West Nile virus, you may have a higher risk of developing severe illness if you:

• Are more than 60 years of age
• Have certain medical conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, or kidney disease
• Are a transplant recipient

Less than 1% of the people who do get infected with the West Nile virus develop severe symptoms or complications. Almost all of those people fully recover. Of the small number of people who do get severely ill from the virus, about 10% will die.","There is no vaccine to prevent West Nile virus in humans. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid getting bitten by a mosquito.

The following are a few things you can do:

• Get rid of standing water. Mosquitos breed in standing water. Dump water from birdbaths, flowerpots, wading pools, old tires, or other places where it can collect. Garden supply stores carry products to keep mosquitoes from breeding in small ponds.
• Repair screens. Fix any tears in window, porch, and patio screens to keep mosquitoes out of your home.
• Stay indoors. Mosquitoes are most active during dawn, dusk, and early evening hours. Try to stay indoors at these times.
• Dress appropriately. If you go outdoors when mosquitos are active, wear shoes and socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt. Loose-fitting, light-colored clothing is best.
• Use insect repellant with DEET. If you’re going to be outdoors, use an insect repellent that contains 20% to 30% DEET. Apply it according to the directions on the label. Talk to your doctor before you use insect repellent on your child.","There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus infection. People who experience mild symptoms usually get better after a few days. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers to help reduce fever and to help with any pain you may be having.

People who have severe illness may be hospitalized and given intravenous (IV) fluids. They may need to be on a machine called a ventilator to help them breathe. Their doctor also will try to keep them from getting other infections, such as pneumonia.","West Nile virus usually only causes mild symptoms, if any. Most people recover in a few days. Some symptoms may last a few weeks, such as weakness or fatigue. But they will go away on their own.

Most people who develop severe illness from the virus recover. But your recovery could take weeks or months. It’s possible that some of the effects the virus has on your central nervous system might never go away. You could have long-term illness, brain damage, or permanent disability. But remember that less than 1% of people who get sick from West Nile virus develop severe illness.","• Is West Nile virus common in this area?

• What treatment is best for me?
• Will cold or flu medicines help?
• Can my child get the virus from me?

457,Whooping Cough,https://familydoctor.org/condition/whooping-cough/,Whooping cough is a respiratory infection. It is also known as pertussis. Whooping cough is highly contagious and is most harmful to babies.,"Whooping cough begins like a cold. Symptoms can start a few days to several weeks after exposure. Early symptoms last 1 to 2 weeks and include:

• Low fever
• Mild cough
• Runny nose
• Dry or sore throat
• Apnea (a pause in breathing or shallow breathing, often during sleep)

Your cough can get worse over time. Late-stage symptoms include:

• Coughing fits that end in a “whooping” sound
• Bursts of coughing that last longer
• Vomiting after coughing
• Getting red or blue in the face from coughing
• Feeling exhausted after coughing
• Increased coughing at night
• Worsened apnea

Symptoms vary in babies and children, teenagers, and adults. For instance, babies cough less and are more likely to have apnea and turn blue. If you received the vaccine, symptoms will be milder and won’t last as long.","Whooping cough is caused by certain germs, or bacteria. You can get it if you breathe in these bacteria. It spreads between people when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You also can get it by touching an infected person or surface.",You should see your doctor if you or someone around you might have whooping cough. Your doctor will review your symptoms and listen to your cough. There are several tests to confirm whooping cough. Your doctor can swab inside your nose and/or throat. A lab will check the swab for whooping cough bacteria. Your doctor also may want to get a blood sample or take a chest X-ray.,"Vaccination is the best way to prevent whooping cough. The pertussis vaccine (DTaP, Tdap) is part of the recommended vaccine schedule for children and adults. Adults should get a pertussis booster every 5-10 years. Pregnant women and those in close contact with babies should be vaccinated. Talk to your doctor to make sure you and your family’s vaccinations are up to date.","Your doctor will most likely prescribe antibiotics. These will relieve your symptoms and kill the bacteria so you aren’t contagious. Infants and babies may need to stay in the hospital. If you have whooping cough, you should avoid contact with others, especially babies.","Whooping cough can last anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks. You may continue to cough on and off, even with medicine. Over-the-counter medicines for coughing do not help with whooping cough. You should rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. You can try using a cool-mist humidifier or taking a warm bath or shower. These can help clear your lungs and make it easier to breathe. Avoid smoking and areas where the air is not clean. You may need to stay home from work or school. Talk to your doctor about when you can return to your regular schedule.","• How long is whooping cough contagious?
• If my teenager hasn’t been vaccinated for whooping cough, should they get the vaccination or booster shot now?

458,Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome,https://familydoctor.org/condition/wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/,"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart condition. People who have WPW syndrome are born with an extra electrical pathway in their heart. It changes the rhythm of their heartbeat. That’s called an arrhythmia. They may experience a very fast heartbeat (called tachycardia) for periods of time. Symptoms can start without warning. However, certain things may trigger them, including caffeine, alcohol, and stimulants. The condition is rare and affects all ages, including infants.","Some people who have WPW syndrome never experience any symptoms. They don’t know they have the condition. Most people don’t notice symptoms until they are in their teens or early twenties. That’s when the symptoms commonly appear for the first time. If you have WPW syndrome, you may experience:

• Unexplained anxiety
• Palpitations (rapid thumping or fluttering) in the chest
• Feeling tired (fatigue)
• Feeling light-headed or dizzy
• Loss of consciousness (passing out)
• Shortness of breath
• Chest pain

Infants may experience a change of color on their skin (pale gray), irritability, rapid breathing, and loss of appetite.

An episode of rapid heartbeat can last a few seconds to a few hours.","The exact cause of WPW is unknown. However, in a small percentage of people, it is tied to an abnormal gene.","See your doctor if you are experiencing an unusual heartbeat. Your doctor will listen to your heart by placing a stethoscope over your chest. Additional tests to check for the disorder include an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). During this test, a medical technician or assistant will attach sticky pads to your chest (electrodes). These are connected to a machine that records your heart’s electrical activity.

Further testing may include walking on a treadmill in your doctor’s office. You will be connected to an EKG machine that monitors your heart’s electrical activity while you walk. Your doctor also may want to monitor your heart while you do your daily activities. For that, your doctor may give you a heart monitor to take home and wear during a normal day of activity. The monitor is attached to an elastic band that fits around your chest. It continuously records your heart’s rhythms for 24 hours. If your doctor wants to monitor your heart for more than 24 hours, your doctor might recommend an event-recorder. That is a machine that records samples of your heart’s rhythms. It can be worn for a couple of days or longer and allows you to notate or alert the system when you are having symptoms.

Another test, called electrophysiologic studies, may also give your doctor information about your heart. This test is more complex. You will be asleep during the test. You will be given an IV (intravenous line) in the vein in your arm with medicine that makes you relaxed and sleepy. Once you are asleep, your doctor will insert a small tube into your artery or vein. They will send small electric pulses through the tube to make your heartbeat at different speeds. The test will map how your heart reacts to locate specific problems. The test could last up to 4 hours.","Since you are born with the disorder, there is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid it. However, if you know that certain triggers, such as caffeine, stimulants, or alcohol, change your heart rate, you should avoid those things.","There are several treatment options available for WPW syndrome. You doctor may talk to you about vagal maneuvers. These are things you can do on your own to help slow your heart rate. These things include coughing or pushing down like you are having a bowel movement. If vagal maneuvers don’t help slow your heart rate, your doctor may prescribe an anti-arrhythmic medicine.

Sometimes, people must have their heart electrically shocked to bring the heartbeat back to normal. Your doctor will hold paddles against your chest for this procedure. For some people, surgery may also be an option.","It is possible for WPW symptoms to disappear over time. For those who continue to experience symptoms, living with WPW can be frustrating. Unless you know your trigger, you can’t anticipate when your heartbeat will become rapid. And you don’t know how long it will stay that way. Having to have your heart shocked back to a normal beat can be stressful.","• Will the medicine I take for WPW interact with other medicines I take?
• Can WPW cause death?
• Can I pass WPW onto my children?
• Is it safe for me to exercise?","U.S. National Library of Medicine, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW)

459,Yeast Infections,https://familydoctor.org/condition/yeast-infections/,"Vaginal yeast infections are caused by a fungus called Candida. Yeast are tiny organisms that normally live in small numbers on the skin and inside the vagina. The acidic environment of the vagina helps keep yeast from growing. However, if the vagina becomes less acidic, too many yeast can grow and cause a vaginal infection.

Yeast infections are common; every 3 out of 4 of women will have one in their lifetime. Half of all women have more than one infection in their lifetime.","Yeast infections can be very uncomfortable but usually aren’t serious. Symptoms include:

• Itching and burning in the vagina and around the vulva (the skin that surrounds your vagina)
• A white vaginal discharge that may look like cottage cheese
• Pain during sexual intercourse
• Swelling of the vulva
• Pain during urination","The acidic balance of the vagina can be changed by a number of factors, including:

• Your period (menstruation)
• Pregnancy
• Diabetes
• Douche products
• Some antibiotics
• Birth control pills
• Steroids

Moisture and irritation of the vagina also seem to encourage yeast to grow.","If you have symptoms of a yeast infection, your doctor will want to talk to you about your symptoms. He or she will also perform a pelvic exam to look at your vulva and vagina. Your doctor may also take a sample of your vaginal discharge. This sample will be sent to a lab to help determine if you have a yeast infection.","Here are some things you can do to help prevent a yeast infection:

• Don’t wear tight-fitting clothing or clothing made out of synthetic material.
• Wear cotton panties.
• Don’t wear pantyhose or leotards every day.
• Use your blow dryer on a low, cool setting to help dry your genital area after you bathe or shower and before getting dressed.
• Change out of wet swimsuits or other damp clothes as soon as you can.
• Don’t douche or use feminine hygiene sprays, deodorant sanitary pads, or tampons.
• Avoid using colored or perfumed toilet paper.","Yeast infections are usually treated with medicine you put in your vagina. This medicine may be a cream you insert with a special applicator. Or the medicine may be a suppository you put into your vagina and allow it to dissolve on its own. Medicine in a pill form to take by mouth is also available. Some medicine is available as a cream you can put on your vulva to help relieve itching.

If you’ve had a yeast infection before and are having classic symptoms, you may want to treat the infection using over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. There are many brands available that offer creams (two brand names: Monistat and Vagisil) and suppositories (one brand name: NutraBlast).

Although it’s rare, you can transmit a yeast infection to your partner through sexual intercourse. Talk to your doctor about treatment options if your partner begins to develop symptoms of a yeast infection.","Be sure to see your doctor the first time you have symptoms of a yeast infection. It’s very important to make sure you have a yeast infection and not another more serious infection. The symptoms of a yeast infection are also the symptoms of other infections, such as some sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Treating yourself for a yeast infection when you actually have another type of infection may make the problem much worse.

Some women (about 5%) have recurrent yeast infections. This means they get more than 4 vaginal yeast infections in a year. This condition is called recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). If you have multiple yeast infections each year, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able to prescribe a treatment that can help prevent the infection from coming back so often.

If you have been diagnosed with many yeast infections over the years, talk to your doctor about medicine you can buy without a prescription to relieve your symptoms and treat the infection.","• Do my symptoms indicate a yeast infection?
• Do I need any tests, such as for sexually transmitted infections?
• What is the likely cause of my yeast infection?
• What treatment do you recommend? Can I use an over-the-counter medicines?
• Does my sexual partner need treatment?
• Is it safe for me to have sex, or should I wait until after I finish the treatment?
• What should I do if I get another yeast infection? Do I need to visit you again?","National Institutes of Health, Office on Women’s Health: Vaginal Yeast Infections

460,Your guide to food allergy management and prevention,https://familydoctor.org/condition/food-allergies/,"A food allergy is your immune system’s abnormal reaction to certain foods. The immune system is the part of your body that fights infection. A food allergy can be mild or serious, and even a tiny bite of the food containing the allergen can be dangerous for someone with a food allergy. It’s important to note that this type of allergy differs from a food intolerance. Food intolerance, such as lactose (dairy) intolerance, is an unpleasant symptom triggered by food (bloating, gas, stomach cramps). It doesn’t involve your immune system.","Symptoms of a food allergy are usually immediate — within seconds to 2 hours. The most common symptoms of food allergy include:

• Hives (large bumps on the skin)
• Swelling
• Pale or itchy skin
• Itchiness or tingling in the mouth
• Metallic taste in the mouth
• Coughing, trouble breathing, or wheezing
• Throat tightness
• Cramps in your abdomen
• Diarrhea
• Vomiting

In severe cases, a reaction can lead to anaphylaxis, a deadly combination of breathing difficulties, including asthma, skin reactions such as eczema and cardiovascular issues (low blood pressure, dizziness, loss of consciousness). Anaphylaxis blocks your airway and requires immediate 911 medical attention.","• There are 33 million Americans living with a life-threatening food allergy. Of that total, 1 in 13 children have life-threatening food allergies
• There are 9 major food allergens that cause most allergic reactions, including milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, sesame, and shellfish. These 9 foods account for 90% of food allergies.

Although people can be allergic to any kind of food, most food allergies are caused by tree nuts, peanuts, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, fish, sesame, and shellfish. Most people who have food allergies are allergic to fewer than 4 foods.

Additionally, some food additives, such as yellow food dye and aspartame (artificial sweetener), can cause an allergic reaction. Although sugar and certain fats are not considered healthy choices, they are not associated with food allergies.","Through appropriate testing, your doctor will identify your food allergy as one of two types:

• Immunoglobulin E (IgE)‐mediated: This is when your immune system produces IgE antibodies, which can lead to hives, swelling, trouble breathing, vomiting, and anaphylaxis within seconds to two hours after consuming the trigger food.
• Non-IgE-mediated: This is when your immune system reacts without IgE antibodies. With this type, you can experience stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in stool, and delayed eczema within hours to days after eating the trigger food.

If you’ve had an allergic reaction to a food, see your doctor. They will examine your symptoms and ask about your health history.

Be prepared to give your doctor as much history as possible about your allergic reaction Some things to note include:

• The symptoms you have after eating the food
• How long after eating the food these symptoms occurred
• How much of the food you had
• How often the reaction has occurred
• Whether it occurs with other foods
• Whether it occurs every time you eat the food
• What type of medical treatment, if any, you received after having symptoms

Your doctor may put you on an elimination diet. This is when you don’t eat any suspicious foods for a while then gradually add them back one at a time. Your doctor also may perform a blood test to measure the levels of IgE antibodies specific to different foods. Elevated levels of IgE for a specific food suggest a possible allergy but are not always definitive.

Another test is a skin prick test. It works like this:

• A medical professional will apply a small amount of liquid containing a suspected food allergen on your skin.
• They will lightly prick your skin under the drop to allow the allergen to penetrate.
• If a raised, red, itchy bump (wheal) develops within 15-30 minutes, it indicates you may have a possible food allergy.

Finally, your doctor may perform an oral food challenge (OFC) test. It is considered the gold standard in testing for food allergies. It involves a person eating increasing

amounts of the suspected allergen (under medical supervision) until they reach the amount that might trigger a reaction. If no reaction occurs, the person can usually continue to eat that food.

Once a food allergy is diagnosed, avoid the food that causes it. If you have an allergy, you must read the labels on all prepared foods you eat. Your doctor can help you learn how to avoid eating the wrong foods.

Testing children for food allergies differs slightly. Recent studies have found that some food allergies — such as peanut allergies — can be prevented if they are introduced and treated within the baby’s first year. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommends that infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both be introduced to foods containing peanuts as early as four months of age to reduce the risk of a peanut allergy. Talk to your doctor before introducing foods containing peanuts at this early age.

Similar strategies may be beneficial for other common allergens, too. Always talk to your doctor first. They typically follow this testing plan:

• High-risk infants (those with severe eczema or existing food allergies): Introduce peanut-containing foods as early as four to six months. Do this only after making sure the infant is ready for solid foods.
• Infants with mild to moderate eczema: Introduce peanut-containing foods around six months of age.
• Infants without eczema or food allergies: Introduce allergenic foods freely with other solid foods, according to family preferences and cultural practices.","• Start with small amounts of age-appropriate foods, such as thinned peanut butter or well-cooked eggs.
• Ensure your baby is healthy and developmentally ready for solid foods.
• Introduce one new food at a time, monitoring for any reactions.

If your child has food allergies, give their school and other care providers instructions of what foods to avoid. Tell them what to do if the food is accidentally eaten. Many children usually outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, soybean products, and wheat. People rarely outgrow allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish.

Most important is to avoid the food that caused the allergic reaction. Next, eliminate the possibility of cross contamination in food preparation areas. An example of this is to properly wash and sanitize your hands, cutting boards, and utensils that were used to prepare the food that causes the allergic reaction.

Plan for direct exposure and cross contamination by talking with your hosts who are preparing food in their home, tell restaurant servers, and read instructions on prepared food packaging.","Living with food allergies can cause fear and anxiety when you’re eating at a restaurant or someone else’s home. You will always wonder if your problem food is combined with the rest of the meal. Also, if you have food allergies to most of the eight common foods, you can feel frustrated by the restrictions in your life. There’s no cure yet. People manage allergies by avoiding the food and carrying emergency medicine like epinephrine. This checklist can help:

• Identify the foods that cause the person’s allergic reaction.
• Know alternative food names (casein for milk or albumin for egg).
• Understand cross-contamination.
• Read labels. Pay close attention to the “contains” statements.
• Don’t be afraid to talk to your server or the restaurant manager when dining out. If in doubt, leave the restaurant.
• Keep your emergency kit with you always. If you normally keep it in the car, bring it inside the restaurant.

461,Zika,https://familydoctor.org/condition/zika/,"Zika is a virus caused by a bite from the Aedes mosquito. If you have the Zika virus, you can pass it onto humans. This happens through pregnancy, sex (oral, vaginal, and anal), and organ and tissue donation. Pregnant women and women trying to get pregnant are not more likely to get Zika. However, they are at risk of passing it onto their unborn baby. The virus is linked to an increase of babies born with smaller-than-average heads (microcephaly). This condition causes severe brain defects.

Zika outbreaks have occurred in United States, Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, parts of the Caribbean, and Central and South America. In 2015, these outbreaks reached epidemic proportions. However, there have been no recent outbreaks of Zika.","• Fever
• Red eyes
• Joint/muscle pain
• Headache

Few people experience symptoms. In fact, most people don’t know they have the virus. Symptoms usually last 2 to 7 days. It can last longer.

A baby infected with the virus in utero (in the womb) will have the following symptoms:

• A smaller-than-average head
• Brain defects/intellectual disability

• Pregnancy loss (miscarriage or stillbirth)
• Premature birth

Nerve disorders in adults and children. This includes Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis.",A bite from the Aedes mosquito causes the Zika virus. This species also spreads dengue fever and the chikungunya virus. This type of mosquito bites during the day and is attracted to stagnant bodies of water (these are bodies of water that have no current or flow). People infected with the virus can spread it even if they have no symptoms.,"Your doctor will do a physical exam. He or she will ask you if you have traveled to regions where the virus is present. There are two types of tests your doctor can perform to confirm a diagnosis, including:

• A blood test will show if your body is trying to fight off the Zika infection.
• A urine test will show the presence of the virus. It will be positive if Zika has been in your system for less than 2 weeks.

Test results usually come back in 3 to 5 days.

If you are pregnant and test positive for Zika, your doctor will add you to the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry. This list is confidential and free. Doctors and researchers study the data and the effects of Zika. You might require additional tests to check your baby’s health. Your doctor can test your baby for microcephaly during pregnancy or post-birth.","There is no vaccine to prevent Zika. Find out and avoid regions where Zika exists. Zika travel alerts are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. You are at greater risk if you live in a Zika area. You are at increased risk if your sexual partner travels there. If your partner has been exposed to regions with Zika, practice safe sex and use condoms.

Avoid mosquito bites. Wear approved insect spray and long clothes. Stay in places with air condition. Stay in places with screened-in doors and windows. Avoid walking near stagnant bodies of water.
